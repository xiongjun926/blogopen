 Often that alternative was a variant of Newcomens atmospheric engine
 This could be connected to a crank and flywheel to make a rotative motion; it might not work very evenly, due to the engines single-acting cycle, but could sometimes be made more so by using a heavy weight on the flywheel to act as a counter to the engines power ful downstroke
 Or, more simply, an atmospheric engine could be used alongside a waterwheel, recirculating water from below the wheel to a reservoir above it
 If the water supply was reli- able, the engine might need to be used only in the event of a summer drought
 Both these schemes found favour because manufacturers accepted the atmospheric engines higher fuel consumption as a price worth paying for simple and reliable operation
