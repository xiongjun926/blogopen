 On the afternoon of 29 December 1924, Edward Collins stood alone, in a large, empty room at the top of a house on the edge of (1)(2) Outside the window, slates on the roofs of an adjoining wash house and dairy were beginning to slip, chimney pots leaned at odd angles, the trees were without leaves and a line of old lamp standards leaned against a wall from which the paint was flaking
 Answering the question of why Collins felt obliged to collect the dust from the room and send it to the Science Museum in London requires some elaboration
 Born in 1736 in Greenock, Scotland, and dying in 1819 in Birmingham, Watt is best known for his work on the steam engine, which became a symbol of Britains nineteenth-century industrial prowess, and he was the first engineer to be elevated into the pantheon of national heroes alongside soldiers and statesmen
 As it happens, the Science Museum decided against acquiring the dust
 This is a little disappointing because, if the reader will forgive the slight stretching of a scientific point, the dust would have represented the dna, not just of the steam engine, but of the many other projects that Watt worked on as well: plaster of Paris for copying sculptures, chemical substances of dif- ferent types, iron filings and turnings, maybe bits of brass and glass from scientific instruments
 This is a book about making things during Britains Industrial Revolution, covering the period roughly from 1760 until 1820
 Within those param- eters, it will concentrate more particularly on the machine that became emblematic of Britains Industrial Revolution: the steam engine
 Recent surveys of the Industrial Revolution have emphasized the creation in Britain of a ‘knowledge economy, which succeeded because it could generate ‘useful knowledge and disseminate it to those who might exploit it commercially
 Having the infrastructure to support the widest possible flow of ideas was no doubt important to Britains economy as it indus- trialized during the later eighteenth century
 from which having almost all the previous learning it is easy to step to the other otherwise it must be uphill work
 This is not to deny that scientific knowledge influenced how things were made
 But it exists and has been drawn on for this book
 We can use these myriad sources on tools and techniques to delve into the world of making things during the eighteenth century
 Watts ‘perfect engine is a great example of this: it was an astonishing concept, a feat of experimental science, conceptual understanding and precision engineering, but that didnt stop the men erecting it on a windy cliff top in Cornwall, unloading it from a wagon by the simple expedient of just tipping the entire wagon onto its side
 Artisans had to develop products which could be sold
 The baseline for this analysis is that in Britain the practical contribution made by craftsmen and artisans was highly valued
 In 1803 the economist and businessman Jean-Baptiste Say wrote how ‘the enormous wealth of Britain is less owing to her own advances in scientific acquirements, high as she ranks in that department, as to the wonderful practical skills of her adventurers in the useful application of knowledge and the superiority of her workmen in rapid and masterly execution
 Beyond the innate instinct for technological creativity that motiv - ated these craftsmen and artisans, other factors as well as science influenced the paths that making things would advance along
 As the historian David Landes wrote, ‘the Englishman of the 1750s was closer in material things to Caesars legionnaires than to his own great-grandchildren
 It was not just the quantity of possessions present in households that changed but their sheer range, the choice of materials and how they were branded, packaged and sold as well
 It is difficult to treat these factors in a linear way
 It is to Watt that we now turn
 At a London meeting in June 1824 to call for a public monument to commemorate Watt, the Earl of Liverpool wrote that by his steady perseverance, by the sagacity of his mind, by his patient thinking >>>>>> he was enabled to apply the profoundest principles of science to the practical purposes of life; and >>>>>> augment incalculably the resources of his own country, and even of the whole world
 Such words quickly consolidated Watts reputation as a colossus of Britains Industrial (1)(2)
 In 1948 the engine was described by the histor - ian (1) (1) Ashton as ‘the pivot on which industry swung into the modern age, and more recently Watt was called ‘a symbol of >>>>>> everything that was progressive and innovative in Britain during the eighteenth century
 How, then, to carve out a niche in this busy marketplace
 Britain depended for its movers and shakers on its doers and makers, and Watt stands for all of them, regardless of their specific trade or profession
 The major issue to be overcome here is avoiding what John Griffiths described as ‘Wattolatry: the worship of (1)(2)33 An element of this is unavoidable: the Science Museum has four Watt engines and his library in its collection, and his voluminous personal and business papers are preserved at (1)(2) The path dependency of how we write history depends on what sources have survived, and this is skewed heavily towards Watt rather than many of his colleagues
 There are many others, from Daniel Defoe to Louis Simond, whose accounts help paint the bigger picture of a growing industrial economy
 Johann Conrad Fischer was a pioneering Swiss steel-maker who made contact with many of Englands eminent industrialists and manufacturers
 What comes across from many of these accounts is the impact of the processes of making, and the products that were created, on the contemporary imagination
 Later commentators agreed, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, who believed the English had successfully ‘impressed their direct-ness and practical habit onto modern civilisation
 One writer has it that Patrick OBriens naval stories of the Napoleonic Wars acquired a life of their own when he realized that they were ‘the Englishmans Troy tales, as historic - ally and mythically rich, and imaginatively exploitable as the story that produced The Iliad
 To return to the dust in Watts workshop, it represented the long, multifaceted and highly productive career of one man
 In asking ourselves whether we want the dust, the answer surely has to be – yes
 It contained timberyards, wharves, warehouses, victualling stores, brothels and gin shops
 The amount of drinking which went on, as recorded in accounts of the time, is amazing

 Infec - tious diseases such as tuberculosis, dysentery and typhus cut swathes through the population, and death could come from the most unex- pected directions – even the lead used in cosmetics could finish off the fashionable
 Britain in the eighteenth century was, in many respects, a society of extremes
 A medical operation could trans- form genteel appearances into bloody horror
 Watts early encounters with this world, his upbringing and training in the rudiments of business offer a valuable insight into the infrastructure that facilitated Britain becoming the worlds first industrial nation
 It was a world which, broadly, didnt go hungry: Britain could feed itself
 Crop rotation ensured that nutrient levels in the soil were replenished
 Britains population was also growing rapidly – from about 6
 This increase was based on nuptiality, or the propensity for people to get married and the subsequent desire to start a family
 The growing population was also increasingly mobile
 Others worked seas on ally in farming, and navvies hopped from project to project digging canals
 And the Romantic poet Robert Southey was struck by how travel ‘is one of the pleasures of the English; and people >>>>>> set out upon a journey of two hundred leagues to amuse themselves
 So, eighteenth-century Britain was getting more populous, and its people were increasingly likely to travel in pursuit of work and new opportunities
 Watt was the fourth child for Agnes and James Senior but the first to survive past infancy
 The breadth of Watts reading is demonstrated by a portion of his book collection, which survives in the care of the Science Museum (1)(2) Alongside As his parents look on, the young Watt experiments with the steaming kettle

 But he was not just content to read, and sought to expand from ideas into practice
 Moving to Glasgow placed Watt at the commercial hub of west- ern (1)(2) The quays lining the Clyde Estuary were crowded with bales of tobacco and boxes of herring, bar-iron, hemp for sails and nets, timber for boats and houses and salt for preserv - ing fish
 Watt Senior traded all sorts of goods around the (1)(2) A letter he received from his son titled ‘Invoice of goods bought at Glasgow records tanned skins, padlocks, a quire of marble paper, two dozen pencils and more
 His uncle John Muirheid was on hand to show him the ropes
 In fact, his cousin Marion Campbell recalls that while in Glasgow, Watt met with good society, and formed friendships with several intelligent and well-educated young men; they had frequent evening meetings to give or receive information
 The most useable highways were old Roman roads which still had their original surfaces left, but even these were prone to subsidence, turning into ditches which became morasses of mud
 recorded as lying in ‘low, flat, miry country flooded with rainfall from the surrounding hills which, ‘for want of a proper current to carry such waters off, [inundated a] great part of the road, which is frequently under water
 One solution was to build turnpike roads, paid for by users
 If roads sped the passage of relatively portable things like news or ideas, more bulky items went by boat
 Efficient shipping was crucial to the industrializing economy
 And, just as many British citizens liked a fight, so the country itself was extraordinarily pugnacious
 The ‘hands-off approach of central government was commented on by many overseas visitors, one of whom noted: Greenock in 1768, by Robert Paul of (1)(2) The town, where Watt was born and spent his early life, was an important port and maritime centre

 But while Britains social structure was closely defined, it was by no means overly rigid
 Rather, it was flexible – far more so than in France, Germany or Russia – and this helped Josiah Wedgwood query ‘whether I am a landed gentleman, an engineer or a potter, for indeed I am all three
 Although the cotton entrepreneur Sir Richard Arkwright started out as a wigmaker, for example, the movement  wasnt just up wards
 The law of primogeniture, meaning that the oldest son inherited everything, forced younger siblings into the professions and trade
 The close interplay between the classes facilitated industrial change
 If Watt and his young merchant friends in Glasgow aspired to ascend the social ladder, they sought to do so by meeting the demands of Britains middle classes, the customers for many of the goods they would make and trade
 On his travels around England, Karl Philipp Moritz stumbled across signs warning ‘Take care
 First, the tax system was highly regressive – that is, the wealthier you were, the less tax you paid as a proportion of your income
 So they were unfair, but freed up entrepreneurs money for investment in new industries
 It is against this background that Watt left Scotland for the first time, in June 1755, and travelled to train as a scientific-instrument maker in (1)(2) The precise motivation for this dramatic change is unclear, but he was now nineteen and needed to consider his longer-term prospects
 A basic premise of politeness was to maintain a respectable appear ance

 The involvement of a third party also characterized bills of exchange
 He worked on scales and rules for calculating and measuring, and Hadleys quadrants for navigation
 By June 1756 Watt was preparing to return to (1)(2) He had been in London for one year, less than the full seven-year appren- ticeship usual at the time, but he had the makings of a ‘sensible, ingenious and enterprizing Man, who plans and executes with equal Expedition – a later description of Birmingham industrialist Matthew Boulton, but one which seems apt for Watt, too
 An invitation to James Watts workshop at Glasgow College was highly prized among the colleges students
 Working at Glasgow College, Watt found that his interests were widely shared
 Like Watts college workshop these institutions became centres of debate and bred a uniquely impressive array of thinkers
 Having learned his trade as an instrument maker, Watt found himself immersed in the Scottish Enlightenment and a new popular culture that was fascinated by science
 Meeting his customers needs led Watt both to pursue new ways of making instruments and to branch out into their retail
 As Watt began his career making scientific instruments, he was launching himself into a culture where a vigorous ‘taste for science, over all classes of men, in every nation of Europe >>>>>> seems to be the characteristic feature >>>>>> In no former age, was ever the light of knowledge so extended, and so generally diffused

 Lecturers occupied a strategic position in promoting science in the wider economy
 By 1788 there were 12,464 ships registered in the uk, a number which would more than double by 1851
 Instrument makers stood at the intersection between practition- ers demands and new scientific discoveries
 Watt was held in some esteem – Black was later to recall Watt as ‘a young man possessing most uncommon talents for mechanical knowledge and practice, with an originality, readiness, and conspicuousness of invention, which often surprised and delighted me in our frequent conversations together
 Watt developed a reputation within Glasgow College, then, as the ‘go to man for anything that needed making
 In September 1758 he had a moment of appraisal
 He ended gloomily, noting that if his venture failed he would have to ‘fall into some other way of business as this will not do in the present situation
 He would use his inventive abilities to make instruments in bulk at minimum cost, not for professors at the college but for bigger markets beyond its walls
 He expected to be able to make ‘14 dozen every year or about three every week, and he was confident ‘of selling more than I can get made
 Another of Watts major products was a machine for drawing in perspective which he developed and sold from 1765
 The machines mechanism was delicate, and might not have survived outdoor use for long, but it employed some cunning features to make it compact and lightweight
 It was difficult, laborious work, and the optician John Yarwell wrote to the astronomer Abraham Sharp complaining about his difficulties making the lenses: ‘I must confess I have had more complaint from you than from all the rest of mankind, with the least profit, for the last you had
 Working brass and glass into precision instruments led to innov - ation in three key areas
 The precision engineer Richard Roberts employed his wife for this duty, working in a bedroom while his wife drove the lathe from the basement
 Screw threads – cylinders with an indented spiral running around the outside – were essential to successful precision instruments
 For example, James Short of London made reflecting telescopes only and John Cuff made only microscopes
 A consequence of this complex trade structure was that the name engraved on a finished instrument was a ‘brand name – that of a businessman and designer in overall charge of the manufac- turing process but responsible for physically making few of the components
 Far from being a solitary craftsman, Watt assembled a team of employees
 Only one of them, John Gardner, was with Watt for the long haul – in fact, he became Watts right-hand man and took over the instrument making busi- ness in about 1770
 Others can be spotted in the details of the sale arranged when the watchmaker Larcum Kendall died in 1790
 Many of the basic tools are similar, and these are a counter balance to the emphasis on mechanization, lathes and dividing engines in instrument making
 Historian of mechanism Michael Wright has even suggested that one of Watts projects appears to have gone subtly wrong
 But it hasnt been used much, and some detective work shows us why
 A year later, he wrote again to Small, ‘I had occasion to use my last dividing screw for the first time the other day >>>>>> It did not err the 1/200th of an inch in the whole 9 inches
 The London instrument makers were an acknowledged elite and their capabilities do not necessarily reflect those elsewhere
 He took a copy of Nicholas Bions The Construction and Principal Uses of Mathematical Instruments, translated into English by Edmund Stone, with him when he returned from London to (1)(2) Also in his library were Gregorys The Elements of Astronomy, Physical and Geometrical, Desaguliers A Course of Experimental Philosophy and Smiths Compleat System of (1)(2)64 And he borrowed Gravensandes Elements of Natural Philosophy from his father
 But whether Watts business demanded that he pursued such a theoretically grounded, precise approach is doubtful
 So for some instrument makers, ‘good enough was preferable to ‘the best, and satisfied their customers
 Concentrating on making instruments that were just good enough did not preclude innovation and awareness of the latest new theories in other areas, however
 There survive objects from Watts Glasgow workshop that embody this revolutionary approach – the theory that would underpin the rise of the factory system in (1)(2) And they are associated with one of Watts more surprising business ventures: making musical instruments
 Watt could add another string to his bow, so to speak, with relative ease
 was not unique in this respect, but the survival of such artefacts given Watts association with Adam Smith makes them significant
 But perhaps the fashionable young gents who would be Watts potential market in Glasgow were not too discerning
 Watt wasnt just making flutes
 He proposed a business partnership with Watt that would involve Watt relocating to Dublin, ultimately to no avail
 This is the earliest known evidence for the use of what remains a widely used woodworking tool
 Thomas Turner, a Sussex grocer, purchased scientific toys for his family: ‘I entertained my sister Sally, and my brothers wife, with the sight of the Modern Microcosm, which I think is a The ‘T Lot stamp from Watts workshop
 very pretty curious sight, for we see the whole solar system move by clockwork, in the same manner as they do in the heavens
 To launch himself fully into the world of instrument retailing, Watt entered business partnership in October 1759 with John Robert Sayer, Astronomy, c(1), engraving
 Craig, a Glasgow-based merchant and architect
 Watt was following a retail trend already established elsewhere
 Shops were places where an astute instrument maker would unashamedly show off his wares: to demonstrate his telescopes, John Marshall had his name painted in white on the roof of a house twenty houses away from the shop, and prospective telescope purchasers were encouraged to spot it
 Carlile must have been a daunting competitor to relative newcomer Watt, who seems only slowly to have appreciated the value of catalogues, trade cards and instruction books to boost sales
 Watts foray into the world of instrument making brought mixed results
 That Watt was himself aware of things going awry is reflected in a letter to his father of 1766 in which he wrote of acquiring ‘a stock of Experience that will soon pay me for the trouble it has cost me
 In the winter of 1763–4 a model engine was brought to Watt by John (1)(2) Anderson found that the model would only work for a short time before coming to a halt
 coal mine, burning unsaleable ‘slack coal, small pieces and dust
 Watts up bringing as a Scottish Presbyterian had engrained in him an aus- tere view of waste and economy
 This story was narrated by John Robison, a student at Glasgow College who had a curious ability to find himself present at some of the eighteenth centurys defining moments
 He can even take the credit for introducing Watt to the steam engine, having had a plan for an atmos - pheric engine published in the Universal Magazine in November 1757
 Watt eventually returned the model to Anderson; he had already sawn its pump casing in half, for example, and even more radical measures than Anderson would have countenanced were needed to make it work to Watts satisfaction
 John Robison walked without ceremony into Watts parlour to find him seated before the fire with ‘a little tin cistern resting upon his knee
 The separate condenser was possibly the greatest single im - provement ever made to the steam engine
 Instrument makers were at the heart of a new and expanding scientific culture that was as much commercial and practical as it was philosophical, and the technicalities of instrument making were solid foundations for the business of building steam engines
 into the 1860s
 Now, for Watt, the challenge of scaling up his engine meant he had to master the dynamics of the steam and heat contained inside it
 three Looking for a Living, 1764–
 Glasgow became, then, a prosperous reflection of Scotlands growing industrial and commercial power
 We have already explored Watts instrument making business, and his introduction to the steam engine, within the context of a burgeoning scientific culture
 The engine evolved alongside other projects founded upon Watts interest in chemistry, which had its most promin ent out- put in his work for Glasgows Delftfield (1)(2) And as chemistry depended in large part upon the manipulation of heat, so it was ‘A First View of Practical Chymistry, published in the Universal Magazine (December 1747)
 The Scottish Enlightenment saw close bonds forged between the universities in cities such as Glasgow or Edinburgh, and part- ners in industry
 In Glasgow, for example, John Anderson founded a series of informal lectures, intended for a broad public audience, and as Watts work- shop at Glasgow college had become a favourite meeting place for students and staff, so Anderson regularly visited the workplaces of the citys artisans, ‘giving them such information as was likely to benefit them in their respective arts, receiving in return a knowledge of those which he could not otherwise have obtained
 Andersons lectures were in demand because, after 1750, Scotland was home to a broad and strengthening range of industries
 Linen production stretched across central Scotland and much of the output was sold in English markets, reflecting the importance of the Act of Union of 1707 in bringing political and economic integration with (1)(2) Profits from lucra- tive trades such as the import of tobacco were invested in other sectors, including marine stores for shipping, glass, bleaching and metals
 William Cullen, distinguished professor at Glasgow and then Edinburgh until 1789, had declared, Does the joiner want a particular glew [sic]
 But it was Cullens student and assistant Joseph Black who most fully devoted himself to building bridges between research and its industrial applications
 It may have been his reticence that made him reluctant to write much down: he would not publish his important research on heat, for example, and it only became public when a pirated version of his College lectures appeared, unauthorized, in 1770
 Blacks consultancy illustrates the fruitful flow of ideas estab- lished in Scotland between philosophical science and its industrial applications
 John Anderson, c(1)
 In doing so they reduced bleaching from a process taking weeks or months to one that could be completed in hours or days
 And they also forged links with others like John Roebuck, who had established an industrial plant for making sulphuric acid near Edinburgh in 1749, and James Keir, raised in Scotland but working in England, who turned synthetic alkali manufacture into a commer - cial process for the first time
 Scotland devel- oped a prospering chemical industry that stands as a counterbalance to concepts of the Industrial Revolution as traditionally dominated by textiles manufacture and the application of steam power, for example
 This new industry had two key characteristics
 This prosperity was reflected in the expansion of Glasgow: the city grew from 23,000 to 42,000 inhabitants between 1755 and 1780, and ‘The Bleacher, working on one of the enormous fields where cloth was bleached white by the sun; from The Book of Trades (1824)
 But increasingly the ideas of the people were enlarged, and schemes of trade and improvement were adopted, and put into practice, the undertakers of which, in former times, would have been denounced madmen; a new stile [sic] was introduced in build- ing, in living, in dress, and in furniture; the conveniences, the elegances of life began to be studied [and] luxury advanced with hasty strides every day >>>>>> every person is employed, not a beggar is to be seen in the streets, the very children are busy
 Second, this newfound economic stimulus found physical form in a new culture of consumption
 of the inhabitants of Glasgow, more especially since the rapid rise of the manufac - tures, which have diffused wealth more generally among the people than before, has occasioned a consequent alteration in their dress, furniture, education, and amusements
 New consumer goods, as demanded by the denizens of Glasgow and across Britain, were not simply material possessions but signi - fied membership of a new, refined social class defined by prosperity and an awareness of the latest tastes
 The German writer Sophie von La Roche, visiting London in 1786, was amazed by the citys profusion of ‘watchmakers, silversmiths, china-shops, confectioners without equal, and the goods so elegantly displayed behind those fine glass windows
 It is uncertain how much they could partake of the fruits of consumption available around them

 A first son was born in July 1765, but died aged only four months
 The world around Watt and his family was shaped by increasing prosperity and the rise of a consumer culture which prized material possessions
 Another, of more imme- diate import here, is in John Roebucks pressing need for an engine to work at his coal mines
 Roebuck had attended the lectures given in Glasgow by Joseph Black and was a speculative investor in interests that included acid manufacture, the iron foundry at Carron and coal mining
 Watt, it seemed, was his man
 Watts partnership with Roebuck involved extensive work improv- ing the engines design
 The most immediate outcome of this work was that Roebuck was convinced of the ‘justness of the Principles of the engine, encouraging him to invest further and, in return for an agreement that he would receive two-thirds of any income derived from the project, he paid for Watt to obtain a patent on the separate condenser
 But he also had a growing family to support, and feared ‘growing grey without having any settled way of providing for them
 As we will see, when Watt did grasp the internal workings of the engine, he saw it as a chemical machine
 The scope of Watts chemical interests is indicated by the con- tents of his workshop, which is a veritable storehouse of practical chemistry
 Twenty-three, includ- ing gamboge, tragacanth, ‘cochenilla and turmeric, found use in dye stuffs
 Watts workshop, Birmingham, 1924
 That is not to say, however, that Watts chemical interests were not philosophical
 Even as the Delftfield Pottery was founded, the popularity of Delftware was beginning to wane
 There were two possible paths that Watt could pursue: to make Chinese porcelain or improve Britains existing domestic pottery
 Learning the secrets of this manufac - turing process was a project played out across Europe: it was first mastered in Dresden in 1709 under conditions of tremendous secrecy, and became a preserve of royal factories making luxurious tablewares for monarchs and their courts
 The alternative to a new domestic porcelain industry was to develop the already extant British earthenware trade
 Watts experiments on the bodies of his pottery wares were diverse
 While travelling to Birmingham in 1774, Watt also conscientiously noted that the ‘stone grows softer and gravel harder; he certainly developed a canny eye for potentially useful materials to employ at (1)(2)
 The success of Watts chemical work is suggested by the Scottish potter Robert Muirhead, who described one of his recipes for a fine, white glaze as ‘an entirely new art >>>>>> not discovered & practised by any other persons in Britain
 Watts developing understanding of the steam engine when he eventually returned to it
 However, Watts understanding of heat was far different from that of his successors
 Just as the laboratory chemist spent much time labouring over the furnace, so great ‘bottle kilns, named after their shape, loomed large in the working lives of potters
 But other products, including the creamware, were referred to only as ‘biscuitware after its first firing because of the colour, poros ity and absorbent qualities attained
 milli - grams
 There was now a move towards carefully obtaining the best available; Wedgwood specified precisely that clay obtained from Pensacola in North America ‘must be got as clean from soil, as if it was to be eat, & if they were to get several parcels, at different depths, & put them in separate Casks, properly numberd, I could by that means easily ascertain what depth of the mine is best for our purpose
 In his ‘Brief Analysis of Water by Precipitants (1810), A Wedgwood pyrometer set, 1786
 George Smith describes how ‘Good water has no smell; such as abounds in aerial acid, diffuses a penetrating odour
 Even the process of applying glazes depended entirely on the dexterity of the dipper, immersing each piece up to his or her elbow, remembering the rule that ‘the portion of the article which enters first shall come out first, so that each portion shall receive the same amount of glaze
 This is not entirely to play down the role of new chemical equip- ment
 The historian Arthur Donovan claimed that Blacks move from Glasgow to take up a post at the University of Edinburgh in 1766 was ‘the end of his career as a creative philosophical chemist
 By contrast, in 1766 Watt was only a short way into the engine project
 Black had begun his research on heat in 1755 when he was first appointed to the college at (1)(2) It is traditionally said that he first turned to heat as a fruitful area of research after considering that snow is not melted instantly on a sunny winters day but lingers for some time, and that an overnight frost does not immediately cause ice to form – both phenomena that would be widely visible during a Glaswegian winter
 Steam was injected beneath it, and the piston rose
 Scottish physician George Martine had also found that when two glasses of equal volume, one containing water and the other mercury, were placed in front of a fire, the temperature of the mercury rose faster
 Watts responses to the nature of specific and latent heat shaped the design of his steam engine
 By 25 June it had collapsed with liabilities of more than £1 million (£1
 With the finances of the engine project uncertain, Watt also faced changes in his personal life
 Travelling on business in Scotlands Great Glen during September 1773, Watt received a desperate letter: his wife was expecting a child and was dangerously ill
 Its physical size was matched by its cost – £2,000 in total,2 or over £125,000 in todays money – and by the impressiveness of its operation
 The engine built by Watt as business partner to Matthew Boulton of Birmingham was a landmark machine in the history of the Industrial Revolution and, in the aspirations for how it would be constructed, was unlike anything that had gone before
 First and foremost, the engine was a product of the metalwork- ing capabilities of the city of (1)(2) In the eighteenth century Birmingham had the largest concentration anywhere of expertise in metal manufacturing
 By 1780 six coaches every day made the journey to London, and mail coaches also travelled to Bristol, Shrewsbury, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and (1)(2)4 The town also had few of the restrictions on trade which could be found elsewhere
 And Robert Southey was ‘dizzied with the hammering of presses, the clatter of engines, and the whirling of wheels >>>>>> the devil has certainly fixed upon this spot for his own nursery-garden and hot-house
 The lecturer John Warltire ran courses in metallurgy and mineralogy, as well as providing tuition in the scientific method
 in Britain except London – until 1819, Birmingham men took out three patents for every one acquired in that other great manufac- turing town, (1)(2)11 William Hutton could with some justifi- cation write of Birmingham that he ‘was surprised at the place, but more so at the people
 At the forefront of Birminghams industries stood Matthew (1)(2) Born in 1728, he took over and expanded the family business working in the ‘toy trade
 Steel makers created corkscrews and buckles, sugar nippers, watchchains and snuff boxes
 A single pat- tern book from 1775–90 catalogues over 1,400 different product designs being made
 Boultons success was also based on an astonishing ability to network and exploit the connections of the world of polite commerce
 He showed visitors around Soho himself, and Samuel Johnson recalled ‘Tuesday Sept(1)th [1774] >>>>>> went to Boultons who with great civility, led us through his shops >>>>>> Twelve dozen of buttons for three shillings
 Boultons friend William Small jested with him about his networking prowess: ‘I hope the King and Royal Family, the nobility and the Ministry and your other friends are well
 With his manufacturing capabilities, and the networks of con- tacts at his disposal, Boulton was ‘an iron chieftain, and >>>>>> a father to his tribe
 He was enthralled both by Boulton and the Soho (1)(2) Reciprocally, Boulton was drawn to Watt by friendship but also, tellingly, by ‘love of a money-getting ingenious project
 To stabilize his finances, Boulton needed a new, successful business opportunity
 From reaching the height of their popularity in the 1780s, the vagaries of taste meant that, by 1791, 20,000 people working in the buckle trade were petitioning the Prince of Wales claiming distress
, with a mass of steel buttons effacing his coat, and one even incongruously taped to the top of his hat
 First, a ‘blank for each button was ‘Button Maker, from The Book of Trades (1824)
 cut out of a sheet of metal using the fly-press
 Press workers were in almost perpetual motion, swinging the flys (the large, weighted levers that gave the press its working impetus) from 14,000 to 20,000 strokes a day
 With the buttons shape and decoration finished, it would need mounting on a ‘shank, a shallow hook, so it could be fixed to clothing
 A visitor to Soho admired how this approach made the faculties of those involved ‘more expeditious and more to be depended on than when obliged or suffered to pass from one to another
 We can almost hear the heave and thud of the drop stamps, the tinkle of the button blanks falling from the presses, the whirring treadles of lathes and the thunder of feet as children raced boxes of materials from one workshop to the next
 John Wilkinson of Bersham, Shropshire, became their favoured supplier of engine cylinders and pistons, pumps and condensers
 Boulton & Watt offered an ideal solution to the difficulties faced

 Much of each engine was made of timber
 These three main processes were central to the manufacture of many parts of the engine, and would have comprised much of the work carried out at (1)(2) The centrepiece of the Engine Manufactory was a blacksmiths shop with two great hearths for heating the iron, and at least one lathe – probably a great lathe with a hand capstan to drive it, given the size of some of the components that might be turned there: the largest of these might be the piston rod that attached the engine piston to the beam
 Here was precision manufacturing scaled up from scientific instruments to steam engines
 Having made the unfinished components, and the cylinder, it was now time to fit them together
 But after that the final leg was completed by road, with huge teams of draught horses, supplemented by teams of men if, as in Cornwall, the mines were perched on cliff-tops or on rugged moorland
 The opportunities for injury reflected the nature of the engine- erecting process
 Botallack was famous for its precarious position, and the workings extended some way under the sea
 Even in the 1820s, the cost of producing a perfectly flat cast-iron surface was twelve shillings per square foot – one of Boulton & Watts engine erectors in Cornwall might earn nine shillings per week
 Drilling holes in metal was equally time-consuming and labour- intensive
 Watt would have been acquainted with the techniques of foundry, forge and fitting even before he began his partnership with (1)(2) From 1765, as well as making scientific instruments in Glasgow, and his experimental engine at Kinneil, he had built a small number of atmospheric engines for customers in (1)(2) And as the engine grew from a benchtop model to an industrial machine, Watt grew as well, noting in 1769, ‘I am not the same person I was four years ago when I invented the fire engine >>>>>> the necessary experience in great was wanting; for acquiring it I have met with many disappoint - ments
 Such were the calls on his time and expertise that he wrote to Boulton in February 1778: ‘I fancy I must be cut in pieces and a portion sent to every tribe in (1)(2)
 For Watt this meant working at his home in Birmingham with an assistant on calculations, correspondence and drawings, and only occasionally venturing onto the shop floor
 So Boulton & Watts men tended to be jacks of all trades, and they were expected to excel in all of them, producing ‘the well-known “Soho workmen”, whose services were sought directly or indirectly wherever their fame had spread
 This comes with a caveat, however
 For example, William Murdoch had quickly become Boulton & Watts leading pattern maker before being sent to Cornwall, and there his abilities led him to make small, largely unauthorized adjustments to the engines as they were built – often to Watts irritation
 First came new paper systems
 Now, to save time and effort, Watt developed the first practical office machine, which he patented in 1780, and which Joseph Black praised for its ‘neatness and propriety
 Boulton and Watt formed a subsidiary company marketing the press to others; 630 were sold in its first year
 Boulton realized that other- wise, ‘if any misfortune should happen and, for example, the pump- ing engine for a mine was halted, floodwater might drown the workings, which ‘might be ruined before a piston rod could be made
 And improvements were supported by care- ful experimentation
 straps, together with over-scale hooks or rings to hang weights on, and the other two are wooden latticeworks, one of which actually broke during the course of experiments
 use, initially a flat rate based on the saving in coal fuel consumed
 Boulton complained: ‘It is rather hard to work without profit and then not get paid
 It is tempting to say that Boultons declaration that he was making engines like buttons was canny marketing
 We can close this chapter in Watts career by returning to those practical matters which took up so much of his time, and that of his colleagues

 early supremacy in making machines
 Lastly, the presence of so much woodwork is a reminder that, although the engine became the emblematic machine of the new industrial age, it was being built in advance of many of the other industrial machines which would have assisted in its production
 Watt wrote of his first Cornish engine at Wheal Bussy, Chacewater, that ‘all the world is Agog to see its performance
 Within six years Boulton & Watts machine had almost entirely dis- placed the old atmospheric engine in (1)(2) The resources avail- able to make engines were sparse and the machinery was imperfect compared with later models, but in Cornwall, with its dense network of mines and workings, 52 engines had been built by 1800, along with 30 constructed by other engineers
 It was a portent of things to come
 The city of Manchester divided opinion
 Manchester was the city that set the benchmark for Britains new industrial towns, and the material that formed its primary prod- uct has also become an emblem of Britains Industrial Revolution: cotton
 The foundry yard is full of cast iron engine components, awaiting dispatch to customers
 Josiah Tucker wrote in 1782 that ‘silks, cottons and linens, combined in a thousand forms, and diversified by names without number, are now almost the universal wear
 Fashion had always existed, but what characterized the fashion for cotton was the breadth and depth – one might say the intensity – of the demand for it
 The name indelibly linked with cotton manufacture is that of Richard (1)(2) Described by Thomas Carlyle as a ‘plain, almost gross, bag-cheeked, pot-bellied Lancashire man, he was trained as a barber in Preston, Lancashire, and most likely became acquainted with the developing cotton industry as he travelled collecting hair Margaret Bryan, astronomer and physicist, and her daughters, as portrayed in Bryans book A Compendious System of Astronomy (1797)
 to make wigs
 Archibald Buchanan, who lived with him for a time, recalled that he was ‘so intent on his schemes that they ‘often sat for weeks together, on opposite sides of the fire without exchanging a syllable
 Arkwrights success was based on a new type of cotton-spinning machine
 This measure was intended to allow Arkwright control over who used the machines, by restricting their use to only the relatively small number of people who could afford to build a mill on such a large scale
 Arkwrights conceptualization of the factory certainly caught the imaginations of many of his contemporaries
 Watt was initially reluctant
 Sheer size ‘guaran - teed neither efficiency in good times nor viability in bad
 So, potential customers for their rotative engine wanted power, if they wanted it at all, on a small scale
 Watts rotative engine, as built by him from 1787 until 1800; illustration from John Fareys Treatise on the Steam Engine (1827)
 Many prospective customers were also very timid in their approach to power
 They could be led astray by engine builders like the two Matthew Boulton described as ‘drunken, idle, stupid, careless, conceited rascals [who] say, and their masters seem to believe, that it required the learning and knowledge of a University man to keep an engine in order
 Often that alternative was a variant of Newcomens atmospheric engine
 The same year that Watt patented his separate condenser, 1769, John Smeaton was beginning to apply cast-iron compon ents to a wheel at the Carron Foundry in Scotland, which was ‘found to answer much better than wooden ones and was ‘constantly recommended afterwards by Mr Smeaton for other mills which he designed, and by degrees came into very general use
 A waterwheel like that installed at Arkwrights Cromford mill might generate 12 horsepower but, by 1800, wheels of 80 horsepower were in use
 Others were less of a threat: an engine built by Ebenezer Smith and (1)(2) was described by James Lawson, an engine erector for Boulton & Watt, as ‘one of the worse made I ever saw
 As in scientific instrument making, there was room alongside the very best for those building machines that were just sufficient for the job in hand
 It is telling, then, that Manchester writer John Aikin recorded that only ‘some few [engines] are also erected in this neighbourhood by Messrs Bolton and Watts [sic]
 Together they supplied the town with a constant fug of smoke, ‘an inky canopy which seemed to embrace and involve the entire place
 Alongside the polluted atmosphere, Manchester at street level must have been an assault on visitors senses; in 1835 Alexis de Tocqueville described ‘the crunching wheels of machinery, the shriek of steam from boilers, the regular beat of the looms, the heavy rumble of carts as ‘the noises from which you can never escape in the sombre half- light of these streets
 If the external effects of engines were the subject of negative comment, the machinery inside, by comparison, left a very favourable impression on those who saw it
 A question arises, then, over who the people were to best deliver this modern, mechanical world
 Millwrighting was originally a peripatetic job, and millwrights, ‘like other wandering tribes >>>>>> went about the country from mill to mill, with the old song of “kettles to mend” reapplied to the more important fractures of machinery
 Such men, at once foul-mouthed, belligerent and highly skilled, found themselves drawn in two directions
 However, a second path allowed mill wrights to retain a distinct identity: the engine (or other power source) still had to be assembled on site, and its power trans- mitted to the production machinery that it drove
 Fairbairn recalls rising with the sun in summer, and some hours before it in the winter >>>>>> For the remainder of the day I had either to draw out the work, or to ride fifteen or sixteen miles on a hired hack to consult with proprietors, take dimensions, and arrange the principle and plan on which the work was to be constructed
 Practical work was matched by skill at negotiation and draughts- manship as well
 These factors attracted James Watt, who took an interest in clockmaking alongside his other Thomas Allom, Swainson Birley cotton mill near Preston, Lancashire, 1834
 ‘The Watch Maker, from The Book of Trades (1824)
 projects
 And even before that, in 1758, Watt was in partnership with Joseph Black and Alexander Wilson to make clocks – his workshop contains an incomplete timepiece movement and a number of unfinished clockwheels that may date from this period
 How clockmaking was organized varied across (1)(2) At one end of the scale were the makers based in (1)(2) The metropolis was home to a complex trade exporting finished clocks all over the world, comprising large numbers of specialized workers – Abraham Rees counted up to eighteen different trades – movement makers, spring makers, enamellers, brass founders and more
 These examples show that there were extensive connections between clockmaking and larger-scale engineering, and this was widely commented upon by contemporaries
 The mills internal mechanisms suggest the scale and complexity of some cotton manufacturing enterprises
 And in Birmingham he saw ‘enormous hammers, wielded by a steam engine >>>>>> crushing in an instant red hot iron bars, converted into thin ribbons
 Improved spinning machine by Sir Richard Arkwright, 1775
 Boulton & Watt capitalized on the imaginative attraction of machines by establishing a series of showcase engine installations
 A renowned visitor to the Whitbread engine, in May 1787, was George iii
 Watt wrote of their complaints, ‘They say it is inconvenient for the mining interest to be burdened with the payment of engine dues, just as it is inconvenient for the person who wishes to get at my purse that I should keep my breeches-pocket buttoned
 biggest competitor
 However, up to 1800 and even beyond, the small scale of industrial enterprise, even in textiles, where powered machines ‘achieved their most famous triumphs, limited the demand for radical transformation in engineering technique
 The road from the centre of Birmingham to Handsworth, on the citys outskirts, was pleasant and much frequented by James Watt, his family and their visitors
 He wrote that six Inventive, Creative Genius, 1795–
 In all these buildings steam engines were at work, performing their tasks ‘quietly, regularly and efficiently – a tribute to all that human ingenuity has contributed to their construction
 What is most notable about Fischers account is who was responsible for what he saw in the works
 This chapter will explore the means by which the business was con- tinued in the hands of the next generation after 1800: how the men who drove the business forward were trained, the nature of the challenges that they faced and how they responded to them
 Some aspects of the move towards standardiza - tion are still with us today: for example, Watt defined ‘horsepower as a unit of measurement for the first time, as a way to compare the power output of different engines, and to help establish how much machinery engines with different power outputs could drive
 The Soho Foundry was designed from the start along rational, pre-planned lines
 The Foundry was built around nine workshops, each dedicated to a particular process: for example, cylinder boring, turning, fitting, smithing and pattern making
 However, between 1795 and 1825, they built 102 – the majority after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 – and they proved to be highly profitable
 The Soho Foundry was a major landmark in the history of machine making: it was the first purpose-built factory dedicated to constructing machines
 Consequently, the Foundry received a series of extensions to provide additional workshop space in the first eight years of its existence
 By 1804 the total construction cost amounted to more than £27,000, over £850,000 at todays prices, but the whole debt had been repaid out of profits by 1812
 The young James had been intended to have a similar grounding to his father: conventional training in carpentry along with book- keeping, mathematics and the rudiments of running a business, with a view to becoming an engineer or a manufacturer
 improvement in relations – in fact they deteriorated, and he finally quit his home, having discovered that his father did not consider him up to the job of running the engine business
 In 1791 he relocated to Manchester as apprentice with Taylor & Maxwell, a company of cotton dyers and printers, and came under the influence of Thomas Walker, an ardent republican whose views must have appealed to his latent sense of rebellion, and Watt James Watt Junior portrayed by an unknown artist, c(1)
 If James Watt Juniors revolutionary education came to a prema - ture end, he still benefited from a further education of an affective nature
 Ideas were more vivid & associated together much more rapidly & so associated with words as to produce, perceptions perfectly novel
 This wasnt just a one-man project: Watt Senior designed and built the gas-making apparatus
 This is not to suggest that early engineers and machine makers were all nitrous oxide fiends and libertines, although Joshua Field recalled the 1820s ironmaster John Tickle as ‘an extraordinary character – a kind of excentric genious a Chymist & a Poet, which sounds close
 Classical influences pervaded the education that a young man like Watt Junior might receive in the late eighteenth century
 A student at Eton, for example, would attend 27 hours of teaching every week
 The influence of the antique is suggested by the schoolbooks, notebooks and reading undertaken by James Juniors half-brother, Gregory, totalling approximately 120 items, which are contained in a hair chest stored inside Watts workshop
 So, in advance of the emergence of a formal curriculum for training young engineers, their education might be both wide- ranging and disparate
 Ware was followed by James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, who published The Antiquities of Athens in 1762, and Johann Joachim Winckelmann, with his Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks in 1765
 and 1778 Giovanni Piranesi produced over 100 large, immaculately detailed and popular views of (1)(2) Rather than appealing just to scholars and antiquaries, these books descriptions and illustra- tions also became widely used source material for architects and designers, too
 Antiquity permeated the environment in which they lived
 With particular reference to those making machines, there survives a sketchbook that belonged to William Creighton, who rose from erecting engines for Boulton & Watt to become head of their drawing office in 1815, and was a highly active contributor to James Watt Juniors affective education
 Creighton noted the source that inspired each drawing, and from this information we can see that he used Wares Complete Body of Architecture, the Antiquities of Athens and Chambers Treatise on the Decorative part of Civil Architecture (first published in 1759), as well as referring to (1)(2) These, then, suggest that others beyond Boulton & Watt took inspiration from the antique
 It may be that producing work inspired by antiquity was a more accessible occupation than it might initially appear
 Rather than rigidly copying antique forms, with all the study and scholarship of the literature that would entail, Piranesi suggests progressing beyond those forms, using them as a platform for exploration and invention
 But they (the workmen) staggerd at the bowl, & did not know which way to set about it
 Wedgwood obtained the work for himself by cunningly suggesting they should ‘call in some able Potter to their assistance >>>>>> Would you think it
 Although the most attention was devoted to these very expen- sive objects, made in relatively small quantities, antiquity also found its way into the output of Boultons toymakers
 So, antiquity pervaded the environment in which machine- makers and manufacturers like Boulton & Watt operated
 William Chamberss Treatise on the Decorative Part of Civil Architecture provides a springboard for exploring how they did so
 that artists should ‘study the effects that flow from those works of art ‘which by the common consent of ages are esteemed beautiful
 Gwilt believed that we construct meaning about a piece of architecture by looking at it, by striving to understand it and by devising an emotional response to it, and we can frame an analysis of machine making and engine making in these terms
 The same year that Fareys book was published, Thomas Tredgold produced his own book, The Steam (1)(2) Reading both tomes together, Tredgolds is much more theoretical – as Tredgold described it himself, it is about ‘the application of science to art, and descriptions, drawings and rules of thumb are matched by complex equations and algebra
 But together, the books represent an immense quantity of knowledge about steam, codified and made available to readers
 However, the sudden expansion of publishing about steam raises an important question: Boulton & Watts partnership had ended in 1800 and since then, two decades had elapsed with no clearly formulated guides on how to make those engines beyond those materials already written by the firm of Boulton & (1)(2) Tredgold claimed in 1827 that ‘the effects that may be obtained by engines of different species, have now been reduced for the first time, to definite measures, and their proportions referred to scientific principles
 It is tempting to suggest that here was a system ready-made to be appropriated when designing engines
 However, these are just two examples out of hundreds where there was no precise association with the classical orders
 John Southern, head of Boulton & Watts drawing office until 1815, once wrote, with a dry sense of humour, We have rummaged all the ancients and moderns from Palladio to that great aristocrat and Knight Sir William Chambers in quest of tables and propriety and having altered and altered and altered again and again various ingenious and highly meritorious designs have at last concentrated the essence of our ‘labours in one which for taste, beauty, magnificence, and utility will vie with the most renowned products of any genius of any age or nation before the conquest of (1)(2)
 But if the precise nature of antiquitys influence is hard to quantify, what other factors influenced engineerings evolution after 1800
 As late as 1868, John Bourne was still publishing Watts rules of thumb for engine making – for determining the thickness of the connecting rod, the diameters of shafts and the size of beams, for instance – alongside more recent theories
 How far engineers actually stuck to Boulton and Watts plans is questionable
 The proportions followed at different times by the firm of Boulton & Watt, in cases where the stroke was not limited, vary from 1 3/4 to nearly three to one [that is, length of stroke to diam - eter], the most common about 2
 The occasional effects of these disparate approaches were seen by William Creighton in Glasgow, where he wrote in April 1803 of having ‘visited several of the engines here >>>>>> they are as usual dirty and from the insufficiency of thin framing & construction of the frames are all distorted
 This last quote gives us a way out of this impasse: Boulton & Watt set the benchmark for how the engine performed
 Not all engineers were single-minded, deadly rational beings like (1)(2) As may be surmised from the preceding debate, there was a tremendous range of opinion on the nature of engine making
 This was a defining moment in the engines transformation, giving it ‘a grace of motion not hitherto perceived
 All this work depended on improved pattern making and foundry work
 The potential of cast iron for multiplying decorative details in machinery was not lost on contemporary engineers, who wrestled Boulton & Watts ‘Lap beam engine, 1788
 First among these was the application of antiquity
 As beam engines evolved into self-contained structures from being built into a masonry engine house, columns proliferated, often fluted, with plain Doric and more ornate Ionic and Corinthian cap- itals, and supporting entablatures that included delicate moulded detail
 This quotation leads us beyond the purely antique forms towards other influences that came to bear for relatively short but intense periods
: the Henry Ford Museum has an outstanding engine by New Yorks Novelty Ironworks dated from 1855, which would not look out of place working in a cathedral
 Gothic forms were supplemented by an Egyptian revival in mechanical form
 If these startling reinventions of long-established designs suggest discontinuity, they are balanced by strong elements of stabi - lity and continuum
 This approach is best conveyed, not by Boulton & Watt in Birmingham, or even Murray in Leeds, but by the engineers of London and, particularly, Henry (1)(2) Maudslays works, just off Westminster Bridge Road and across the river from Whitehall, have been alluded to already: they were founded in 1798 and became a hothouse for engineering talent
 Nasmyth recalled Maudslays maxims for machine design: ‘First, get a clear notion of what you desire to accomplish, ‘keep a sharp lookout upon your materials; get rid of every pound Model Hick double beam engine in the Egyptian style, 1840, and displayed at the Great Exhibition of 1851
 of material you can do without, ‘avoid complexities, and make every- thing as simple as possible – or, as the historian James Hamilton has put it, understanding, economy, simplicity
 With ‘strength in the proper place, stability without unnec - essary weight, and simplicity of form without meanness, further ornament was unnecessary, ‘because their own proportions [would] constitute their greatest
 After 1800, two competing pressures shaped how this new approach evolved
 Other models became objets dart, with the balance between function Mortising machine from the Portsmouth blockmills, 1803
 and decoration tipped firmly to the latter: decorative ‘bun feet, spiral knurled columns, condenser cisterns or boiler casings sur- rounded by brass sheet decorated with patterns, flowers or leaves, even construction in silver
 This vernacular style emphasized engineers personal motivations and interests, not formal design protocols
 But Clegg in his turn had critics: some of his examples of tasteful engineering design were dismissed by the editor of the Civil Engineer and Architects Journal as ‘architectural monstrosities that were ‘vapid and quakerlike
 In treating the output of the early nineteenth-century engineers as art, then, we can see that its substance, and its virtues or defects, were both varied and contested
 The antique continued to hold sway into the 1840s but, in the United Kingdom at least, it was increasingly surpassed by the new functional approach
 When Hans Casper Escher visited Manchester in 1814, he wrote that ‘One must admire the steam engines here
 Sir George Head wrote of the engine supplying air blast to iron furnaces at the Low Moor Iron Works, ‘I have listened to a storm on the Atlantic, I have stood on the Table Rock at Niagara, yet never did I hear a sound in nature equal to this – so terrific, or of so stunning a din
 The emergence of the engine as a carefully styled object reflects its role as symbol of the new industrial age, signalling dignity, pros- perity and status as much as technical mastery
 This approach was entirely congruent with how the antique was appropriated and imitated in other industries, comprising ‘an evocation of objects in other forms, and indeed the new form might well surpass the original in inventiveness
 The younger Watt settled down to become, in the words of historian Eric Robinson, ‘a pillar of society as well as something of a dandy, while Peter Jones has him living ‘a solitary, bachelor existence with just a cat, a dog, and a Sicilian manservant for company
 The staircase up to the second floor of James Watts house, Heathfield, was steep and dark
 Watt, with his penchant for chemical experiments and instrument making, retired to the attic
 The room that Watt chose to be his workshop was at first simply a place to stow away belongings; in 1801 he sent for a quantity of possessions from Glasgow, and these duly arrived
 But the Watts workshop, as illustrated in Samuel Smiless Lives of the Engineers Boulton and Watt (1865)
 rooms solitariness was an advantage for Watts purposes: here he could pursue projects and experiments undisturbed
 The garret workshop had a dual purpose
 Watt devoted considerable effort to the machines, and they are emble - matic of a new world of mechanical sculpture, even a new world of mechanization as more broadly defined, that flourished in the early nineteenth century
 A portfolio in the workshop contains drawings of the reducing machine in an early form, dated 1804
 Development of the machines presented Watt with several challenges
 He wrote in July 1811, ‘I am not able to work any with my machine at this season my Garret being too hot to be tenable
 The machines built on a broader interest in sculpture, and con- nections to the sculpture trade, that reached back into the 1790s
 Watts reducing machine, re-erected in his workshop at the Science Museum, (1)(2)
 Nothing is known about him beyond this, but we do know that con- siderable numbers of mould makers or formatori came from Lucca, itinerant makers and vendors of plaster casts
 each
 Watt evidently purchased some items from Pierotti while the latter was based in Birmingham because, alongside his catalogue, there survives in Watts workshop a bill ‘for making moulds of Plaster of Paris, marked ‘Birmingham October the 8th 1792
 Many are highly complex, consisting of numerous parts locating tightly together using hemispherical projections (fitting into corres - ponding indentations), and with detailed internal parts to reproduce the complexities of the human form
 Returning from that experience, they sought small, portable pieces of sculpture that could be displayed in their homes as symbols of wealth, knowledge and connoisseurship
 By the mid-eighteenth century, then, a professional trade had emerged in England, to satisfy the demand for sculpture
 The precision obtained, then, was highly variable
 This background helps contextualize Watts copying machines: he had an interest in sculpture of some long standing, there was a widely held appetite for sculpture in materials ranging from marble to plaster, and low-quality copies offered the potential for improve- ment
 What is notable about all these machines is the length of time after Watts that they were made
 The mechanism was driven by an ingenious flexible drive and could pivot around a ball joint, creating a larger range of movement compared to Watts machines
 This gentleman offered to take out a joint patent with Mr Watt; but he had suffered so much from former patents, that he was unwilling to embark in any new concern
 That neighbour was (1)(2) There are no letters between Hawkins and Watt in the latters correspondence, and the details of any meeting are lost
 He left off pursuing the machine as a commercially viable project and contented himself with the technical curiosity that it offered
 Some months later Jules Janin wrote that this type of work ‘was made in six hours by a man turning a foot crank, while reading a new novel, and its implications were that ‘the Louvre Museum is no longer in the Louvre >>>>>> the masterpieces of statuary are reproduced everywhere
 Assuming a mechanical carver could produce two busts in a long, 80-hour week, perhaps three with practice, this was still far behind the output for producing plaster casts
 The two men exchanged final letters in May 1818, and the following year, on 19 August, Watt died at Heathfield, aged 83
 The small copy was signed on the back, in Watts hand, ‘Reduced from Gahagans bust by scraping 1807 – giving a date for the original and a pointer to one of the Gahagan family of sculptors, although which of them remains unclear, being the artist commissioned to make the original
 Watt was, then, generating images of himself in considerable quantities
 Faced with these new capabilities, Thomas Carlyle, in his essay ‘Signs of the Times of 1829, characterized the period as ‘not an Heroical, Devotional, Philosophical, or Moral Age, but, above all others, the Mechanical (1)(2) It is the Age of Machinery, in every outward and inward sense of that word
 Watts steam engine was the icon of Carlyles age of machinery, instrumental in ‘effecting the most remarkable revolution in all departments of industry that the world has ever seen
 Although historians have realized since that the expectations of steam, and its status as a symbol of progress, ran somewhat in advance of its actual employment, and waterwheels actually provided more power generation than engines until the mid-nineteenth century, this did not reflect at that time on Watt himself
 The Romantic poet William Wordsworth believed Watt was, ‘considering both the magnitude and the universality of his genius >>>>>> perhaps the most extraordinary man that this country ever pro- duced
 Watt became a new kind of industrial hero, compared to Isaac Newton in astronomy and William Shakespeare in literature
 The generation of so much iconography around Watt fed debates about the nature of his achievements throughout the nineteenth century
 The earliest articles that surveyed the engines development, in the Encyclopaedia Britannica of 1797, were written by Watts friend John Robison with input from (1)(2)63 An article in Olinthus Gregorys Treatise on Mechanics of 1807, accusing Watt of seeking to ‘repress the energies of his contemporaries and monopolize engine construction, was suppressed after pressure from (1)(2)64 After Watts death in 1819 his son remained avidly protective of his fathers reputation; François Arago, who wrote the first biography of James Senior, wrote of ‘the religious respect with which my friend the present Mr James Watt regards all that recalls the remembrance of his father
 This was particularly manifested in manipulation of the story that, as a child, he was enthralled by the steam issuing from a kettle
 as subsequently told concerned the potential industrial power of the steam, Watt and his son instead emphasized that it was about the steams philosophical properties – in fact, Watt Junior himself modi - fied the original account
 By comparison, subsequent biographers, most notably Samuel Smiles, gave Watts workshop prominence in their accounts, identifying it as a place of handicraft rather than philosophy
 The controversy over Watts legacy, and what he stood for, has raged up to the present day as engineering and science have been afforded differing degrees of priority
 By the centenary of Watts death in 1919, however, he had been firmly reappropriated as a craftsman and engineer: it is telling that one of the largest groups of contributors to the commemorative appeal launched in 1919 ‘comprised workers in engineering and metal- working firms throughout the Birmingham region
 However, amid the books and two-dimensional material, the busts and other sculptural representations of Watt, his workshop itself has sometimes been mentioned but rarely considered in detail
 As Watt was continuously reappraised and reappropriated by different groups, his workshop always remained as a presence in the background
 Even if it had remained untouched for so long, the mere fact of its existence cast a spell over those concerned with Watt and how he was presented
 Alongside these items, however, Watts workshop remained the ultimate prize
 That came to nothing, but four months later, Francis Pettit Smith wrote rather unsubtly to James Gibson Watt, ‘How often I have longed to take a peep into Heathfield >>>>>> where I am informed a host of invaluable relics do still exist – which in honour to the illustrious man should once more see the daylight – and be preserved to the end of time in some public institute like this
 By January 1864 no progress had been made, and Woodcroft, exas- perated, wrote to Pettit Smith, ‘I am ready to go with you any day to Birmingham whether Mr Gibson Watt gives his permission or not
 Woodcroft continued, In drawers were found splendid works of art carved by [sculpture copying] machines & produced in a variety of substances from marble, mother of pearl, to common deal
 were later returned to him by Mary Pemberton, daughter of the tenant, accompanied by a ‘kindly expressed note
 Woodcrofts fascination with the workshop reflected a very particular, mechanical view of the world and of (1)(2) This view was based on a realization that many of the industrial sites and machines of Britains Industrial Revolution were, even in the 1860s, at risk of destruction
 The engineer (1) (1) Fischer revisited the Soho Foundry in July 1851, but reported that this great plant had suffered a complete decline >>>>>> The many workshops were quite empty, deserted, and decayed >>>>>> I would never have believed so rapid a change possible had I not seen it with my own eyes
 Individual machines also faced an uncertain future
 Unsurprisingly the engine was described as being ‘in a very rusty dilapidated condition by 1862
 Even if an artefact did perchance find its way to a museum, its survival was still not guaranteed, because popular fascination with historic machines was manifested in a very tactile, hands-on way
 In the 1860s visitors to the Patent Office Museum treated the historic machines in the same way
 The heroic objects pictured include Richard Arkwrights spinning machine at bottom left, the locomotive Rocket alongside it, and the ‘Comet marine engine at top right
 facsimile of a small engine that had belonged to his illustrious predecessor, which was almost certainly intended as a gift to smooth the path of negotiation towards acquiring the workshop
 A com- peting group, the Birmingham-based Committee of the James Watt Memorial, was also attempting to preserve the workshop in April 1865
 The workshop remained at Heathfield for the rest of the nine- teenth century
 This is uncharacteristic of a man who was usually so bullish, and it would have been a source of some regret to him that the sacred precincts of the workshop were being violated
 Far from being undisturbed, the workshop contents were subject to some considerable disruption
 It may have been during this period that a lavatory pan dating from the 1850s found its way, upended, into one corner of the room
 The multifaceted nature of the workshop had already been noted by Samuel Smiles when he visited it in 1864 or 1865, and his evo- cation of what he saw is valuable enough to be quoted in detail: Many objects lay about or in the drawers >>>>>> busts, medallions, and figures, waiting to be copied by the sculpture machine, many medallion moulds, a store of plaster of Paris, and a box of plaster casts from (1)(2) Here are Watts ladles for melting lead, his foot-rule, his glue-pot, his hammer
 Only in 1924 did a plan for preserving this diverse range of items finally coalesce
 In April 1924 Henry Lyons, director of the Science Museum in London, was in contact with Major Gibson Watt, and by November 1924 it was clear that the house would not be saved
 Watt would most likely be embarrassed at the amount of attention the workshop receives
 To conclude, then, we return to the question of whether Watt was a philosopher or a craftsman
