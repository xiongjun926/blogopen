Watt took the fact that this ‘charcoal in a state of solution could not be removed in the same way as the fi xed air (by passing it through water or alkali) as evidence that it was not ‘fi xed air completely formed
And since he regarded fi xed air as a saturated solution of charcoal in ‘oxygene air, the implication was that the ‘charcoal in a state of solution is an unsaturated solution
In these ways charcoal was present in large quantities in heavy infl ammable air
In fact, Watt said, ‘no substance is dissolved in infl ammable air in such quantities as charcoal, nor more intimately united
So, when Watt wrote about charcoal, or other substances, being dissolved in airs he was describing what he considered to be a process of chemical union that could exhibit degrees of intimacy
Th is idea was very important to Watts estimate of therapeutic possibili- ties
Th e anticipated effi  cacy of heavy infl ammable air, and his special interest in it, was based in Watts thinking on the amount of charcoal that it contained
Given the value of charcoal itself in ‘correcting putridity, an air containing it should exhibit similar eff ects upon the body
However, in the case of treating consumption with airs, not just any old state of charcoal would do, according to (1)(2) Th e charcoal had to enter the bloodstream
Watt considered this unlikely to occur in the case of fi xed air (a saturated solution of charcoal in ‘oxygene air) because the lungs would not be able to decompose it
But the ‘other sub- stance in heavy infl ammable air that was an unsaturated solution of charcoal was more promising: ‘Whether charcoal in this state could be decomposed by any excess of oxygene in the blood of consumptive patients, I cannot say; but it seems likely that it would, and at any rate it would act as charcoal powder does, and therefore highly merits trial
Overall it appears that Watts chemistry of airs, as he mobilized it in the mid-1790s was still grounded in his early ideas of the interconvertibility of airs as modifi ed by the subsequent debates on phlogiston theory, but that new ideas about airs as solutions had also been added
It is worth considering where those new ideas might have come from
Watts views on degrees of intimacy of chemical union and on processes of solution as creating compounds are reminiscent of ideas expressed by Claude- Louis Berthollet in his major works on affi  nity
At fi rst sight, however, the idea that Watt derived these concepts from Berthollet seems implausible because the Frenchmans major publications on the subject did not appear until the early nineteenth century
Th e possibility remains, however, because Berthollets ideas on solution and indefi nite proportions were present, albeit in unsystematic form, in his earlier publications, including his writings on bleaching and dyeing, with which, as we have seen, Watt was very familiar
Th e intensive interac- tions between Watt and Berthollet make it very likely that the Frenchmans ideas on affi  nities and degrees of intimacy of chemical union, as expressed in his published papers and in his book on dyeing, were known to Watt who then deployed similar notions in thinking about airs when he turned to the pneumatic project
When Lavoisier in 1789 touched on affi  nities as the transcendental part of chemistry, he tipped his hat to Berthollet, whose researches in this fi eld were already underway
Once we realize that Watt was working with this concept of degrees of inti- macy of union, his ideas about the relative therapeutic value of airs become clearer
One clear statement of this is made in a letter that Watt intended to send to Dr Th omas Percival in November 1794
Writing of fi xed air, Watt stated that it ‘not only acts by exclusion of the oxygene, but also acts upon the nerves & upon the blood and that fi xed air thus has ‘positive powers
His guess from Priestleys experiments was that the fi xed air would ‘carbonize the blood
By contrast, infl ammable air (meaning here light infl ammable air or ‘hydrogene) ‘seems to act principally [sic] by the exclusion of oxygene, unless when mixed with some other substance, such as those which give it smell, or the Iron or Zinc it contains
Hydro carbonate, produced by the action of charcoal on steam, like fi xed air, produced by the action of charcoal on ‘oxygene, ‘seems either to be rap- idly absorbed by the blood or to act powerfully on the nerves
Hydro carbonate ‘seems to be the essence of fi xt air
Whilst Watt acknowledged those aspects of pneumatic medicine that involved the administration of excess oxygen or its reduction by processes of exclusion, he was particularly interested in what he called the ‘positive powers of airs that deliv- ered substances to the blood and acted upon it
Th e ability to deliver depended upon how close the union of the substance in the air was
Th ere appears to have been a hierarchy of eff ectiveness
Light infl ammable air or ‘hydrogene air was the least eff ective in this regard because it consisted of ‘the most perfect union of charcoal with water
Perhaps the perfection of this union meant that the charcoal could not be given up to the blood whereas in the case of less perfect unions of charcoal in fi xed air and hydro carbonate it could be so given up
Th is appears to be what Watt was trying to say to Beddoes in a letter of March 1795: I have formed an opinion, that, Oxygene & Hydrocarbonate are the only airs neces- sary to be employed
I think that the effi  cacy of Hydrogen (so called) depends intirely upon the Hydro carbonate it contains & that in fact it [the referent here is ‘hydrogen proper] may turn out to be nothing else than a more perfect union of charcoal with water… As to oxygen I am of opinion that in all ill conditioned ulcers, cancers not excepted that the breathing it will prove useful
An even fuller understanding of Watts perspective on pneumatic medicine and the chemistry of airs can be gained by examining his correspondence with Bed- does and others at the height of his activity
Th e Considerations was fi rst published in October 1794, some four months aft er Jessys death on 6 (1)(2) In the interven- ing period, Watt (signifi cantly aided by his younger son, Gregory) had engaged in a fevered bout of experimentation
Stimulated by the need to bury his grief in activity, and prompted by the hope of saving others from the fate of his daughter, Watt tackled many aspects of the production and medical use of airs during this period
Th is initial burst of activity was quite brief, and ended as rapidly as it began
Writing to Beddoes on 25 October, Watt observed: ‘Gregory went off  last night, & my laboratory is full of potatoes, so no more airs just now
Although Watt did have some early involvement in the actual treatment of patients he found this uncomfortable and opted for self-experimentation
Watt dosed himself and reported the eff ects
On one occasion Gregory smelt an air and woke up prostrate staring at the ceiling
Watt and Gregory did most of their work on experiments that allowed Watt to provide hints to Beddoes and others about how best to produce diff erent kinds of airs
While some products car- ried over with airs might be therapeutic, others, such as acids, could do damage and had to be removed
Watt also did much work on removing the smells of air, this not only to make them more palatable in treatment, but also to investigate whether the nausea induced by smell was the causal agent in any curative eff ect, or not
Beyond all this, though, Watt saw these experiments as part of an inves- tigation into the nature of airs
His correspondence on medical and production aspects oft en switches to consideration of the chemistry of airs per se
Despite his disclaimer in the Considerations that in this work he was neutral between old and new chemical systems and was just off ering facts, the facts that Watt pro- duced he saw and valued precisely as they threw light on the phlogiston issue
Describing to Darwin the apparatus that he had developed, and how it would be used, Watt reminded his friend ‘I am still a sceptic as to the antiphlogistic theory in general though I believe some part of it
Writing to another corre- spondent a few months later, outlining his approach to pneumatic medicine and the facts on which his views were based, Watt explained his habitual use of the term ‘infl ammable air rather than ‘hydrogene: ‘I dislike the word Hydrogene as possibly not founded in fact
In these little ways Watt reminded his cor- respondents that his approach to pneumatic medicine was, for all his vaunted even-handedness about facts in public, based on a theoretical position at odds with the new chemistry
Th e clearest evidence for Watts theoretical views on airs at this time, but in a frustratingly fragmented form, comes in correspondence with Beddoes just as they were fi nalizing the proofs of (1)(2) In a letter of 3 September Watt mentioned that he had enclosed a ‘2d memoir upon airs
Th is memoir has not been located, but Watts previous letter to Beddoes (itself imperfectly preserved) contains a disquisition on airs that may well have been a fi rst memoir
Th e status of these memoirs is unclear, but they seem to have been separate from the mate- rial that Watt contributed to the (1)(2) Th at material was referred to in correspondence as the ‘description of the apparatus or as ‘hints on airs, not as a memoir or memoirs
Perhaps the memoirs were contemplated for inclusion in the Considerations, although their explicitly controversial character would have been completely out of tune with the rhetorical stance otherwise adopted in that pub- lication
Maybe Watt was considering publishing them elsewhere
Whatever the case, the fragment of what is probably the fi rst memoir on airs refers to ‘another proof that no air can be made without water & that it forms the principal part of its gravitating matter, and continues, ‘Airs, then, consist of water or steam united to some other substances, all in themselves unknown, except charcoal
A few days later Watt added another comment that clarifi es his point: My opinion I have hinted before that water in specie forms the greater part of all airs, & I think the heavy infl ammable air should be named Hydro carbonate for if it can be produced in so small a mixture as 1/12 of fi xt air as Dr Priestley affi  rms what becomes of the oxygen if the water is supposed to be decomposed[
]
Hydrocarbonate is so important to Watt because it is the archetypical air pro- duced by dripping water onto red-hot charcoal
If the water was decomposed in the process then one would expect a signifi cant proportion of fi xed air to be produced
Since this was not always the case, the water must not be decomposed but rather enter into airs in specie, that is, in the actual form of water
Watt here is making it clear that he is aligned with Priestley in fi ghting what Darwin, Beddoes and many other British chemists by this time regarded as a rearguard action against the ‘new chemistry
Watt and Priestley had, as we have seen, long worked closely together and, although their relationship was not so close in the 1790s, they continued to refer to each others work to bolster their position
Aft er his departure from Birmingham aft er rioters attacked and burned his house, Priestley resumed work in London and from there in 1793 published Experiments on the Generation of Air fr om (1)(2) In this he reprinted a Philo- sophical Transactions paper in which he argued that it was probable ‘that water, as I have lately advanced, is only the basis of those kinds of air [dephlogisticated and infl ammable] as well as of every other
Th is work was dedicated to the members of the Lunar Society and anticipated Priestleys imminent departure for the United (1)(2) Th ere, as is well known, Priestley continued to write in support of the phlogiston theory
He also took an interest in Watts work on medicinal airs, while Watt sent him an apparatus
In Th e Doctrine of Phlogiston Established, Priestley noted that his experiment showing that the slow passage of steam over red-hot charcoal produced nothing but infl ammable air had been ‘confi rmed by (1)(2) Watt, whose accuracy no person will call in question: He [Watt] says in his Description of a pneumatical apparatus, subjoined to Dr Bed- doess Considerations on the medicinal use of factitious air, p(1) ‘It has been observed by (1)(2) Priestley, and confi rmed by my experience, that when much water passes in the form of steam, there is much fi xed air formed; but little or none when the water is admitted so sparingly that no steam reaches the refrigeratory
Priestley, if not Watt, was happy to implicate Watts contribution to the Con- siderations, publicly as well as privately, in a rearguard defence of phlogiston theory
For Watt, as we have seen, the theoretical background to his understanding of airs, and to his hopes for their successful therapeutic use, was more complex
Whilst he saw some virtues in the new chemistry, he remained a phlogistian
His theoretical refl exes in the 1790s still harked back to ideas formed early in his chemical investigations about the inter-convertibility of diff erent airs
Th e puzzle for Watt was still very much framed as about fi nding out what it was that accounted for interconversions
But despite these deep continuities in his thought, Watt drew (in magpie-like fashion) on other chemical ideas
It appears that Watt adopted ideas about solutions and degrees of chemical union from Berthollet as a result of their exchanges about bleaching and dyeing, which he then deployed in his thinking about airs in the 1790s
As Dyck pointed out, Watts distinctive chemical explanation in his work on  the composition of water was lost during the assimilation of Blacks doctrines  to the new Lavoisian system in the 1780s and 1790s
Watt had pursued some  of the explanatory possibilities that Blacks ideas off ered for conceptualizing  chemical change in terms of latent heat in a way that the great teacher himself  had not
Once Blacks ideas were subsumed into another system, Watts work  would come to seem idiosyncratic
Even by the late 1780s and 1790s this proc- ess was underway, with Black contributing to the process himself in his lectures  by his incorporation of Lavoisian ideas
Occasionally something of the Scottish  tradition in its unassimilated form could be seen, Robisons articles in the third  edition (1797) of the Encyclopaedia Britannica being a prime example
My point about Watts chemistry, then, is a simple but little-heeded one
To understand its character and substance we need to assess the way that Watt  drew upon a series of collaborative relationships, a number of them connected  directly with practical ventures
First, we should look to his involvement with  the Black tradition and the resources available to him from predecessors such as  Boerhaave, Cullen, Eller and the like
From these resources, and from his own  experimental work on the properties of steam (in the laboratory and, it must  not be forgotten, in the large through the actual construction and operation  of engines), Watt developed ideas about water and steam in which they were  compounded with heat
Th is re-contextualization of Watts chemistry makes it  clear that throughout his active work on the steam engine, and consistent with his larger chemical views, for Watt steam was a compound of water and latent  heat
Watt found support for his ideas in the meteorology of De Luc and in his  chemical collaboration with (1)(2) Th at collaboration was based in part on  Watts predilection for the theoretical interpretation of the experiments of oth- ers, but this does not mean that Watt was entirely dependent on Priestley for  experimental fodder, as many accounts have assumed
Watt conducted numer- ous experiments of his own, especially on dephlogisticated air
Th ese, together  with his earlier steam experiments (to which he continually returned with a view  to refi ning and extending them) gave him an independent experimental base  from which to develop and maintain his chemical ideas about water, steam and  airs
Once we realize this then Watt is no longer quite the victim to the experi- mental failures of Priestley that he is usually portrayed as
Watts publications in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society  in 1784 were important in themselves, and also because they opened a wider  world of chemical contacts to him
His visit to Paris in 1786 brought him within  the ambit of a number of important French chemists
Th ese included Lavoisier  himself, but arguably the most important of them from Watts perspective was  (1)(2) For it was Berthollet who not only confi ded his methods of chlorine  bleaching but also discussed with Watt, in their correspondence, larger questions  of chemical nomenclature and process
Th e accumulated knowledge and technique thus acquired from his multiple  collaborations and his own extensive experimental work were brought to bear on  his fi nal major collaboration, with Beddoes on the pneumatic medicine project
I have argued that in this project, too, Watts work – usually seen as the prac- tical contribution of an engineer – was in fact both chemically informed and  chemically signifi cant
Watt certainly hoped for medical benefi ts from the ven- ture but his chemical curiosity was also piqued
His emphasis on the potential  medical value of hydrocarbonate was a result of his theoretical reasoning about  the nature and mode of action of that ‘air
Th ree chemical components – the  chemical theory of heat, ‘oxygene theory reconciled to the continued impor- tance of phlogiston, and an affi  nity theory which allowed for the combination of  substances in varying degrees – all entered into that reasoning
Insofar as treat- ments were found to work – and there were many hopeful signs – the pneumatic  project provided further justifi cation for the value of the assembly of chemical  understandings that Watt brought to it
Th at Watts chemical understandings were later to represent a crime against  progress for characters such as William Whewell, or an embarrassing archaicism  for Watts nineteenth-century supporters in the water controversy, should not  be allowed to obscure them for us now
Getting Watts chemistry in focus makes  clearer its thematic importance to virtually all his practical ventures, including  his steam engine innovations
It is to that specifi c connection that I now turn in the fi nal two chapters
– 125 – 5 THE STEAM ENGINE AS CHEMISTRY Th ere are two ways in which the centrality of the chemistry of heat, water and steam to Watts steam engine improvements can be discerned
One, which will be pursued later in this chapter, is to reconstruct in a technical sense – building on what we now know about Watts chemistry – the conceptual world in which, and through which, Watts thinking about the steam engine took place
A second is to gain an appreciation of what we might call the ‘ecology of steam
By this I mean the broader chemical cosmology, embracing meteorology and geology, of which steam and the steam engine were a part, for Watt and his contemporaries
I start with the wider chemical picture
Th e Ecology of Steam: Meteorology, Geology and Th e Botanic Garden Newcomen engines are known as ‘atmospheric engines
Th is is because the drive on the piston is provided by the atmosphere working against the partial vacuum created in the cylinder by the condensation of the steam
But there was, and is, a deeper sense in which steam engines were atmospheric engines even when Watt put the steam itself to work in driving the piston
Th e engines were seen as trading on processes that were ubiquitous in the natural world and respon- sible for other atmospheric and geological phenomena
Meteorological and geological understandings were thus important to the science of heat and steam that underpinned the steam engine
Th ose who thought about steam and the steam engine sought, and found, coherences between phenomena in the realm of engines, meteorology and geology
Indeed, I suggest that a steam engine was sometimes thought of as a kind of local corralling of the wild forces of nature
In the twentieth century nuclear physicists sometimes spoke about the act of deploying nuclear forces to provide energy via nuclear reactors as ‘twisting the tail of the dragon
I believe that the same sense of domesticating a wild phenom- enon attended eighteenth-century steam engine technology
Th e steam engine in the eighteenth-century landscape was, not just aesthetically, but also ecologi- cally, part of what went on around it
Watt and De Luc Watt had a longstanding relationship with the Swiss meteorologist Jean André De (1)(2) By the time De Luc began his extended residence in England as Reader to Queen Caroline in 1775 Watt was already familiar with his work, having reported to William Small in 1773 that he had ‘been reading De Luc lately, and I have tried a curious experiment to determine the heats at which water boils at every inch of mercury from vacuo to air
De Lucs observations and mine agree; but his rule is false
Th e point to note here is that De Lucs writings on the atmosphere (in this case his Recherches sur les Modifi cations de lAtmosphere published in 1772) appear to have inspired Watt to conduct particular chemical experiments
More- over, although these experiments were most immediately connected with Watts eff orts to construct barometers, they were also part of his attempts to develop a deeper understanding of the steam engine
Th us, immediately aft er reporting on the repetition of the De Luc experiment, Watt advised: I have some thoughts of writing a book, the ‘Elements of the Th eory of Steam-engines, in which, however, I shall only give the enunciation of the perfect engine
Th is book might do me and the scheme good
And would still leave the world in the dark as to the true construction of the engine
Something of this kind is necessary, as Smeaton is labouring hard at the subject; and if I can make no profi t, I ought not to lose the honour of my experiments
It seems clear from the way that Watt juxtaposed his reading of, and views about, De Luc that he conceived a close relationship between De Lucs chemical mete- orology and his own experiments on steam
Certainly he was to fi nd fault with some of De Lucs ideas and was cautious about ensuring that De Luc did not overlook the credit due to Watts friend and mentor Joseph Black in the dis- covery of ‘latent heat
However, their meteorological and steam engine interests were about atmospheres in a way that was mutually informative
It seems that in 1773 De Lucs writings were one of the factors that turned Watt to the thought of developing and writing his theory of steam-engines
By the time De Luc published his Idées sur la Météorologie in 1787, Watt was not only familiar with the ideas expressed there but had learned about many of them fi rsthand and prior to publication
Watts experiments in the early 1780s, which were so important to his ideas on both steam and the composi- tion of water, were developed in concert with De Lucs work
In fact, when Watt wrote the famous letters to Matthew Boulton and to Joseph Black (discussed in Chapter 4), in which he announced his ideas about the composition of water he had been working directly with De Luc in the laboratory on steam, heat and evaporation
As we have seen, Watts paper on the composition of water in the Philosophical Transactions in 1784 took the form of a letter to De Luc, and, of course, De Luc was the one who urged Watt to assert his rights in the contro- versy with (1)(2)
De Luc was in Birmingham in October 1782 and visited Soho in the com- pany of Baron (1)(2)7 Watt showed the visitors around and was impressed by De Luc as ‘a modest ingeneous man
Th is was probably their fi rst meeting
It was either on that occasion or on a return visit on 9 November that De Luc told Watt about his plans to write ‘some thing on heat and on the nature of elastic fl uids
Watt reported that during the November visit De Luc came for breakfast and ‘spent the whole forenoon incensing himself with steam & steam Engines
De Luc was anxious to learn about Watts experiments, and Watt was forthcoming to some extent
Th e diffi  culty was that he could not explain his own work with- out referring to Blacks on latent heat and he wanted to obtain the professors permission before he gave too much information to De (1)(2)10 It was at this junc- ture that Watt conveyed his idea about the composition of water to Matthew (1)(2) Th is, it will be recalled, involved the idea that water was converted into air if heated enough
For Watt this also had meteorological import – ‘here is a plain account of where atmospheric air comes from, he suggested to (1)(2)
Aft er the late 1782 visit, De Luc was due to return to Birmingham, and it appears that he did return in March 1783, staying with (1)(2)12 According to Watt, during that visit he and De Luc were ‘principally employed in experiments of the latent heat in vacuo, but from the many causes of inaccuracy could come to no other conclusion than that at least the sum of the latent or sensible heat is always equal, that is that the latent heat encreases [sic] as the sensible heat decreases and in some experiments the sum of the heats appeared to be greater in Vacuo than in the Air
De Luc was at Watts house again in late September
conducting further experiments
So Watts engine work and De Lucs meteorology certainly had plenty of opportunity to intersect
In fact, substantially similar chemical ideas were deployed in each domain
Th is intersection is apparent retrospectively in De Lucs Idées sur la Météorologie
A centrepiece of the Idées was De Lucs critique of the solution theory of evaporation as put forward by Senebier, Franklin, Hut- ton and others
According to that theory, water vapour was produced – that is, evaporation occurred – by the dissolution of water in air in a way precisely analogous to the dissolution of salt in water
Th is theory faced the diffi  culty that evaporation occurred in vacuo
De Lucs alternative theory was that water vapour was in fact a chemical product of water and heat
In recounting how he became confi dent of that alternative theory De Luc gave a prominent place to Watts steam experiments
In the Idées De Luc noted how Watt applied and extended the ideas of Joseph Black on latent heat
Watt applied them to the steam engine ‘where the vapours of boiling water played such a large part
Watt had ‘already surmised that these machines were very far from producing the amount of eff ect of which their cause was capable and, De Luc stated, ‘he [Watt] attributed that defi ciency to lack of knowledge about the nature of the active agent
De Luc also recalled how Watt kindly repeated his experiments for him [De Luc], and the Swiss reported in detail those of Watts experiments ‘which helped me most directly to demon- strate that the latent heat of vapours cannot be explained except by a chemical union of particles of fi re and those of water
So De Luc stated that Watts steam experiments provided him with the key evidence for the central proposition of his meteorological work
In tracing connections between steam engines and meteorology, it is also worth noting that De Luc, who was perhaps overly fond of analogies, invoked images of boilers in his discussions of clouds
Having argued that the appearance and disappearance of clouds was independent of the hydroscopic state of the air (and therefore not just a matter of solution and precipitation), De Luc went on: Observing these metamorphoses of one and the same cloud, nothing represents them more exactly for me than the idea of an invisible boiler suspended in the air, with water boiling violently in it
Th is image is too perfect a symbol of what is then observed for there not to be some analogy in the causes; that is to say, some metamor- phosis of substance
Ultimately, De Lucs great ‘discovery was that evaporated water, which, if it accu- mulated in long periods of fi ne weather could not possibly all conceal itself in the upper atmosphere, ‘hides itself in the atmosphere under the appearance of some gaseous fl uid [fl uide aëriforme]; for this is the only way in which it can escape its pressure, growing upon it as it accumulates, and the great diff erences of tem- perature to which it is subjected
Having thus been hidden, the gaseous fl uid is on occasion converted back into its watery form as vapour, becoming once again available to form clouds and rain
Th us the interconversion of air and water was the basis of De Lucs theory of rain and that interconversion itself depended upon the composition and decomposition of water particles and fi re particles
Th e interconversion of air and water gained credibility when De Luc learned of the formation of water by the sparking of infl ammable air in dephlogisticated air
De Luc recalled: ‘the idea of water in any aërial form whatever was to me what a meeting of sea birds would be to sailors who have lost their compass and are searching blindly for the shore
We must remember that many regarded the various airs that had recently been discovered as diff erent varieties of the one, common, air, so that any gaseous product of water would be regarded as ‘air and would establish the interconvertibility of the two
We have already seen
that Watt used De Lucs concept of ‘humor in his 1784 Philosophical Transac- tions paper on the nature of water
Th at concept too underscored the idea that water and air were extremes on a chemical spectrum
Both Watt and De Luc were eager to deal with the various ‘forms of water, including air, as variants upon the ‘humor principle
Even more exciting, for both De Luc and for Watt, at least initially, was Priest- leys announcement in 1783 of his conversion of water into air in an earthenware retort merely by heating
We have seen that this encouraged Watt to put forward his long-gestating theory of the composition of water, and confi rmed De Luc in his theory of water vapour and rain
When Priestley subsequently reported that his experiment had been in error, both Watt and De Luc denied that this reversal put their theories in danger
Watt had merely denied that it demolished his theory
De Luc refused to believe Priestleys retraction
Once again it must be recalled that Watt and De Luc were working very closely at this point, the one concerned primarily with his water and steam-engine work, the other with his meteorology
Just how closely Watt and De Luc converged in treating steam engines and meteorological processes as physically related remains unclear
Th eodore Feldman, having examined their work and found it conceptu- ally related up to a point, concluded, however, that ‘Watt was experimenting with and for steam engines
He did not put his work in a meteorological context
Feldman argues that Watt in fact believed in the solution theory of evaporation so far as evaporation at normal temperatures was concerned
But Feldman grounds this claim on views apparently consistent with the solution theory of evaporation that Watt expressed in letters written in 1779 and 1780
Th ese letters were writ- ten before Watts personal encounters with De Luc, which clearly much impressed him
In late 1783 Watt wrote to Gilbert Hamilton: Mr De Luc is here now, he is busy writing a dissertation on spontaneous evaporation, which he contends is not caused by a solution in air but by Latent heat, in the same manner as vapour is produced by boiling water
I am giving him all the assistance in this subject I can, and he makes frequent and honourable mention of me in the work which is of consequence as it is to be published at (1)(2)
Although divining Watts meaning here is diffi  cult in some respects,22 this passage does suggest that he was not confi dent enough, or eager, to fl atly reject De Lucs account of evaporation, at least in late 1783
It is possible, indeed, that at that time Watt agreed with De (1)(2) At the very least he was not worried about having his name and reputation associated with De Lucs ideas or about being seen as his collaborator
He was clearly fl attered by it, and enjoying the prospect
It may well be that at this point he was prepared to accept De Lucs intended extension of the imperium of the chemistry of latent heat
What is certain is that for both of them a chemical theory of heat held the key
De Luc affi  rmed the chemical nature of meteorology when he envisaged the atmosphere as ‘a chemical labora- tory, as important as the bowels of the earth for the physical phenomena of our globe
Mention of the ‘bowels of the earth points us to another aspect of the ‘cosmology underwritten by the chemistry of heat that framed Watts work
Watt, Hutton and ‘Geology It is worth considering briefl y the role of the chemistry of heat in the develop- ment of geology during this same period, especially its role in the geology of Watts friend James (1)(2) Here too the steam engine and geological processes were analogically and conceptually interlinked in revealing ways
Also, as we saw in Chapter 4, it has been shown by Patsy Gerstner and Arthur Donovan that Huttons ideas were subsequently ‘cleaned up by his followers in order to make them more acceptable in the rapidly changing natural philosophical landscape of the early nineteenth century
My claim is analogous: that a very similar thing happened to James Watts ideas about steam and the steam engine in a way that eff ectively disguised their origins in the chemistry of steam
Huttons theory of heat was very important to his theory of the Earth but was given little prominence in the accounts of Huttons theory developed by his followers, notably John Playfair and Sir James Hall,24 who reinterpreted and reshaped it
For them the chemical theory of heat was an excisable irrelevance, a diversion from the centrally important features of Huttons theory of the (1)(2)
Hutton used the ideas of latent and specifi c heats, which were respectively the principles of fl uidity and volume, as parts of the ‘repulsive force or what he called the ‘solar substance
Together with light and electricity, specifi c heat and volume made up the repulsive force
Hutton explained the dynamics of natural cycles of rock formations largely in these terms within his theory, and so Hut- tons theory of the Earth was given its dynamics by the chemical theory of heat
We have seen how De Luc pursued analogies between meteorological proc- esses and those in the steam engine, and we will see below that Erasmus Darwin did the same in various of his writings
Hutton was also inclined to these analog- ical transpositions with regard to his theory of the (1)(2) A number of historians of geology have observed that Hutton was much impressed by the new steam engines which, with their complex, large-scale movements driven by a single source of heat, may well have been one of the inspirations for his theory of a heat-driven earth machine
If this was the case then the steam engine was eff ec- tively treated as a microcosm of the earth-machine
Th ese ideas were certainly prevalent in more popular accounts of the steam engine in the late eighteenth and very early nineteenth centuries
Th us the entry in Public Characters for Mat- thew Boulton, when giving an account of the steam engine, states: ‘Th us we “put a hook in the nose of the leviathan”; thus we “play with him as a child and take him as a servant for ever”; thus “we subdue nature, and derive aid and comfort from the elements of earthquakes”
When we trace the relations of Hutton and Watt we fi nd that they had a close association for many years
When they met is unclear, but it was sometime before 1772 and probably through their mutual friend, and common chemi- cal mentor, Joseph (1)(2)28 Th ere were plans at one stage for the three of them to travel together on the occasion of Watts historic removal to Birmingham in 1774, but in the event only Hutton left  with Watt on 17 May that year
Th ey arrived in Birmingham on 31 (1)(2) Watt and Hutton visited the Cheshire salt mines either during that journey or shortly aft er their arrival in Birmingham and in those mines Hutton made observations later to be important in his Th eory of the (1)(2)29 It seems possible that this period of close association and work together cemented what was to be a long, if physically distant, friendship
Th eir subsequent surviving correspondence is scanty but intimate
In his more regu- lar correspondence with Black, Watt constantly referred to, inquired aft er, and asked to be remembered to, his friend (1)(2) (1)(2)
In Birmingham and its environs Hutton met other members of the Lunar Society, including Matthew Boulton and Erasmus (1)(2) On a visit to the latter in Lichfi eld, Hutton used Darwins house as a base for expeditions into Derbyshire and also participated in an experiment with an airgun and thermom- eter to demonstrate how the expansion of air cools it
Darwin was later to make use of this fact in explaining processes of ‘devaporation in clouds and in steam engines, as we will see in a moment
At the time of their journey together Hutton and Watt must have discussed pretty thoroughly their respective preoccupations
We know from Watts corre- spondence, as already noted, that he had recently been conducting experiments on the boiling of water at various pressures, partly inspired by De Lucs work
Given that Hutton was already preoccupied with the role of fi re in the formation of the rocks of the Earth, and the behaviour of materials, including aeriform fl u- ids, at high pressures, it seems likely that the similarities between their respective inquiries would have been discussed
Hutton was to rely on ideas about the way in which extreme heat and high pressure brought about departures from normal chemical action
For example, he explained the non-caustic character of calcare- ous earths – a property urged by some as evidence against Huttons theory of heat as the primary agent – by the fact that high pressure had prevented heat from driving out the fi xed air as it did under normal laboratory conditions
Watt, as we have seen, developed the idea that extreme heat would convert water into air, not just into vapour
A number of historians of geology have been persuaded that Huttons expo- sure to Watts steam engines probably provided Hutton with the idea of the Earth as a machine, which is a recurrent analogy in his theory of the (1)(2) Playfairs biography of Hutton noted the admiration that he expressed for Watts engine,
and this observation has since been supported by other writers
Gordon Davies speculated that Hutton may have witnessed Watts fi rst full-scale experiments with the steam engine in 1769 at Kinneil House, the home of Watts fi rst patron John Roebuck, which was not far from (1)(2) We know that Hutton vis- ited Kinneil because he refers in the Th eory to a bed of oyster shells seen there
Th is observation could have been at the same time as he witnessed Watts experi- ments
It is even more likely that Hutton saw the Kinneil engine when it was re-erected in Birmingham for his fellow traveller Watt in 1774
Huttons ‘Earth-machine might in theory have been inspired by any of the machines of the Industrial Revolution, but it is surely no coincidence that he regarded the Earth as a kind of heat engine, which brings the analogy closer
Whether the analogy was even closer still depends on whether Hutton can be reasonably attributed with the idea that the burning of coal was the source of the Earths subterranean heat – an issue that divides historians of geology
But even if coal was not the fuel of the heat machine, the analogy remains strong
As Gordon Davies notes, ‘the active agents in Watts engine and the Huttonian theory are identical – fi re and water: Hutton himself observed that his theory is ‘a system in which the subterranean power of fi re, or heat, co-operates with the action of water upon the surface of the Earth…
He perhaps saw the elevation of new continents by subterranean heat, and the lower- ing of the older continents by atmospheric agencies, as in some way analogous to the rise and fall of the piston in one of Watts early single-acting pumping engines
If De Luc liked to think of steam boilers in the clouds, perhaps Hutton had pis- tons deep within the Earth
As Davies also notes, the Earth/heat-engine analogy is reinforced by Huttons treatment of volcanoes as a kind of safety valve
Hutton put it this way: A volcano is not made on purpose to frighten superstitious people into fi ts of piety and devotion, nor to overwhelm devoted cities with destruction; a volcano should be considered as a spiracle to the subterranean furnace, in order to prevent the unneces- sary elevation of land, and fatal eff ects of earthquakes
Hutton, by using the idea of a safety-valve in this way, deepens the analogy between the Earth-machine and the steam engine and reinforces our belief that thinking about steam engines and about the Earth had a great deal to do with each other for both Hutton and (1)(2) If I am right in treating Watts steam engine as a chemical and mechanical device then it certainly squares well with Huttons vision of ‘this earth as a machine, constructed upon chemical as well as mechani- cal principles, by which its diff erent parts are all adapted, in form, in quality, and in quantity to a certain end…
Th ere is some evidence that geological questions were likely to spring to Watts mind when he conducted steam experiments and experiments on airs
Th is was certainly true in the early days of his collaboration with (1)(2)
Indeed, understanding Priestleys and Watts chemistry involves appreciating the ‘connectedness that they saw and assumed between phenomena that we have divided and demarcated
Our own later maps of knowledge impel us to subsume every move that Priestley made under controversies about ‘oxygen, ‘phlogiston and the ‘composition of water
Th is is a mistake
Robert Schofi eld long ago pointed out the danger of seeing Priestley as reactive (to Lavoisier and the theory of oxidation) when he was pursuing his own positive programmes of research: It is not immediately obvious … that his opposition to the theory of oxidation was a compulsive reaction which was to dominate Priestleys research until his death
Indeed the fi rst set of experiments [undertaken in Birmingham] seems wholly unre- lated to that controversy…the immediate motive appears to have been the geological interests of his fellow members of the Lunar (1)(2)
Priestley published on this work in a note prefi xed to a paper by William Withering in the Philosophical Transactions in 1782
Priestley was examining the extraction of air from various rocks and minerals, a line of inquiry that he reported on more fully in Experiments and Observations in 1786
Th e quantity of air released on heating was taken to be an indication of the mode of formation of the rock
Priestley argued, for example, that basalt and granite when heated produced too much air to be the product of volcanic action
Th ese experiments bore directly on the issues at stake between ‘plutonists who regarded fi re as the primary geological agent and ‘neptunists who stressed the importance of water
Schofi eld detects important continuities between these experiments and Priestleys earlier and later ones
All of them related to the natural economy of air – how air was produced in the fi rst place, and its consumption, production and revitalization through various processes
Th us, in one of his fi rst important chemical papers Priestley wrote: Considering this amazing consumption of air, by fi res of all kinds, volcanos &c
it becomes a great object of philosophical inquiry, to ascertain what change is made in the constitution of the air by fl ame, and to discover what provision there is in nature for remedying the injury which the atmosphere receives by this means
When, in the early 1780s, Priestley experimented on the extraction of air from substances of volcanic origin he was still concerned to gain insights into the consumption of air by volcanoes
And when, in what are usually seen as key documents in the water controversy, Priestley heated water in contact with cal- careous substances and claimed to produce air from water, he was completing the circle by showing how atmospheric air may have been produced in the fi rst place from water, and how natural processes might remedy its consumption
Th e experiments of John Warltire sparking mixtures of infl ammable and ordinary airs to produce water promised further insights into the same natural economy
Watt shared the broad outline and many of the details of this coherent con- ception of the chemistry of airs
Watts long-held belief about the conversion of water into air if high enough temperatures could be attained had meteorological signifi cance
Recall that when he advised Boulton of this idea in December
he noted that it solved the problem of the source of atmospheric air, as Priestley had already observed
Th e work that Priestley did for Boulton and Watt to explore the possibili- ties of using other airs for engines was also conceptually linked to this natural economy
Boulton and Watt were alert to the possibilities of using the capability of fl uids, or even solids, to release and reabsorb air to produce a vacuum and derive mechanical force thereby
In the letter in which he explained to Watt that he was setting Priestley to work on the question, Boulton gave details of what had impelled him to do so
One circumstance had been seeing in London ‘a Glass Vessell fi lld w[i]th >  air which became as instantaneously condensed when brought into contact with  as steam w[oul]d have been, & the same thing happens with ^ air…
Boulton explained further, with accompanying diagram (see Figure 5
) Now if you take a Glass tube hermetically seald at A & open at B – let the space between C & D be fi lld with mercury & the space between D&A be fi lled w[i]th water into which project as much ^ air or >  air as will saturate that  …  Th e moment you apply heat to the water, it gives out the air & ye instant you cool it that instant it is absorbed again by ye
Heat it again & it gives out air so as to raise the mercury to a consid- erable height…
Besides seeing the London experiment, Boulton had also been stimulated by a conversation with ‘Simcox45 who ‘mentioned to me the Idea of detaching fi x- able air from chalk & then in an instant reabsorbing it
Boulton reported being alarmed by this prospect until he was convinced of the ‘impracticability of it
He remained convinced, however, that what could not be accomplished with solids might be with fl uids, and argued that they should take out a patent against the eventuality: Figure 5
Diagram from Boulton to Watt, 21 July 1781
(Archives of Soho, MS3147/3/5, by Kind Permission Birmingham City Archives) a patent for making Engines by means of alternately emiting & reabsorbing all & severaly the diff erent airs, Gasses, permanently elastic fl uids, or by what soever other name they might be calld, seting forth that whereas there are several substances that do contain or are capable of containing several sorts of air acids &c in a fi xed or solid state & that such airs &c are readily detached from, or are emitted by such substances upon being heated & again upon being coold are readily reabsorbed by the s[ai]d substance & thereby a vacuum may be obtained & Mechanical force derived
In the case of the emission and reabsorption of airs by solid substances the links to geological processes are clear
While Watts reply calmed Boulton down, convincing him that such schemes, whether using solids or fl uids, were imprac- ticable, the fact that they could be contemplated at all confi rms the existence in Watts circle of the connections I am claiming between thinking about engines, about the chemistry of airs, geology and meteorology
Another example, this time of the perceived connection between steam experiments and geology, comes twenty years later, when, in retirement, Watt repeated many of his steam experiments, much of the actual work being done by his assistant, John (1)(2) Th e papers dealing with Southerns calculations of the elasticity of steam dating from 1803 contain an interesting document anno- tated ‘Considerations upon the power of steam to produce Earthquakes by Mr Southern 1803
Th is is worth considering in a little detail
Th e ‘Considerations begins with an attempt by Southern (one of many in these papers) to establish the series that elasticities of steam follow
It is recorded that ‘(1) (1) found that the specifi c gravity of steam of atmospheric elasticity was 2000 … times lighter than water
[S]upposing then that if its elasticity is increased its requisite density increases in the same ratio, it would be when equal to
atmospheres as dense as water
Th e question is then asked, what temperature would give this
Th e calculation results in an answer of ‘1107 of Farenheit [sic]
It then becomes apparent that this work is preparatory to dealing with a question about the Earth – whether ‘the powers of steam can be ‘contemplated with the view to their suffi  cientcy [sic] to produce Earthquakes, Volcanoes &c
Th e answer provided is that saturated steam could never achieve the elasticities to do this, but that unsaturated steam might: ‘though one may not look for saturated steam denser than water perhaps & consequently only of the elasticity just mentioned[,] unsaturated steam may be adequate to these eff ects
Th e chain of reasoning arrives at the proposition that a cubic mile of water raised to a temperature of 5100º within a cavity in the Earth of 32 cubic miles would ‘fi ll the … cavity with steam that would press on the whole of the surface with a force of 400 miles perpendicu- lar of water
Th is might I think produce earthquakes and volcanoes
Neither the detailed merits of this analysis, nor where it might fi t in the geo- logical controversies of the time, need detain us here
Th e key point is Southerns and Watts belief that the characteristics of steam (that is the chemistry of water and heat) were relevant to the solution of the problems of both the steam engine and the Earth-machine
Knowing this, the article ‘Steam by John Robison in the third edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica begins to look less eccentric than it otherwise might
When Robison segued from a sober discussion of the boiling of water in a kettle into rhapsodies on earthquakes and other geologi- cal phenomena49 he was in fact refl ecting a natural philosophical worldview still common among his circle and likely shared by Watt himself
Steam in Th e Botanic Garden and ‘Sentimental Empiricism Another member of the Lunar Society, Erasmus Darwin, took an abiding interest in the steam engine, an interest at once visionary, poetic and scientifi c
We fi nd in sources produced by and linked to him, further confi rmation of the chemical nature of the invention as seen by Boulton and Watts contemporaries and also of its close association with meteorological ideas and understandings
Even before Watt came on the scene Darwin and Boulton were discuss- ing steam engines
As the story goes, Boultons worries about the possible lack of water power to sustain his manufactory led him to serious investigation of steam engines from the mid-1760s
He pursued his own steam project until he met Watt in 1768
Writing to Boulton in December 1765, Darwin expressed curiosity about how Boultons steam engine had been received by Dr Franklin and what Franklins observations on it had been
Darwin, Boulton and Dr Wil- liam Small had been discussing boilers and their optimal design
Th is question involved them in considering the phenomenon of evaporation
Darwin wanted to know ‘your fi nal opinion and Dr Smalls on the important Question, whether Evaporation is as the Surface of boiling Water, or not
– or if it be as the Surface of the Vessel, exposed to the Fire, which I rather suspect
He continued: For if you boil Water in a Florence-Flask, you see bubbles arising from the Bottom, these are Steam, as they mount they are condensed again by the cold supernatant Fluid, and their Sides clapping together make that Noise called Simmerring(1)dly When Water boils in the Æolipile or closed Tea-Kettle, what a Quantity of Steam
– is this only as the upper Surface
I humbly conceive not – but as that Surface in contact with the (1)(2)
Th is question of where the boiling took place was crucial to the design of the boiler of the steam engine
Darwin sought from Boulton his, and Smalls, view on ‘the best way of constructing the Boiler for the above Purposes
Th e question of which variable related to the quantity of steam produced was also of theoretical signifi cance
Darwin was interested in what Franklin thought because Frank- lin subscribed to the solution theory of evaporation
Solution theory would be compatible with the proportionality of quantity of steam to surface area of the water to be boiled; solution, in any case, requiring solvent (air) and solute (water) to be in contact
Th e quantity of steam produced being proportional to the surface area of the boiler in contact with the fi re would be consistent with the idea that steam is compounded from water and heat, or the matter of fi re, since this could occur, and did on that theory occur, without contact with the air
At about the same time, but apparently independently, Watt was also considering ‘boyler design in much the same light
Over twenty years later Darwins interest in evaporation and ‘devaporation persisted
In his celebrated paper on ‘frigorifi c experiments published in the Philosophical Transactions53 he drew close analogies between what goes on in the steam engine and in meteorological processes
Darwins central concern in this paper was to show that many meteorological phenomena could be accounted for by applying a basic insight to the issue of movements of air in the atmos- phere
Th at basic insight was that elastic fl uids, when mechanically expanded, withdraw heat from their surroundings
In considering the application of this to the ‘devaporation of aerial Moisture Darwin suggested that when the barom- eter drops, for whatever reason, the lower parts of the air become expanded and, in expanding, extract heat from the vapour contained in them
Th e vapour condenses and it is precipitated in showers
But a remarkable and little-noticed eff ect is that ‘the deduction of a small quantity of heat from a cloud or province of vapour, compared with the quantity of heat which was necessary to raise the vapour from water, will devaporate the whole
Darwin explained this as fol- lows: if ‘a small part of a province of vapour is suddenly condensed, a vacuum is formed and the proximate bodies of vapour expand into it
Th us ‘a large area of vapour, perhaps of many miles in circumference, becomes more or less expanded, by this expansion cold is produced, ‘and the whole is devaporated
Th en comes the analogy with the steam engine: Th is very circumstance exactly takes place in the famous steam-engine of (1)(2) WATT and BOULTON; which, from the happy combination of chemical and mechanical power, may justly be esteemed the fi rst machine of human invention
In this excellent machine, aft er the cylinder is fi lled with steam, a communication is opened between this reservoir of steam and a small cell, which is kept cold by surrounding water, and free from air … What then happens
Th e corner of the steam in the cylinder next to this vacuum (with which it now communicates) rushes into it, and the whole steam in the cylinder is thus suddenly expanded and instantly devaporated…
Th us, according to Darwin, the process that enables Watts separate condenser to work is the same as that which operates, for example, at the beginning of thun- derstorms, when ‘a small black cloud at fi rst appears, in a few minutes the whole heaven is covered with condensing vapour
It is worth noting also that in the above quotation Darwin confi rms the perception of the improved steam engine as a chemical device
By referring to it as the ‘fi rst machine of human invention he means, presumably, the fi rst in rank rather than the fi rst in time
Th is pre-emi- nence is awarded because of the machines ‘happy combination of chemical and mechanical power, the latter deriving from, and being used in concert with, the power derived from application of the knowledge of the chemistry of steam
Darwin had taken a long and close interest in Watts steam-engine improve- ments and famously gave the steam engine a place in his poem Th e Botanic Garden: NYMPHS
You erewhile on simmering cauldrons playd, And calld delighted SAVERY to your aid; Bade round the youth explosive STEAM aspire In gathering clouds, and wingd the wave with fi re; Bade with cold streams the quick expansion stop
And sunk the immense of vapour to a drop
– Pressd by the ponderous air the Piston falls Resistless, sliding through its iron walls; Quick moves the balanced beam, of giant-birth, Wields his large limbs, and nodding shakes the earth
Th e fi rst thing to note about this passage is the tenor of the language, at once meteorological, mechanical and animist
Th e immediate notes on the passage recount the history of the steam engine from Savery through Worcester and Newcomen to Watt and (1)(2) Th ey also refer to its applications and future possibilities
As we saw in Chapter 2, material for Additional Note XI on the steam engine was contributed by Boulton and Watt themselves
Th e Note as published contains a version of the ‘Perfect Engine story intermediate between Watts letters of the time describing the invention and the ‘Plain Story that originated in the 1796 patent trials and was one of the two key versions to be propagated in the nineteenth century
More generally in Th e Botanic Garden we can discern Darwins partial assim- ilation of Lavoisian chemistry in developing his economy of nature
Darwin accepts the Lavoisian account of the decomposition and composition of water
He puts the explosive combination of infl ammable air and oxygene (which he still also denominates as dephlogisticated air) to work in various parts of the natural economy, including the upper reaches of the atmosphere, where their sparking he considered likely to produce instant summer rain, and in the forma- tion of fi ssures in the Earth during its early history
However, Darwin also relied heavily on the ‘doctrine of elementary heat, which he identifi ed with Joseph Black and his followers
Darwin stated: A certain quantity of heat seems to be combined with all bodies besides the sensible quantity which gravitates like the electric fl uid amongst them
Th is combined heat or latent heat of (1)(2) Black, when set at liberty by fermentation, infl ammation, crystalliza- tion, freezing, or other chemical attractions producing new combinations, passes as a fl uid element into the surrounding bodies
And by thawing, diff usion of neutral salts in water, melting, and other chemical solutions, a portion of heat is attracted from the bodies in vicinity and enters into or becomes combined with the new solutions
He proff ered as an additional reason for belief in the doctrine his ideas about the absorption or release of heat when air is mechanically expanded or condensed
Darwin, for all he was the most accepting among the Lunar group of Lavoisiers new chemistry still conceived it within what Riskin60 has called a ‘sentimental empiricism, a view of the economy of nature which he still shared, I suggest, with James Hutton and with Watt and his other Lunar Society colleagues, and which was quite alien to the Lavoisian scheme
Although Darwin writes of ‘calorique as matter of heat in a way that assumes it is interchangeable with the doctrine of elementary heat in the Scottish tradition, we must regard this as obfuscating very real diff erences between them
In fact, through his poetry Darwin gave us the most evocative clue to this common quality in his own cosmology and that of Watt, Hutton, De Luc and other members of their circle; this approach pre- vailed over their substantive diff erences on specifi c issues in natural philosophy
It treated the steam engine as a local manifestation of a kind of chemical power that was ubiquitous in the economy of nature
Watts Steam Experiments Now let us look fi nally, and directly, at Watts experiments on steam and how they related to his steam-engine work
A small notebook in the Watt archives, most of it in Watts hand, contains notes about steam experiments, conducted in Figure 5
Page from Watts 1765 Experiments, with Kettle (1)(2) [Reproduced by kind permis- sion of Birmingham City Archives] 1765 or earlier and in the early 1780s
Notes were added in 1814 when Watt returned to these questions
Th ese are the real kettle experiments, which were arguably the inspiration for the myth of the kettle discussed in Chapter 1
On a page headed ‘1765 there begins a long account of Watts fi rst experiments on steam
Watt recalls fi nding that a greater quantity of injection water than expected was required to condense steam in the cylinder of a steam engine
In particular, more water was needed to condense the steam than should have been required to cool the quantity of water in the steam down below boiling point
Watt recalled (see Figure 5
): I took a bent Glass tube & inverted it into the nose of a tea kettle, the other end being immersed in Cold water
I found on making the kettle boil that tho there was only a small increase of the water in the frigeratory that it was become boiling hot
Th is I was surprised at & on telling it to Dr Black & asking him if it was possible that water under the form of steam could contain more heat than it did when water He told me that had long been a tenet of his…
In this experiment, Watt was arriving independently, sometime before 1765, at the fact of the latent heat of condensation of steam
What was the relationship between these experiments and Watts improve- ments in the steam engine
We need to recall what the key improvement of the separate condenser consisted of
In the Newcomen Engine cold water was injected into the cylinder on every stroke, condensing the steam and creating a partial vacuum so that the atmosphere forced the piston down
More steam was injected, and so the cycle continued
Th e idea of latent heat explained the initially surprising amount of cold water needed to condense the steam in the cylinder
However, latent heat was not central to the engine ineffi  ciency to which Watt addressed himself
Th e problem was that during condensation the cylinder itself was cooled by the injection water
Th e injected steam in the next cycle had to reheat the cylinder
Th e repeated reheating of the cylinder consumed a lot of fuel
When Watt recognized this ineffi  ciency, his fi rst idea was to construct the cylinder of wood, or some other material with a lower specifi c heat, and he conducted trials with various materials
Subsequently, Watt came up with the idea of the separate condenser
In this arrangement the cylinder was not repeat- edly cooled and reheated
Th e fuel saving so achieved was enormous and was the technical basis of the fi rm of Boulton & Watts success
Th e relationship between Watts investigations of the properties of steam and his improvements to the steam engine is not straightforward
Watt investigated a number of properties of steam
Following Black, he also conducted experi- ments on the boiling of water at lower pressures
Th is was linked to the creation of ‘back pressure in the cylinder when the injection water boiled as a result of the partial vacuum in the cylinder and the increased temperature produced by release of the latent heat of condensation of the steam
Arthur Donovan points out that Watts study of this ‘back pressure led to the formulation of the prob- lem to which the separate condenser would be a solution
Th is was expressed in terms of the departure of real from perfect engines
As Watt put it: to make a perfect steam-engine, it was necessary that the cylinder should be always as hot as the steam which entered it, and that the steam should be cooled down below 100° in order to exert its full powers
Th e gain by such construction would be dou- ble: – fi rst, no steam would be condensed on entering the cylinder; and secondly the power exerted would be greater as the steam was more cooled
It was at this point that the idea of the separate condenser occurred to (1)(2)
Th is idea depended on yet another property of steam, namely its ‘elasticity as a vapour
Watt realized that this property of elasticity meant that if an evacuated vessel were linked to the main cylinder, steam would rush into it
Once captured, the steam could be condensed by injection water without having to cool the cyl- inder signifi cantly
Here is an appropriate place to discuss Richard Hillss important and infl u- ential reconstruction of Watts route to the separate condenser
Hills presents the concept of the ‘perfect engine as the guiding idea here
His account runs the risk, in my view, of assimilating the concept to proto-thermodynamic physical ideas
I want to argue that for Watt in 1769 preventing the waste of steam, reduc- ing it theoretically to zero, was conceptualized chemically, but fi rst let me set out briefl y what I take to be Hillss argument
Hills begins with the famous story that during the winter of 1763–4 Watt, who was then an instrument maker with a shop at Glasgow University, was asked by Professor Anderson to repair a model of a Newcomen steam engine belong- ing to the natural philosophy class
According to Watts account he was surprised that the boiler on this model could not supply enough steam to keep the engine going
Watt set about studying what had been written about steam engines to try to understand the basic principles of their operation
Hills tells us that by September 1765 Watt used the term ‘perfect engine in a letter to Dr Lind: I have tried my small model of my perfect engine, which hitherto answers expecta- tion, and gives great, I may say greatest, hopes of success (for certainty could not be called hope), in greater model now far advanced; in short, I expect almost totally to prevent waste of steam, and consequently to bring the machine to its ultimatum
Th e standard of perfection in an engine was thus conceptualized by Watt in terms of the degree to which steam was wasted
In a perfect engine, none was
Th e concept gave Watt a standard against which to judge any working engine
So Watt was on the hunt for sources of waste
He knew that in the New- comen engine the cylinder had to be re-heated at each stroke, that is, a large quantity of steam had to enter, and give up its heat to, the cylinder before the latter became hot enough to be fi lled with steam that remained as steam
Th e injection of cold water into the cylinder in order to condense the steam within it and so create a vacuum was responsible for the cooling of the cylinder
Watts experiments convinced him that this was the single largest source of wastage of steam
Hills account beyond this traces Watts inspiration of the separate con- denser, and how that met the basic criteria that a ‘perfect engine demanded
He also discusses other problems with the Newcomen engine and how Watt dealt with those
What are we to make of this account
Watt certainly used the term ‘perfect engine at the time of his work on the improvement of the steam engine
He also deployed it in retrospective accounts, as we saw in Chapter 2, and it became popular among the fi rst generation of historians, including James Patrick (1)(2) But what work does the concept do
Once it establishes the idea of a perfect engine (which is itself little more than the idea that waste is occurring and that in the best sort of engine it would not) the answer has to be ‘not much
Hillss own account of Watts work in tack- ling various sources and aspects of waste does not need to invoke the idea at all, and it does not do so
Th at account is, in fact, all about heat, that is to say, about chemistry in the then contemporary understanding, certainly in Watts understanding
At one stage, in his most recent treatment of the subject, Hills acknowledges this very point: [Watt] … could never know that his concept of the perfect engine was fl awed
He considered that heat was some sort of chemical substance and regarded the engine as working by the pressure of steam
He thought it was essential to keep the cylinder as hot as the incoming steam all the time to avoid condensation and hence loss of pressure
But he could not know that heat is a form of energy which, when it is trans- formed into work and drives machinery, must decrease in temperature with the result that the cylinder must become colder during the working stroke
Th e reason for this dilemma was recognised only in the middle of the nineteenth century with the rise of thermodynamics…
Whilst ostensibly escaping presentism here, Hillss account actually embraces it in the judgement that Watts understanding of the ‘perfect engine concept was ‘fl awed rather than merely diff erent
Watts concept was only ‘fl awed on anach- ronistic criteria
It was precisely the chemical interpretation that distinguished Watts ‘perfect engine concept from that of nineteenth-century thermodynam- ics
Th us even if we grant the centrality of the idea of the ‘perfect engine to Watts reasoning, in order to avoid anachronism we still have to conceive of that perfection in terms of the chemistry of heat
When heat was thought of as a substance involved in the chemical formation of steam, as Watt thought of it, then it was only necessary to supply enough heat in order to achieve perfection
I think that the concept of the ‘perfect engine has been seized upon for its appar- ent summative potential
Th e term evokes ideas clearly or dimly recollected of the ‘ideal engine from physics and thermodynamics
To use the term ‘perfect engine as the organizing principle for an account of Watts steam engine is to conjure up other ideas such as the bulk properties of steam
Logically, given what we now believe about latent heat, namely that it is a non-chemical phenomenon, the conception of the perfect engine was a major inspiration for the separate condenser idea
Watts reasoning did not involve the chemistry of heat directly, and it is tempting to see it as a kind of proto-thermodynamics, given that it seems to deal with the bulk thermal properties of a ‘working substance
But the essence of a working substance in that sense is that it operates as a vehicle of heat transfer and nothing more
Th e theory of the heat engine becomes independent of the working substance
Th is could never be the case for Watt since his conception of the steam engine depended so intimately on the chemical composition of the steam, which varied according to the amount of heat chemically combined with it, that is latent within it
Ben Marsden has the right idea when he warns his readers against importing nineteenth-century concepts into Watts time
Certainly Watt was not trying to maximize ‘energy output or conversion, he was seeking to minimize waste
But the concept of ‘perfect engine is susceptible of similar misunderstandings
Once the meaning of the term has been explained as an engine that does not waste steam it carries no further meaning
As an abstraction, unlike ‘ideal engine, it does no further work since it has no further content
Th e story of Watts perfect engine can stand
As we have seen, Watt did use the term at a crucial juncture to describe to others what he was doing
Th e story is undoubtedly true when that term is understood as Watt and his contemporar- ies might have understood it
It may well be, as Hills suggests, that the term was borrowed from other contemporary areas of technology practice
Perhaps the concept guided Watt to the idea that the central problem was that of the waste of steam
All these suggestions are fi ne and useful
Th e problem arises when Watts ‘perfect engine elides historiographically into notions of ‘ideal engine of the sort that was to become important in the nineteenth century
When that happens we think we have understood Watt, but we have not
Th ere is still work to do
Let us return now to Watts experiments on steam and latent heat
In late February and early March 1781, Watt resumed experiments on latent heat: Th e straight end of a Pipe was fi xed on the Spout of a Tea kettle from which the pipe inclined upwards so that the Bent end was about 2 feet higher than the Spout of the Tea kettle
Th e Tea Kettle was fi lled with Water halfway up the entry of the spout
Th e Lid was fi xed Steam tight with some oat meal dough
Th e pipe from the tea kettle led into a pan containing water
Watt measured the starting heat, and weight, of the water in the pan
Th en steam from the kettle was Figure 5
Watts Tabulation of Experiments on Heat [Reproduced by kind permission of Birmingham City Archives] Figure 5
Watts Expansive Working, from 1782 (1)(2) [From: (1)(1) Muirhead, Th e Origin and Progress of the Mechanical Inventions of James Watt (London, 1854), vol(1), plate viii]
allowed to condense in the pan and the fi nishing heat and weight of the water in the pan were recorded
Th e experiment was repeated a number of times
When he reviewed these experiments, in 1814, Watt tabulated them70 as in Figure 5
It can be seen that Watt calculated the ‘Total, sensible & (1)(2) Heat (Figure 5
, column 7)
In the 1780s, Watt believed that the sum of the latent and sensible heats was a constant
Th is idea is the basis of what was known into the nineteenth century as ‘Watts Law
It was as we have seen, important to Watts thinking about the composition of water in the early 1780s and was also closely related to his exploration of the principle of ‘expansive working of the steam engine, which he explained in a patent taken out in 1782
Expansive working was ultimately about saving steam
It was about the ‘steam economy in the steam engine
Watt observed that he could refrain from injecting steam into the cylinder through- out the cycle
Instead he considered what would happen if the injection of steam ceased one quarter of the way through the expansion stroke
Th e steam would continue to expand at decreasing pressure
Watt worked out what the average pressure would be using such expansive working, and he came up with a fi gure of 0
(where 1 is the pressure when steam is being injected)
Th e average pres- sure using expansive working was more or less halved
But Watt found that the amount of steam used was a quarter of the amount used in normal working
Note that in the diagram representing this taken from the 1782 patent (Fig- ure 5
) Watt describes the line KL as representing ‘the powers of the Steam when the Piston is at their respective places
He is tracing the declining elasticity of the steam and to him this meant the rate at which the combined latent heat in steam was being lost and converted into sensible heat
Th is is where ‘Watts Law comes in
If it holds, then, given a measure of the sensible heat, the amount of latent heat, and therefore the elasticity of the steam can be determined
So, how should we summarize the chemistry of the steam engine
We see that the link between latent heat and Watts improvements was a complex and contingent one
Donald Fleming went too far when he rejected the link entirely because it was not direct
Certainly the innovation of the separate condenser relied for most of its gains in effi  ciency on the fact that the cylinder was not being repeatedly heated and cooled
Th ose gains would be achieved regardless of the existence of latent heat
Nevertheless, the formulation of the problem of back pressure to which the separate condenser was a solution, did owe a lot to Watts understanding of latent heat and to other of his experiments on the properties of steam
Th ose properties were marginal to Watts key initial improvement, but not wholly irrelevant to it
Th ey were not the proximate cause of the key improvement but were certainly part of his overall understanding of what was going on in the engine and a clue to the problem of the waste of steam and high fuel consumption
Th e later development of the idea of expansive working, however, and the pursuit of ‘steam economy, did involve Watt in thinking much more closely about what was happening in the cylinder
Here the composition of the steam in terms of how much latent heat it contained in various circum- stances became crucial
What I wish to emphasize is that throughout all these experiments Watt understood the activity of steam as being a result of its chemical character as a compound of water and heat
Th e elasticity of steam was the basis of the force that it exerted in order to drive the piston and was also the property that allowed the separate condenser to work
Th e degree of elasticity of the steam in the cyl- inder of the engine depended directly on the amount of latent heat combined in the steam
In short, all key aspects of the engines working were the product of steams chemical character
Watt saw the improvement of the engine as a mat- ter of learning more about the chemical changes occurring in the steam so as to be able to take manipulative advantage of them
Th e narrative giving pride of place to Watts concept of the ‘perfect engine is, when properly understood, compatible with this position
But I think it gives hostage to historiographical fortune by encouraging anachronistic analogies with ideal engines and diverting our attention from the chemical understanding of the steam engine that under- lay Watts innovations
– 147 – 6 THE INDICATOR UNDERSTOOD,  OR WHY WATT WAS NOT A PROTO- THERMODYNAMICIST Later nineteenth-century histories of the steam engine were most oft en written by practising engineers and scientists
Th ey exhibited the common tendency of practitioners to write ‘Whig history, that is, to interpret past historical actors and actions in modern terms
Th is genre of literature, then, assimilated Watt to the modern traditions and conceptions of thermodynamics
In its turn this later nineteenth-century literature has left  its mark on modern historical writings
I am concerned in this chapter with two processes of assimilation of Watt to thermodynamics
Th e fi rst involves conceptual assimilation of Watt to mid- nineteenth-century understandings of ‘energy
A typical example of conceptual assimilation is an essay by Keith (1) Laidler, which presents Watt and his engine as practical progenitors of that science
Certainly the steam engine was an important resource for those developing thermodynamic understandings
But to picture Watt and his engine ‘pushing in that direction is problematic
Even sophisticated and nuanced treatments of the issue fall into a similar trap
Th e eminent historian of technology, Donald Cardwell, implicitly placed the work of Black and Watt on heat into a tradition of the ‘physics of heat, a line leading to the ‘Rise of Th ermodynamics
I have already argued that the excellent and detailed account of the origins of Watts key invention by Richard (1) Hills3 is also on dangerous territory when deploying the concept of the ‘perfect engine in telling that history
Although the term does come from Watts own accounts of how he arrived at his invention, and therefore must in some sense be reliable,
what the term meant to Watt is all too easily lost sight of and elided into later visualizations of ideal heat engines that every modern student learns about as the basis of thermodynamics
Th e second process of assimilation involved the steam indicator, a device that, because of its mid-nineteenth-century involvement with thermodynamic theory, was oft en taken as some kind of natural bridge between that theory and Watt, who invented the instrument
As I will show, the rather mysterious, chequered and just plain misunderstood, history of this device encouraged a ‘telescoping of its later and early history
Th at telescoping in its turn facilitated an easy elision between Watts conceptual world and that of the thermodynamicists
Watt, Heat and Energy Th e elisions which concern me here, and which I will reveal in the case of under- standings of the indicator, have a long history
As we saw in Chapter 2, some of them were perpetrated during Watts self-fashioning in the early nineteenth cen- tury and entered the historiography of the Watt camp including the major works by (1) (1) (1)(2) From there, as well as from their own technical literature, the thermodynamicists used them to understand and shape their own history
A particularly concentrated and revealing source is the sequence of Watt Anniver- sary Addresses given at the Greenock Philosophical Society from 1865
Th ere was a long tradition in Greenock of celebrating the anniversary of Watts birth dating back to the dinners and lunches of the Watt Club from the 1820s
Th e formation of the Greenock Philosophical Society in 1861, which absorbed the membership of the Watt Club, placed these aff airs on a more formal basis and involved addresses given by numerous prominent engineers and scientists
Th e occasions, like the Watt Anniversary Dinners long held in Glasgow itself under the auspices of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders of Scotland, were important to, and supported by, the west of Scotland engineering and shipbuild- ing community whose academic centre was the University of (1)(2) Given the stature and importance of that community to the world of engineering in the later nineteenth century, the Watt Anniversary became much more than a local celebration – a fact attested to by the speakers that it attracted
Th e fi rst Watt Anniversary Address was in fact given by none other than James Joule in 1865
Joules treatment of Watts ideas on heat is worth recounting at some length both for our immediate purpose of seeing how the elisions I identify were made by him, and for more general interest, since to my knowledge its content has never been discussed before
Donald Cardwell, in his biography of Joule, noticed the Address and observed that it was a truly rare occasion, being probably the only public lecture that Joule ever gave to an audience other than a small local gathering
Cardwell does not, however, venture into the contents of the (1)(2)
Joule spoke to the Greenock Philosophical Society in the Watt Institution on 19 January 1865, ‘On Some Facts in the Science of Heat Developed Since the Time of Watt
Th e bulk of the lecture was given over to a description of Joules own, already famous, experimental demonstration of the mechanical equivalent of heat and to the work of his friends William Th omson and Macquorn Rankine in devel- oping the science of thermodynamics
But Joule could hardly avoid a historical sketch of developments concerning heat between Watts time and the mid-nine- teenth century
Th e way that he positioned Watt, or failed to position him, in that sketch is revealing
Joule noted the obvious fi rst – that they were assembled to mark the anniversary of the birth of ‘the greatest mechanician that this or any other country has ever produced
Th e term ‘mechanician, especially from the lips of a man famous for determining the mechanical equivalent of heat, seems to place Watt preferentially as a student and exponent of the mechanical side, rather than the heat side, of that equivalence
Joule also observed that the purpose of the lec- ture was to ‘refl ect on some of those facts of physical science which are intimately connected with the discoveries of Watt, and which give a rational explanation of the operation of that wonderful machine which will for all time be associated with his name
Once again, Watt is associated with the engine, but, at this stage at least, only equivocally with the ‘rational explanation of its operation
Joule then launched into an account of the history of ideas about the nature of heat
He ventured that the conception of heat as elemental, held by the Ancients, was vastly improved in the hands of Bacon, Newton and other great men of the seventeenth century who considered heat as ‘a motion among the particles of matter
Th is, together with Newtons announcement, as Joule depicted it, of the principle of the conservation of energy, laid the foundation of the science of heat
Th en, in the eighteenth century, came a retrograde step
Here is Joules account of the nature of that step and the reasons for it: Th e overthrow of Alchemy and the rise of Chemistry, with its defi nite elements and combining proportions, seem, singularly enough, to have caused a retrograde move- ment in the sister science
Still, as more precise ideas began to prevail respecting the individuality of diff erent species of matter, it was natural enough to attempt to estab- lish a material theory of the then called ‘imponderables, more especially as such a theory was found to give a very intelligible explanation of many calorifi c phenomena; such, for instance, as the absorption of heat when a body assumes another form, as, for example, when ice becomes water, or when water becomes steam
Th e thermal laws in connexion with such changes of state were demonstrated by the celebrated Black, and nothing could appear more natural than to suppose with him that the change of condition was owing to the union of the substance with Caloric, which latter, being neutralized by the combination, ceased to act on the senses, and was therefore called ‘latent heat
Th is is the closest that we come in the entire lecture to a treatment of Watts ideas about heat
Although Watts name is not mentioned at this point, his presence in the thought is unmistakable
He was the person for whom ‘nothing could ever appear more natural than to adopt, following Black, the view that changes of state involved the chemical union of substances with caloric
Watt is hereby excused for his views on the nature and role of heat
He was swept up by a whole tradition that had gone astray – the science of imponderables
He followed (1)(2) In any case both Black and Watt transcended this situation
Th ey had the ‘thermal laws, which were disengageable, Joule implied, from the question of the nature of heat
Such a view of the ‘thermal laws was in direct line of descent from the general strategy of Watts self-fashioning in the later years of his life
Th e rest of his history of heat involves Joule paying obeisance to the work of Rumford and Davy, which he regarded as decisive in favour of the mechanical theory of heat
However, ‘frivolous objections led to it being forgotten so that ‘the several naturalists who more recently have recommenced the enquiry have done so quite independently, and on ground of their own selection
Watt disap- pears from the lecture for a while, as Joule recounts his own work and that of Th omson and (1)(2) But, in concluding, Joule says this: I must now close this very imperfect outline of a few of the discoveries which have taken place since the time of that great man whose birth we are now commemorating
I thank you for the opportunity you have given me of discoursing on results which would have been most interesting to Watt, and for which he himself largely prepared the way
And I trust you will permit me also to express my satisfaction at having had it in my power to speak in Scotland of a theory which Scotland was the earliest country to welcome, and which your countrymen have done more than any others to com- plete and extend
So, even as Watts own ideas about heat and the steam engine are quietly acknowl- edged as defl ected from the main line of development, he is also assimilated to that main line
Th is is done by picturing Watt as preparing the way for it (pre- sumably through the application of the ‘thermal laws to the design of the steam engine from which the likes of Rankine has, as it were, reverse engineered the laws of thermodynamics), as being (virtually
) interested in it, and as being part of that company of Scotsmen who had advanced it
Henry Dyers Watt Lecture of 1889 on ‘Th e Steam Engine since the Days of Watt confronted Watts ideas about heat more directly
He did this through a consideration of Watts invention of the separate condenser
Dyer, following and quoting from Watts own corrective account in Robisons A System of Mechanical Philosophy explained that while it would have been possible for Watt to derive his engine improvements from the concept of latent heat, this ‘does not seem to have been the way in which this discovery was developed
In a prior exposition of Blacks doctrine of latent heat, Dyer stated that ‘Black fi rst showed … that heat may enter a body and cause it to change its molecular condition, while the temperature as indicated by the thermometer remains constant, in other words that the heat becomes latent
Th e phrase ‘molecular condition is, of course, a modernization of Blacks actual conception
In fact Dyer goes on to give this rendering of what Black and Watt believed
According to the material theory of heat, he says, it was supposed: that heat was an imponderable, gaseous fl uid, which, entered the pores of bodies, and caused them to expand, and which combined with their substance and became latent or hidden when they pass from the solid into the liquid state, or from the liquid to the vaporous, and which re-appears when the passage is reversed
Although this theory is no longer held, still the name latent is retained, as it expresses clearly enough what actually takes place
Whether through ignorance or design, Dyer here is attributing to Black and Watt a curious combination of a chemical material theory of heat and an Irvin- ist, non-chemical material theory of the sort that became popular in the early nineteenth century
Th is is a good example of the sorts of elisions that converted Watts and Blacks theories of heat into something assimilable to nineteenth-cen- tury physical conceptions
At the end of the historical excursion Dyer makes an interesting and revealing statement that his main reason for taking the reader on it was not to weigh the relative merits of Black and Watt but rather to illustrate the fact that when we study the history of the steam engine we fi nd that the great improvements which have been made in it have not always been the result of an exact appreciation of the full extent of the laws which govern them, but rather of clear-sighted observation of experiments on the part of men gift ed with mechanical genius, who have perceived the direction in which these laws tend…
Dyers solution to the dilemma about what to do with the disjunction between Watts understanding of heat in relation to the steam engine and that given by nineteenth-century physics was to elevate that disjunction to the level of a his- torical generalization about the relationship between theory and practice
Watts accomplishment was the product of his application of clear-sighted experiment and mechanical genius assisted by his perception of the ‘tendency of natural law
We are not far here from Cardwells depiction of Watt as a proto-thermody- namicist, as we see when Dyer precedes his discussion of Carnots work that ‘laid the foundations of the thermodynamical theory of heat engines with the obser- vation that ‘Watt seems to have perceived, if not the law, at least some of the conditions of maximum effi  ciency of steam engines considered as heat engines
Dyer simply assumed that Watt had the modern concept of a ‘heat engine
Similar anachronistic treatments of Watt pervaded more accessible accounts
Th us (1) (1) Forbes in his Preliminary Dissertation to the eighth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, implied Watts knowledge of ‘energy
Discussing the Cornish engines of the early nineteenth century, which achieved effi  ciencies well in advance of Watts own engines, Forbes made two points
First he claimed those engines for Watt in the sense that ‘they do not contain a single contrivance of any importance … which was not the unaided invention of (1)(2) Watt
Th en, immediately, he assimilated Watt and ideas of ‘energy: ‘In the Cornish engine we see the Energy of Heat rendered available to an extent which the inventor himself [Watt] would at one time have thought scarcely credible
Note that what Forbes attributes to Watt here is surprise at the amount of energy made available, not surprise at the very concept of energy itself
By so doing his treat- ment presumes continuity between Watts conceptual world and the world of ‘energy
Th e engineer (1) (1) Ewing, who wrote the new article on Watt for the ninth edition of the Britannica, added his own contribution to this tendency by describing Watt as ‘having had ideas greatly in advance of his age regarding what is now called energy
Watt might not have had the term, Ewing thereby claimed, but he had the idea
All these authors – Cardwell, Joule, Dyer, Forbes and Ewing – were engaged in exploring the terms and conditions on which Watts heat experiments can be assimilated to the main line of development of thermodynamics
Th ey have dif- ferent answers to the question and, we might think, varying degrees of success
But they are all engaged in the same sort of exercise, that is, fi nding a conceptual or procedural reason for attaching Watt to the nineteenth-century energy theo- rists and thermodynamicists via a line of descent
An alternative way of making this attachment, and one that became increasingly popular during the nine- teenth century, was via the indicator and the indicator diagram
Th e indicator – the device that we saw placed in Watts right hand in the commemorative statue placed outside the Watt Memorial Engineering and Nav- igation School in Greenock – played a central role in this process of assimilating Watt to nineteenth-century thermodynamics
For Watt this was a device with which he thought that he could measure directly the state of the steam in a work- ing engine
In fact, the indicator and the diagrams produced by it are not usually seen in that way because, once again, the historical fog created by that greatest of nineteenth-century scientifi c developments, the science of thermodynamics, has partially obscured it
Th e Indicator Diagram and the Transition from Chemistry to ‘Physics Th e origins of the science of thermodynamics (of the relations between heat and motion) as developed by Carnot, Clapeyron, Clausius, Joule, Th omson and Rankine from the 1820s into the 1850s is routinely traced back to the world of the steam engine
Th is is the example, par excellence, of technology-driven sci- entifi c progress, as captured in the famous dictum that ‘science owes more to the steam engine than the steam engine does to science16
Th e ‘indicator diagram is usually treated as a crucial link between Watts steam engine work and the subse- quent development of thermodynamics
Th e indicator diagram is thus regarded as a precursor of the insights of that science
Once again, ‘precursoritis proves an obstacle to understanding
I argue that the indicator diagram, in Watts hands, was not about the physics of heat but rather about diagnosing the chemical char- acteristics of the steam
Pictured in Figure 6
is an example of the mature indicator diagram tech- nology, dating from about 1840
Th e apparatus was attached to the cylinder of a steam engine
A small piston moved a pencil on the chart in accordance with the pressure in the engines main cylinder
Th e chart itself moved laterally in response to the movement of the piston in the main cylinder and so its ‘travel was in proportion to the working volume of the cylinder at any given time in the cycle
In tracing the origins of the science of energy, the indicator diagram is understandably given an important place
Th us Crosbie Smith says of this device, as developed by Watt and John Southern: ‘Th is ‘indicator diagram, the area of which represented the power developed by the engine, allowed for adjust- ment of the engine in order to maximize useful work
Th e indicator diagram, more widely known from the 1820s, would subsequently become, in Rankines terminology, the ‘diagram of energy
For many purposes, this assumption of continuity between the device developed by Southern and Watt and the instru- mental and conceptual world of Rankine is useful and unproblematic
But for our current historical purposes it represents a problem, an obstacle to under- standing Watts conceptual world
We need to take Watt out of this ‘main line of development of energy physics, and to try to see the indicator diagram as he fi rst saw it, not as others subsequently reinterpreted it
Figure 6
Indicator Diagram (1)(2) [Reproduced with permission from Science Museum, London, Science & Society Picture Library] In an important sense the indicator diagram was developed because of a press- ing technical need
When steam engines were pumping water out of mines, or pumping it for use with water wheels, relatively simple calculations of quantities of water raised through measured distances could be used to provide a measure of power
However, once the rotative steam engine was applied to the powering of machinery, the task became more diffi  cult
Barometric-style pressure gauges were used but these could only supply maximum and minimum pressures in the cylinder and thereby an average pressure
Th e indicator diagram, as developed by Watt and Southern, in 1796 was also initially conceived as a way of measur- ing average pressure
But it was subsequently ‘realized that a continuous index of value could be obtained and that the area enclosed by the traced curve was a measure of the power developed by the engine at a given speed (see Figure 6
)
Th is technique was thus an eminently practical one
Th e indicator diagram was something of an ‘underground technology for many years
Although it was used by Boulton & Watts engineers in building and installing steam engines in a number of countries, it was not widely known
Card- well claims that it was a well-guarded secret
An incomplete description of it was given in an article in the Quarterly Journal of Science in 1822
Watts descrip- tion of the indicator, fi nally published in the same year in Brewsters edition of Robisons A System of Mechanical Philosophy, described only the early, non- recording, type of instrument and so left  out altogether some essential parts of the mechanism
Th e British steam expert John Farey apparently did not learn of the indicator until 1819
Some Boulton & Watt men who were erecting a steam engine in Russia had made an indicator, and this came into Fareys possession during a visit to St Petersburg in that year
Farey testifi ed before a Parliamentary Committee on the Patent Laws in 1829 that he had made an indicator on the strength of this and communicated the idea and the process to others, including the author of the paper in the Quarterly Journal of (1)(2) Th is was one, rather roundabout, way that the indicator made its way into the generality of steam- engine practice in (1)(2)21 But there were other channels
Th e article in the Quarterly Journal was dated from Glasgow, 14 February 1822 and signed ‘(1) (1) Jun
Other clues as to the identity of its author include his statement that the indicator was used in ‘our works and was made from a description provided by ‘(1)(2) Field of London
It was also observed that the instruments were now made by ‘(1)(2) Hutton of the Anderston Foundry
On the strength of this information, Dickinson and Jenkins believed that ‘(1) (1) Jun was probably Mr Hutton or his son
However, it seems much more likely that the mysterious author was in fact Henry Houldsworth Jr (1797–1867)
Th e Houldsworth family had founded cotton-spinning companies in Glasgow and Manchester, and the Glasgow branch established the Anderston (1)(2) Henry Jr became a partner sometime in the 1820s in the Manchester cotton-spinning business founded by his uncle, Th omas Houldsworth, but in the early 1820s Henry junior was still based in (1)(2) He was much interested in innovations in machinery, being implicated in the processes of technology transfer in the textile industry, including by industrial espionage, between the United States and Britain at about that time
Later in his career he was to take out a number of patents
He was accused in the 1830s of unjustly exploiting the ingenuity of his workmen
Th ese aspects of his activities suggest a man who would not rest content for Boulton, Watt and (1)(2) to keep the indicator under wraps
Th e Houldsworths were no strangers either to Boulton & Watt engines, or to the indicator
Boulton & Watt steam engines were installed in Houlds- worth family concerns in both Manchester and (1)(2) One of the earliest indicator diagrams preserved in the Boulton & Watt collection was made in March 1803 at Th omas Houldsworths mill in Manchester, the diagram show- ing what gain was made by expansive working and giving information about the valve settings
Correspondence in the Boulton & Watt papers seems to show that various manufacturing operators of steam engines tried to get hold of their own indicators
Whilst the request from Mr Wedgwood to Boulton & Watt for an indicator ‘for his own use that he may try his engine under diff erent parts of the machinery, might have been acceded to, it is unlikely that other requests would
As late as 1835 a request to Watt Jr to borrow an indicator was met with the unhelpful reply that Boulton Watt and (1)(2) did not make indicators for sale and that all their instruments were out being used by their engine erectors
Boulton & Watt employees such as Haden, who erected an engine at Houldsworths in 1807, used the indicator in setting up and tuning engines and so gave their clients a tantalizing view of the possibilities of the device
But it was unlikely that those clients would have been supplied with a device of their own
While all the details are not clear, it does seem likely that the 1822 article in the Quarterly Journal was by Henry Houldsworth Jr and was an outcome of an already longstanding acquaintance of the Houldsworth family with the use of indicators and an equally longstanding frustration of attempts to gain control of one
(1) (1) Juns reference to Mr Field as the source of the description of the indicator that his company built is almost certainly a reference to Joshua Field (1781–1863), one of the founders of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1818, and a long-term partner in Maudsley, Sons and (1)(2) Field was an expert on marine steam engines and in that market he became a competitor of Boulton, Watt and (1)(2) In 1821 Field made a tour of the industrial areas of the Midlands, which included a visit to (1)(2)26 Perhaps on that tour he managed to procure details of the indicator that were passed on to Houldsworth and, reinforcing information from Farey, issued via ‘(1) (1) (1)(2) in the Quarterly (1)(2)
We should note, as the above account shows us, that considerable techni- cal distance, and quiet industrial contention, separated the indicator of

from that of 1840 and beyond
Even before knowledge of the indicator became widespread, however, it does appear that Boulton & Watt engineers produced numerous indicator diagrams in the early decades of the nineteenth century that may have come to others attention
By mid-century the devices themselves and their practical use wherever steam engines were employed were well established
But what is the story of their penetration into the world of engineering science
In 1834 something looking, as an inscription, very much like the indica- tor diagram appeared in a paper published by Benoît-Pierre-Emile Clapeyron in the Journal de lEcole Polytechnique (see Figure 6
)
In the history of ther- modynamics, this paper is regarded as having given eff ective voice for the fi rst time to the key ideas of Sadi Carnot, upon which later fi gures, notably William Th omson and Rankine would build
In Clapeyrons hands the indicator diagram became an abstract representation of the cycle of a heat engine
Th ere is some circumstantial evidence linking Clapeyron to the indicator diagram as used by Boulton & Watt employees
Clapeyron was in Russia in the 1820s and he may have learned about the indicator diagram there from Boulton & Watt engineers working in St (1)(2)28 It was certainly whilst in Russia that Clapeyron learned of Carnots Réfl exions sur la puissance motrice du feu,29 and Clapeyron planned his ‘Mémoire whilst in St (1)(2) Cardwell sees the ‘Mémoire as a crucial bridge between the work of Watt and that of the sophisticated theo- reticians of a later generation
Th ere is no doubt that later theorists, including William Th omson (Lord Kelvin), were very familiar with the practicalities of Watts steam engines and, indeed, with the use of the indicator diagram, in its mature form, to measure ‘power
Although Clapeyron did not mention Watt or the indicator diagram, oth- ers made the link explicitly
In later nineteenth-century texts the connection was routinely made
Here, for example, is Peter Guthrie Tait, the close associate and collaborator of William Th omson: ‘Besides the many capital improvements which Watt introduced into the steam engine … we owe to him what is called the Indicator Diagram, which is of the utmost importance to the elementary exposition of the fundamental principles of Th ermodynamics
Tait was care- ful to point out, however, the nature of Watts understanding of the indicator diagram as giving ‘the work done during a stroke of the engine
It was in the hands of Clapeyron and Rankine that it was developed to represent ‘the thermal properties of the working substance itself; and their connection with the laws of thermodynamics
Th e indicator gained important mention when engineers wrote about (1)(2)
One prominent and important example was the article on Watt written for the ninth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, by (1) (1) (1)(2)32 In this fi rst sub- stantial rewriting of the Britannica article on Watt since 1824, Ewing has this to say of the indicator: One more item in the list of Watts contribution to the development of the steam- engine is too important to be passed without mention: the indicator, which draws a diagram of the relation of the steams pressure to its volume as the stroke proceeds, was fi rst used by Boulton and Watt to measure the work done by their engines, and so to give a basis on which the charges levied from their customers were adjusted
It would be diffi  cult to exaggerate the part which this simple little instrument has played in the evolution of the steam-engine
Th e eminently philosophic notion of an indicator diagram is fundamental in the theory of thermodynamics; the instrument itself is to the steam-engineer what the stethoscope is to the physician, and more, for with it he not only diagnoses the ailments of a faulty machine, whether in one or another of its organs, but gauges its power in health
By describing the indicator diagram as a ‘philosophic notion, Ewing associ- ates Watt with philosophic insight of a thermodynamic kind
Even though he acknowledges the practical purpose of the device for Boulton and Watt, there is no sense that Watts understanding of the device was a radically diff erent one from that within thermodynamics
Not all engineers readily granted the stetho- scope analogy that Ewing accepts here
Rankine, for example, in his Manual of the Steam Engine, makes no use of the analogy since he was determined, in line with his beliefs about the intersection of theory and practice, to analyse scientifi - cally what others might accept as the tacit elements of indicator practice
Why ‘Telescoping the History of the Indicator is a Bad Idea William Henry Preece gave another, particularly interesting, retrospective account of the indicator in his Watt Anniversary lecture of 1897, which was titled ‘Watt and the Measurement of Power
Preece claimed that the indicator was Watts ‘greatest invention because it had been ‘most prolifi c in exciting fur- ther improvements in the steam-engine and because it had supplied the engineer with a ‘new sense
Preece, too, echoed the refrain that the indicator was to the engineer what the stethoscope and thermometer were to the physician because it gave an insight into the internal workings of the engine
Crucially, he was also of the opinion that ‘few instruments have been found to require less modifi cation and that Watts conception and development of it showed that he was ‘a long way before his time in grasping the doctrine of energy
Preece displayed to his audi- ence what he claimed to be Watts ‘original instrument, which he declared to be 112 years old, thus dating it to 1785
He placed this alongside the most recent form of indicator to illustrate their essential similarities and reinforce the point about the virtual completeness of the original device, and thereby support the claim about Watts prescience
Preece linked the origins of Watts indicator to his development of expansive working, and specifi cally to the famous graphical presentation in the 1782 patent
He considered that it was this way of represent- ing what was going on in the cylinder (Preece says ‘the work done in it) that led Watt to the idea of recording those happenings automatically
Preece remarked on Watts prescience, considering him ‘before his time in the use of graphics, and in the conception of the principle of energy and thus associated Watts indicator not only with the concept of ‘work but also that of ‘energy
At another stage, when discussing the ‘grand principle of the conservation of energy, he noted that energy is present in a form either useful or useless to man and that the engi- neers skill is to render useful that which is useless
Watt more than anyone else, he believed, had helped the engineer to do this
Preece had borrowed Watts ‘original instrument from Mr George Tangye of (1)(2) Th e diagram of it given in Preeces printed lecture shows ‘1785 inscribed on the main indicator barrel, hence the claim that the instrument was 112 years old
Comparison of the diagram in Preeces paper with the indicator currently held by the Th inktank in Birmingham (see Figure 6
) shows them to be structurally identical
In fact, a close inspection of that instrument reveals a very faint inscription of ‘1785 upon the barrel
Th is shows with reasonable certainty that it is the actual instrument displayed by (1)(2) Th is is made even more likely when we learn that the instrument in the Th inktank came from Birmingham Central Library, which had acquired it, along with the Boulton Figure 6

So this chain of events would indeed place the ‘Th inktank indicator in Tangyes hands in 1897 when he lent it to Preece to display at the Watt Anniversary Lecture
Th e problem with all this is that the indicator that Preece displayed as Watts ‘original device of 1785 is in fact a later model, dating most likely from the 1820s-1840s
An indicator of this design was certainly not extant in 1785 since the fi rst recording indicator dates from the mid-1790s
Preeces erroneous tel- escoping of the diff erences between nineteenth-century indicators and Watts original instrument acted to support his contentions about Watts theoretical prescience
Revealing the historical problems with Preeces account of the provenance of the instrument, accordingly, renders those contentions problem- atic
More generally, it may well have been the case that there was widespread ignorance about the history of the indicator in the later nineteenth century that, in similar fashion, brought Watts ‘original indicator, and therefore the man himself, closer than was warranted to the indicators known and used by the thermodynamicists
We can grant that there were substantial continuities in a physical sense between the indicator diagram as developed and used by Watt and his associ- ates and those who placed similar inscriptions at the centre of their work on the motive power of heat within thermodynamics
But what was the conception of the working of the steam engine that lay behind the indicator diagram for Watt
Given that the ‘indicator diagram evidently plots the continuous variation of pressure in the cylinder during the engines cycle, it seems natural to assimilate it to later understandings
Although Watts and Southerns understanding of the device was less fully theorized than that of later investigators, surely the same thing was being measured
In fact, the answer to that question has to be ‘no
Th e philosopher Davis Baird has already noted the reason for this
Ulti- mately Baird has a very diff erent purpose from mine for examining the Indicator Diagram, namely to demonstrate the supposed autonomy of the indicator as an instrument across transformations in the theoretical understanding of what it measures: What is crucial is that the Indicator displays a phenomenon irrespective of the the- ories available for understanding that phenomenon
Th is allowed the Indicator to survive the theoretical ignorance of its birth and promote the theoretical advance we now associate with it … Th eories come and go but a new instrumentally-created phenomenon endures
Sometimes such an enduring phenomenon can promote theo- retical progress as well
In pursuit of this account of what he calls ‘Th ing Knowledge (about which I have some serious doubts) Baird does, however, present a rather useful descrip- tion of what he designates (less usefully) as the ‘theoretical ignorance that Watt and Southern brought to the Indicator Diagram, that is, their understanding of what it measured
As we have seen a number of times already, in his articles on ‘Steam and the ‘Steam Engine in the 1797, third, edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Watts close friend John Robison wrote about steam in terms that were still sig- nifi cantly faithful to the original ideas with which Black and Watt had worked
Reading those articles is to see an earlier cosmology preserved as if in amber
Robison depicted steam as a compound of water with latent heat
Writing about a steam bubble formed in boiling water, he stated: Observe, that during its passage up through the water, it is not changed or condensed; for the surrounding water is already so hot that the sensible or uncombined heat in it, is in equilibrio with that in the vapour, and therefore it [the surrounding water] is not disposed to absorb any of that heat which is combined as an ingredient of this vapour, and gives it its elasticity
So the source of the elasticity of steam is the latent heat
It is the elasticity of steam that enables steam to produce motion by moving a piston to expand the space that it occupies
Th us, if it were possible to increase the latent heat contained in the steam then more motive power would be available
Robison discusses how pressure aff ects the boiling point of water and therefore the relative content of latent and sensible heat in the steam produced
Davis Baird notices the signifi - cance of the fact that then Robison discusses, in the Britannica article, a device known as a ‘pulse glass
Th is is an evacuated vessel containing water or some other substance in which the liquid boils and condenses at temperatures very close to room temperature
(Th is phenomenon is the basis for novelty ‘drinking birds and the like)
In the later republication of Robisons article incorporating annotations by Watt himself, Watt made a revealing comment at the point where Robison discussed the pulse glass
Watt inserted a footnote which read: ‘Th e invention of the pulse glass is ascribed to (1)(2) Franklin, its date uncertain, prob- ably subsequent to my improvement of the Steam Engine, at least certainly not known to me at that time
Why does Watt bother to make this statement
As Baird argues, the only reason why Watt would assert that he was ignorant of the pulse glass at the time of his steam-engine improvements would be because he believed that the phenomena that the pulse glass illustrated were relevant to the innovation
Otherwise the denial was unnecessary
Th is strongly suggests that Watt did believe that waters property of boiling at lower temperatures when at lower pressures was relevant
It was because he believed that the relative pro- portions of latent and sensible heat in steam aff ected its elasticity and therefore determined how much motive power the steam could produce in the engine
Watt and Robison understood the Indicator on this basis
It was originally developed in order to track the details of pressure changes in the cylinder, pres- sure changes that they believed aff ected the relative proportions of latent and sensible heat in the steam and therefore its motive power
In another explanatory footnote to Robisons article Watt further described the Indicator as designed to ‘show nearly the degree of exhaustion in the cylinder at all periods
It is impor- tant to register that Watt says nothing here about the use of the indicator to determine the work produced by the engine
Th e focus on the degree of exhaus- tion of the cylinder is symptomatic of Watts concern with the way that pressure aff ected the constitution of the steam, especially the relative amounts of latent and sensible heat within it
It seems likely that over the years Watt had two uses for the indicator, one as an indicator of the elasticity of the steam and the other, later, use as a measure of the work that an engine was performing
Early model indicators in which a pointer simply indicated the pressure of the steam refl ected the earlier use
To see this we need to examine in a little detail the early evolution of the indicator
Th e earliest, and I think so far unnoticed, record of an attempt by Watt to diagnose experimentally the chemical state of the steam inside a ‘working engine is contained in an eyewitness report by Henry (1)(2) In early August
Cavendish and his assistant Charles Blagden visited the Soho works of Boulton & Watt at (1)(2) Th ey were shown Watts latest experiments on the steam engine, and Cavendish recorded the experience: (1)(2) Watt mentioned, that having found that some steam is condensed in the cylinder of the Steam engine, tho surrounded with steam, he made an experiment to discover what happened
He threw steam into a Glass vessel close at the top (By making it communicate with that part of the cylinder of this fi re engine in which there is alter- nately Steam and Vacuum) and found that upon making the Vacuum some of the steam condensed on the sides of the Glass Vessel; and having heated the sides of this Vessel, so that none could condense upon them, he observed the condensation take place, so as to render the Steam visible in the middle of the Glass vessel … a cloud began to appear at each Vacuum…
Th e device described by Cavendish is not an indicator in the sense of recording a value or series of values
It was, rather, a way to inspect directly what was going on in the cylinder as the engine went through its cycle
Using this device made available to the experienced eye a sense of the internal workings of the cylinder whilst the engine was in operation
Had Watt been asked to describe what he saw, the account forthcoming would have been in terms of the variable latent heat of the steam
We might call this very fi rst indicator (if such it is) a ‘visual indicator because of its reliance on direct inspection of the state of the steam in the cylinder
It deserves to be designated as an indicator, I think, because of the objective involved in its use, and also because it embodies the idea of attaching a device to an engine which ‘communicates with the cylinder in order to represent in microcosm, as it were, conditions within it
Th e fi rst devices to use a surrogate signal to substitute for direct viewing of the steam were simple barometers in which the variation of the level of the mercury indicated the pressure
Th is sort of barometer had been used to deter- mine pressure in the condenser, but did not work very well for the cylinder
Watt later stated that ‘Th e barometer being adapted only to ascertain the degree of exhaustion in the condenser where its variations were small, the vibrations of the mercury rendered it very diffi  cult, if not impracticable, to ascertain the state of exhaustion of the cylinder at the diff erent periods of the stroke of the engine
Th e device usually identifi ed as the fi rst indicator was a pressure gauge attached to the engine cylinder
It consisted of a small cylinder containing a piston con- trolled by a spiral spring
In this instrument, a pointer was attached to the rod of the piston and indicated on a fi xed scale the variation of the pressure in the cylinder
By observing at the same time a reciprocating part of the engine, and noting the pressures, a measure of pressure in the engine at various points in the cycle could be obtained
Examples survive of a modifi cation of this instrument in which a long pointer was attached to the piston rod via a lever (See Figure 6
)
Th is was the instrument used for the very fi rst attempts to measure the per- formance of a working steam engine, at the Salford Cotton Mill of George Lee, beginning possibly as early as December 1793
Only at this juncture, in 1796, was the next design of the indicator – the recording indicator – developed, on the initiative of Watts assistant John (1)(2) Th is is the design with the sliding platen, and the pencil attached to the piston arm of the indicator, a design that became familiar and widespread from the 1830s
(See again Figure 6
) Th is is the instrument that produces the ‘indicator diagram and the instrument that Preece was misled into putting in Watts hands in 1785
In truth, in 1785 the visual indicator was all that Watt had
It was to require a decade of development before the recording indicator became available
Only at that stage did it become possible to conceptualize the area of the indicator diagram as a measure of the power of an engine or, more particularly, of the work done by it
Of course, that it was possible to do this at that stage does not in itself mean that it was done
By means of his early indicators (the ‘barometer, the early gauge devices, and those producing early versions of the indicator diagram), Watt was, I suggest, pursuing a ‘steam economy by trying to gauge the state of the steam
Th is would provide information, for example, about how much cold water to inject into the cylinder
Also, as Robison put it: By knowing the internal state of the cylinder in machines of very diff erent goodness, we learn the connection between that state of the steam and the performance of the machine; and it is very possible that the result of a full examination may be, that in situations where fuel is expensive, it may be proper to employ a weak steam which will expend less fuel, although less work is performed by it
Th us, although a semi-abstract identifi cation of the indicator diagram with the work performed by an engine was beginning to be made at this stage, this was still part of the practical discipline of designing and adjusting engines so as to achieve the optimum steam economy
In that sense it was closer conceptually to Watts initial attempts to diagnose by literally seeing inside the engine than it was to the nineteenth-century indicator diagram of thermodynamic principle
Indeed Richard Hills notes this in his discussion of the detailed adjustments to Th omas Houldsworths machine in 1803 using indicator diagrams: this indicator diagram shows that, with the fi nal setting of the valves, there was little expansion of the steam during the working stroke and a high terminal pressure so no fall in temperature at the end
Th is points to the engine being regarded as working by pressure and not the transformation of heat
Once again we see that for Watt at this time, still, heat was what, by chemi- cal means, gave elasticity to the steam and created the pressure that worked the engine
Th ere was no mechanical equivalent of heat here
Th e most determined modern argument that a conception of the heat engine did develop within the Watt circle was mounted by Arnold Pacey in 1974
He tried to show, as he put it, that elements of the heat engine concept ‘were present Figure 6
Th e Pointer Indicator or Pressure (1)(2) [Reproduced from (1) (1) Dickinson and (1)
Jenkins, James Watt and the Steam Engine (1927), p
] as ideas before the time of Carnot, and not only as inventions
Th e key heat engine concept that Pacey claims to fi nd is the idea that there is a fl ow of heat through the engine
Indeed, in company with Cardwell, he believes that Watts invention of the separate condenser ‘clarifi ed the idea of the fl ow of heat through the engine as an essential feature of its operation
He relies upon a close examina- tion of experiments with the indicator by the aforementioned George Lee upon his steam engine in the works of Philips and Lee at Salford, near Manchester in 1793–5 to argue that this fl ow of heat was ‘explicitly recognized by friends and associates of (1)(2)
Th is claim is built upon an interpretation of what Lee was doing in four out of a total of fi ft y-four experiments that were reported to Boulton & Watt in 1796
In those four experiments Lee ‘calculated the quantity of heat supplied to the engine and compared it with the quantity of heat given up at the con- denser
Th e quantities were found to be substantially the same, but Lee would have expected this
As Pacey states, Lee was not testing the conservation of heat but assumed it
His object in making the comparison of output and input was simply to check on the accuracy of the temperature readings
So why all the fuss
What did Lee think of all this
On the basis of evidence that he admits to be fragmentary, Pacey tries to argue that Lee saw heat fl owing through the engine and related its fl ow to the power of the engine: Conservation of heat was probably the central principle in Lees thought (as it still was for Carnot), but Lee must also have had some ideas about how heat gave rise to mechanical power
Indeed, many of his experiments seemed to indicate that the work done was proportional to the quantity of heat given up at the condenser
But why must he have had such ideas
Th ere is no evidence that he did except in the modernizing gloss that Pacey puts upon Lees fi gures by translating the pres- entation of those fi gures from, as he puts it, Lees ‘cumbersome form of words into formulae that Lee did not in fact employ
Th at Lee measured inputs and outputs of heat says nothing in itself about how he conceived of what was going on in between
Indeed, as Pacey acknowledges ‘Lee did not actually calculate power or work, but rather the “eff ective pressure”, that is the pressure diff erence across the piston
I contend that Lee did this precisely because his idea of how the engine worked had nothing to do with the conversion of heat into mechani- cal power in the modern sense
Rather, like Watt, he probably conceived of heat combining with water to give elasticity to the steam and so create pressure on the piston
Hills, as we saw above, makes exactly this point about the concep- tions guiding the indicator experiments at Houldworths Mill in 1803, when he concludes that the experiments betrayed the fact that the engine was ‘regarded as working by pressure rather than by the transformation of heat
Pacey seems intent upon putting words in Lees mouth and ideas into his head: ‘It must have seemed very clear that there was some kind of fi xed rela- tionship between heat or temperature and power; but Lee did not try to defi ne it, Pacey states
Similar acts of ventriloquism appear in Paceys discussion of related work by Lees and Watts friend Peter (1)(2) In the early nineteenth century a number of publications discussed the relationship between mechanic power or vis viva, and the ‘force contained in gunpowder or coal
William Wol- laston argued in his Bakerian Lecture before the Royal Society in 1806 that one could be a measure of the other
Others however, were strongly critical of this idea, a writer in the Edinburgh Review [ John Playfair] contended, on the con- trary, that the work done by a steam engine must depend on the way in which the coal was burned, in particular whether it was burned quickly or slowly
Th is was an idea that Robison also expressed
It was at this stage that Ewart wrote a paper on the concept of ‘force or vis viva published a few years later in the Manchester Memoirs (1813) in which he defended Wollastons view
Pacey fi nds great signifi cance in a quotation from Ewarts paper defending (1)(2) Th e quotation is as follows: however slow or quick the combustion of the coals may be, if they be eff ectually burnt, the full quantity of heat must be given out
If the heat be allowed to escape without being communicated to the water; or if aft er being communicated to the water, the pressure of the steam be not wholly applied in producing the intended eff ect, the loss must be owing to practical imperfections in the construction of the apparatus … But although the whole heat, or the whole force, can in practice never be completely transferred from one given object to another, yet there can be no doubt of the real existence of both heat and the force in their full quantities…
Of this, Pacey says: Th e idea behind this seems to be of a quantity of heat being transferred from burning coal to the boiler, and then through the engine to the condenser, while at the same time there is a parallel generation of pressure and transfer of ‘force from the cylinder to the machines being driven
Th e transfer of ‘force must bear a fi xed relationship to a particular fl ow of heat – but no statement by any British experimenter at this time sheds any more light on the problem
Th is interpretation of what Ewart is saying is not the only possible one
I see no reason, for example, why the interpretation could not be couched in terms of the chemical combination of heat with water to produce steam
Pacey fi nds ‘the most disappointing feature of the episode to be that ‘Lee and his friends seem to have made very few explicit comments about the signifi cance of the experi- ments or about the ideas to which they gave rise
Perhaps their failure to do this resulted from the fact that they saw nothing new or startling in them
Why should we be disappointed at their failure to have more modern ideas
Pacey, however, continues to seek, and claims to fi nd, evidence that Lee was averse to theorizing, an attitude that might explain his failure to discuss the right things
Writing to James Lawson, a Boulton & Watt employee, Lee gave his response to Pronys second volume of his Nouvelle Architecture Hydraulique saying that he was ‘all out of patience with Prony … such a parade of Algebraical Formulae and total want of Candour and Justice to (1)(2) Watt, and a complete Ignorance of the physical properties of Steam
Pacey takes this to mean that Lee was an empiricist, averse to theory, and he diagnoses him as having ‘a weak- ness in ‘not seeing the need for clear principles and general concepts on which a theory of steam engines could be built
On the contrary Lees words might reasonably be taken to mean that he was happy with Watts account of the physi- cal properties of steam
On these grounds, I see no compelling reason at all for Paceys overall conclusion that ‘the science of thermodynamics has deeper roots in the eighteenth century than historians of the subject have so far acknowl- edged
If it does have such deeper roots, I dont see them as passing through Watt and his immediate circle
It is certainly true, as I argued in Chapter 2, that Watt and his associates were revising some of their conceptions in the early nine- teenth century but this was done by way of proofi ng Watts claims to philosophic engineering fame against uncertain shift s in the science of heat rather than as an exercise in prescience about thermodynamics
Norton Wise and other scholars have shown us that indicator diagrams came to have a protean quality in the nineteenth century
Not only have they been seen as crucial to representations within thermodynamics but also modifi cations of them have been traced in physiology (graphs of muscle and nerve action) and even in the supply and demand curves of political economy
Th ere is no doubt that these connections are real
However, it is also true that they are not continu- ous or ‘natural
Th ey involved Helmholtz and Fleeming Jenkin in considerable hard work to make them
Wise puts it this way in the case of Helmholtz: Conceptually speaking, Helmholtzs adaptation of engine indicators to physiological motive forces is extremely simple
Th ey are of particular interest because they move across immense diff erence in pressure and time scales
It is easy enough to say that the work of engines replaces that of muscles and therefore both should be subject to the same kind of analysis
It is quite another to compare a fi ft y-horsepower engine running at fi ft een revolutions per minute with a frog muscle developing a few ergs of energy almost instantaneously
Part of Helmholtzs genius, as Olesko and Holmes describe it, lay in his ability to design the extraordinarily sensitive mechanisms that could realize the conceptual analogy, rendering it quite precise in terms of the time development of the muscles energy
Th e point I want to extract from this is that whilst the analogy that moved the indicator diagram from one forum to another was (perhaps) conceptually sim- ple, its realization was complex
In the end it was the intercalation of the theory and detailed practices that sustained the analogical transposition
In exploring analogical moves between thermodynamics/engine practice and physiology or political economy, the ‘gap to be bridged is obvious
It is less obvious, but no less real, I suggest, in the matter of analogical moves between Watts use and understanding of indicator diagrams and their use by the likes of Clapeyron and (1)(2) Th is was what Tait gestured towards when he compared Watts practi- cal understanding of the indicator diagram with the ‘higher level to which the thermodynamicists took it
Not only this, I have argued, Watts practical under- standing was underwritten by a theoretical formulation completely alien to the nineteenth century
Th us those accounts of the Indicator Diagram that assimilate Watts use of it to its later conceptualization as a measure of work or energy in mid-nineteenth- century thermodynamics are misleading
Th ey read Watts understanding of the steam engine and the indicator diagram through the historical fog of both the chemical and the thermodynamic revolutions
– 169 – 7 CONCLUSIONS James Watt was certainly a ‘man o pairts, but he was also a coherent whole
For too long our historical understanding of him has emphasized the many parts, seeing the whole only dimly, if at all
By pursuing the links between his practical and theoretical work I have tried to set this to rights
Watt was an engineer
He was certainly an expert, as (1) (1) Forbes put it in his discussions of these ques- tions, at contrivance
Forbes admired Watts invention of the parallel motion as showing Watts genius for contrivance, but he argued that this in itself would never have been the basis for ‘reputation
Watts reputation derived from his quality as a philosophic engineer
I have argued that what gave his engineering its philosophic quality or dimension was largely chemical in character
Watt was a chemist, whose chemistry of heat provided the philosophical dimension to his engineering
Th at philosophical dimension was very diff erent from the equivalent dimension of what became known in the mid-nineteenth century as ‘engineering science
In engineering science heat was understood as a form of energy, convertible into other forms according to the fundamental laws of ther- modynamics
All this was foreign to the intellectual world that Watt inhabited
However, because Watt was adopted as an icon and founding father of their fi eld, the engineering scientists of the nineteenth century were not averse to smooth- ing over some of the diff erences between his world and theirs
Watt the chemist and engineer became Watt the mechanical engineer
In my early chapters I showed how popular representation of Watt, which became a minor industry itself in the nineteenth century, presented the mechan- ical (1)(2) Th is was a natural and easy thing to do given the association of Watt in the popular mind with contrivance
Th e products of that genius for contrivance, or so it seemed, were everywhere in Victorian Britain, the engines, the link- age and control mechanisms to convert the power of those engines into useful work, the indicators designed to monitor, measure and adjust their performance
Whether as the geometer of Chantreys statues, reordering mechanical space to institute the separate condenser, or as the bearer of devices, conceived as the product of a craft smans skill, in later nineteenth-century statues, the mechanical Watt was carved in stone and cast in brass to sit in Westminster, Glasgow, Edin- burgh, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and (1)(2) Th e indicator that the Watt statue installed in Greenock in the early twentieth century grasped trium- phantly in its hand was recognized by those who could recognize it at all either as the stethoscope of the practical working engineer or as the device which pro- duced the ‘indicator diagram that bridged the technological marvels of steam power and the scientifi c mysteries of thermodynamics
Here, too, Watt the great mechanician was celebrated
Th e other ubiquitous image of Watt, one broadcast far and wide by the steam press and new methods of pictorial reproduction developed in the nineteenth century, was the young Watt and the kettle
Th ese images and stories appealed to the idea of youthful genius prefi guring mature accomplishment
Usually the import of the image was nothing more than that
Exactly what was prefi gured was rarely of too much concern
Th e standard presumption was that the young Watt was realizing the power of steam, noticing the fact that steam might be a source of mechanical action
Sometimes the young Watt was seen as contem- plating the properties of steam, notably its condensability
But so far as those properties were understood at all by nineteenth-century audiences they were understood in terms of thermal laws – the physics of heat
So this aspect of Watt iconography also tended to reinforce the image of the mechanical (1)(2)
In textual treatments, the character and status of Watts achievement was much debated
I have shown that in the late eighteenth century a close connec- tion between Watts chemistry and his engineering accomplishments could be contemplated
In fact Watt broadcast such a connection, as did others
However, in the nineteenth century that connection was unravelled
Th e central fact behind the unravelling was the victory of Lavoisian chemistry and the rapid perception of phlogistic chemistry as archaic and misguided
Given this fact, Watts undoubted engineering achievements and his status as a profound engineer could not com- fortably, or reasonably, be connected to his archaic chemical understandings
Th is separation of Watts chemistry and his engineering was pushed along in a number of ways
One was through Watts self-fashioning in the early years of the nineteenth century
Th e scientifi c respectability of Watts steam experiments, the basis for his already strong reputation as a philosophical engineer, was threatened by the rapidly shift ing understandings of heat and the experiments of others
In such a situation the fact of the experiments having been done, and done by Watt as distinct from Joseph Black, had to be publicized
But the substance of them had to be adjusted to the modern idiom, their chemical character being de-emphasized
Th e account of the experiments fi nally published in Watts notes on Robisons essays on ‘Steam and on the ‘Steam Engine in 1822 was, I have suggested, a result of this process
Watts chemical understanding of heat was assimilated to the ther- mal laws explored by early nineteenth century investigators
Another episode acting to alienate chemistry and engineering in Watts accomplishment was the ‘water controversy
Whereas my earlier study of that controversy emphasized the ‘battle of the icons (Cavendish and Watt) driven by their value to contrasting ideologies of science–technology relations, my con- cern here has been with its consequences for the depiction of Watt as chemist and as engineer
My conclusion is that neither side in the water controversy could give a true contextual picture of Watt as chemist
Th ose who denied Watt status as chemical discoverer in the matter of the compound nature of water actively depicted his chemistry as archaic and just plain wrong
However, they had good reasons for wanting to support Watts status as a philosophical engineer
In order to maintain both these positions, any substantive connection between Watts chemistry and his engineering (or even an appreciation of how one provided a context for the other) could not be, and was not, countenanced
For their part, Watts supporters in the controversy sought to sustain his chemical reputa- tion by not venturing at all deeply into the substance of Watts chemical ideas
Instead they provided a gloss of those ideas as essentially similar to the modern- ized chemical understandings that had been constructed for Cavendish by his supporters
What was crucial, Watts advocates argued, was not the detailed sub- stance of Watts and Cavendishs ideas – both men had approached close enough to the chemical truth about water to have a legitimate claim – but rather the priority in having those ideas and communicating them
Th ey contended that Watt deserved the palm on both grounds
By pursuing this strategy Watts sup- porters obfuscated the ways in which the chemistry of heat had informed Watts steam engine improvements
Th ey continued the work of reinterpretation and re-emphasis that Watt had begun with his construction of the ‘Plain Story of the origins of those improvements
While early Victorian chemists resisted the adoption of Watt as a hero of their fi eld, the insurgent engineers of the mid-nineteenth century embraced him wholeheartedly
In particular, the engineering elite, who were pushing the status of their fi eld under the banner of ‘engineering science found a useful symbol in the ‘Great Steamer
Not long before, the status of engineer had been very prob- lematic
In fact, I argued that Watts undoubted self-identifi cation as such was eff ectively an act of defi ance in the learned world of the late eighteenth century, an act designed to assert the status of philosophical engineer against those who saw only lowly tradesmen
As the engineering profession developed in the nineteenth century, and its major institutions and educational frameworks were established, a number of groups advocated the cause of ‘engineering science
Th e Gentlemen of Science of the British Associations early years saw ‘engineering science as a way to institute hierarchical control over engineering by physical scientists, and even by gentle- men whose liberal education included mechanical science
Th eir representations of Watt as a philosophic engineer granted his engineering profound status whilst dismissing his chemistry as superfi cial
But the Gentlemen of Science were also usually anxious to stress that Watt the autodidact had in fact relied upon Profes- sor Black, and hence upon the academic world, for some of the key ingredients that rendered his engineering philosophic and eff ective
Th e Northern philosophers, such as Th omson, Rankine and Tait, who began from mid-century to eclipse the Gentlemen of Science in control of major scien- tifi c institutions, brought a diff erent approach to their advocacy of ‘engineering science
Th ey saw a genuine unifi cation of theory and practice without the clear domination of one by the other
Th ey exemplifi ed in their own backgrounds and careers the easy and untroubled combination of the roles of engineer and natural philosopher
As Peter Bowler and Iwan Morus put it, it was not so much that they ‘regarded their researches into the science of heat as being of potential use in improving the design of steam engines but that they regarded the two enter- prises – natural philosophical investigation and technological improvement – as being two sides of the same coin
Th eir depiction of Watt tended to refl ect this attitude
Th ey, unlike the Gentlemen of Science, were comfortable with Watt as a businessman and a patentee, seeing no reason why he could not combine these roles with those of engineer and natural philosopher
Although they were, on occasion, careful to recognize Watts own intellectual context, their enthusiasm for him as a precursor who personifi ed the unity of theory and practice, some- times led to elisions that aligned Watt closely, and falsely, with energy physics and thermodynamic insight
Th e painting that I have chosen as the frontispiece of this book, ‘James Watt and the Steam Engine: Dawn of the Nineteenth Century, which was produced by James Eckford Lauder in 1855, captures marvellously the range of represen- tations of Watt that were constructed in the nineteenth century
Lauder seems to have loaded into his picture all the variety of, sometimes contending, repre- sentations of Watt that various interests were generating
We have already seen Rankines praise of this image for its inclusion of the model Newcomen engine
Some who knew nothing of that model and its supposed signifi cance had criti- cized the picture for incorporating ‘an object so unattractive
However, Rankine declared the artist right to include it because ‘that small and uncouth mass of wood and metal shines with imperishable beauty, as the earliest embodiment of the genius of James Watt
So Rankine found Lauders painting inspiring because it showed how the engineer or mechanic could, through engineering science, rise ‘to the dignity of a Sage
Th e image, however, covers a number of other possibilities
Th e papers on the desk, with dividers poised, echo Chantreys Watt as geometrician
Tools arrayed in front of the model engine speak of Watt the craft sman in a gesture of solidarity with the working engineers who found self- affi  rmation in that image of the great man
Just identifi able behind the model is, it appears, a kettle on a stove
Th e viewer can pick a favourite symbol and fi nd reinforcement in Lauders painting for the preferred characterization of (1)(2)
However, the painting, in at least one respect, is perhaps ‘loaded towards a par- ticular view
Th e positioning of the kettle, consigned as it is to the background to the point of obscurity suggests how in the nineteenth century other symbols obscured the only one likely to lead to a proper appreciation of Watts approach to the science of steam
Th e subtitle that Lauder gave to his painting – ‘Dawn of the Nineteenth Century – conveys the idea that Watts invention caused the sun to rise on a new triumphant era in human material development
To me it also symbolizes the sun setting on a truly contextual understanding of Watts intellectual world and of his achievement because of the overwhelming urge to render Watt as a symbol of then contemporary utility
Leaving ‘Representations (except my own) behind, in Part 2 I set out to try to understand the realities of Watts intellectual universe
I argued that the dominant intellectual construct through most of his scientifi c and many of his engineering activities was the chemical theory of heat that he imbibed from Cullen and Black, and that he investigated in his kettle experiments
In many respects Watt did more than Black to explore the ramifi cations of that theory
It was with him throughout his collaborations with Priestley, De Luc and Bed- does and it informed not only his steam experiments and engine improvements but also his work on water, on airs and on pneumatic medicine
In the course of tracing these developments I have tried to show that Watt was not a mere specu- lative chemist in his collaboration with Priestley but rather he conducted many experiments both in the laboratory and ‘in the large
Particularly signifi cant, I think, but as yet barely glimpsed, are the signs that Watts thinking about the chemistry of water was partially shaped by observations made of the operation of steam engines
Whether in the laboratory or erecting or testing an engine Watt was ever alert to, and anxious for, chemical understandings
Although Watt was one of the last of the phlogistians, his ideas were not unchanging
His reading as well as his laboratory experiments and his practical ventures, such as chlorine bleaching, meant that Watt routinely imported new ideas into his chemical thinking
We saw from his excursion into the debates about chemical nomenclature that he eventually adopted, and adapted, ‘oxygene as a replace- ment for De Lucs ‘humor (the principle of ‘aquosity), but did so in a way that preserved, and in his view strengthened, phlogistic chemistry
He was evidently impressed by Berthollets ideas about affi  nity and used them in his inquiries into the production and mode of action of medically useful airs
Th ere is, I think, much more to learn about the interactions of Watts practical and theoretical chemistry, but perhaps these examples point the way
In particular, I hope that future, more detailed, reconstructions of Watts chemistry in his dealings with the wider world of the British and European Republic of Letters will bear the steam engine in mind rather than shunting it onto a branch line
It is very diffi  cult for us to think about steam engines as anything other than heat engines in which the steam is merely a ‘working substance, a con- duit for the passage of heat from one body to another and its conversion into mechanical work
Yet, if we are to think like Watt about steam engines, we have to leave those ideas behind
For him, as I have repeatedly emphasized, steam was a compound of water and elementary heat, and its properties, notably its elasticity, upon which the operation of the cylinder and the viability of the separate condenser depended, derived from this compounding
Th e traditional arguments about whether Watts improvements of the steam engine depended on the concept of latent heat or not in many ways miss the point
Certainly, the specifi c heat of the cylinder and the avoidance of its repeated heating, cooling and reheating were initially more directly important to those improvements than ideas derived from latent heat
But in an important sense the heat latent in steam was a conceptual sub-stratum of all Watts thinking about the steam engine
It surfaced directly in relation to the problem of ‘back pressure and also in his experimental derivation of ‘Watts Law and conceptualization of the expansive working of engines, but it was always there
Seeing the steam engine as a chemical device is not just a matter of appre- ciating the importance of Watts chemical thinking in his routes to the engines improvement
It also requires us to consider what I have called the ‘ecology of steam
For Watts philosophical circle, the chemical theory of heat was important to the understanding of a great variety of natural phenomena, especially geological and meteorological processes
I have shown that there was considerable transposi- tion of understandings from one realm to another
Watt learned from De Lucs meteorology, while the Genevan profi ted from Watts steam experiments
Hut- ton gained much from the chemistry of calcareous materials, of airs and of steam in weaving together his ideas about the role of heat in geological processes
Ana- logical reasoning abounded as De Luc and Darwin imagined steam engines in the clouds and Hutton conceived the Earth as a heat machine incorporating pistons and spiracles (safety-valves)
We must be careful not to use the term ‘heat engine, of course, because that disguises the fact that it was the chemical compounding of heat that was important
Apart from their own intrinsic interest and value, these geological and meteorological musings were important reinforcements for, and affi  rmations of, Watts understandings of the steam engine
Th ey lent coherence to its place in an understanding of the natural order
Finally, my analysis moved to the story, and signifi cance of, the indicator and the indicator diagram
Th e tale behind the placing of this device in the right hand of Watts statue on the banks of the Clyde is certainly a tangled one
Straightening out the origins and evolution of the indicator technology is important
It shows us, for example, that Watt had begun with the idea of literally seeing inside the steam engine to gauge the state of the steam, to see the physical manifestations of variations in its chemical constitution during the course of a steam cycle
A series of devices culminated, thanks largely to the work of John Southern rather than Watt himself, in the recording indicator
Only at this stage was it possible to make semi-abstract identifi cations of the area of the indicator diagram with the work done by the engine
Th is was still a long way conceptually from the ‘dia- gram of energy of the nineteenth-century thermodynamicists
Partly because of the secrecy that surrounded it for many years the history of the indicator was oft en ‘telescoped
Th e case of (1) (1) Preeces misidentifi cation of a recording indicator as dating from 1785 shows how readily the telescoping of the material history of the indicator could create false impressions of Watts prescience as an energy physicist and proto-thermodynamicist
In all these ways, then, the story of the indicator captures much of the proc- ess whereby the mechanical Watt eclipsed the chemical Watt in the nineteenth century
Th e indicator also raises other broader theoretical and historiographi- cal issues going beyond the present study but upon which it throws some light
Th ese issues, which have to do with the whole question of the relations of sci- ence and technology, are raised by Davis Bairds notion of ‘Th ing Knowledge as applied to the case of the indicator
While Baird fi nds knowledge in things and thus collapses science and tech- nology together, I fi nd the continuous inosculation of theory and practice a more viable notion
Th e way that we conceptualize things is a crucial determinant of what they are
Th ey do not autonomously carry meanings
Of course things do in a sense ‘resist but only by virtue of making it diffi  cult for us to attach mean- ings to them
Resistance as such is not identifi able
We cannot, then, study Watt purely as an engineer or purely as a natural philosopher
Th e interaction of the scientifi c and the practical is what needs to be understood
I have refl ected this in my treatment of Watts chemistry and of his steam-engine improvements
However, this study is predicated on the assumption that it is meaningful to seek analysis of just what the ‘science that entered into the science/engineering amalgam in Watts ventures was
In Peter (1) Joness terms I treat Watt as ‘savant- fabricant but still feel entitled to ask just what kind of ‘savant he was
I also feel impelled to ask that question
Amalgams of science and practice by historical actors can profoundly mislead us about what earlier amalgams were like
Th is is why I have felt the need to prise apart the study of heat and the production of the steam engine as a preliminary to putting them back together again in a new, more contextually sensitive, form
James Watt was a chemist
He was also an engineer
We understand him, and the origins of the steam age, better if we can see him as both at the same time

It is also interesting to note that the issue of representing Watts most important improve- ments graphically was a central one in the patent trials of the 1790s, when his patent specifi cation was attacked because of its failure to include mechanical drawings of a spe- cifi c contrivance
Th at omission was a conscious one by Watt and his friends to avoid limiting the scope of the patents to a particular mechanical realization of the (chemical) principles that he sought to claim
To limit scope in that way would be to invite engine pirates to circumvent the patent by producing only slight variations in the specifi ed mechanical form
Chantreys images of Watts machinery are in this sense readable as an abstract geometrical account of basic chemical principle, at least so far as the sepa- rate condenser is concerned
But of course they were never read as such but rather as a mechanical idea of the separate condenser

For many years this statue stood in McPhun Park, Glasgow, headless as a result of vandalism
(I will resist the temptation to suggest that the vandals were endorsing the craft sman, rather than the philosopher, view of (1)(2)) Obviously the head was restored, and the statue was cleaned when the statue was moved to its new site near the ‘Peo- ples Palace
It had been commissioned originally in 1864 by the fi rm of (1) & (1) Martin, leather merchants, and stood in a niche above the entrance to their works at 8 Baltic St, Bridgeton until it was given to Glasgow Corporation Parks Committee in 1936

http://www(1)bras(1)k/montypython/episode38(1)tm#11 Th e Presenter is introducing a  documentary on medical breakthroughs
He utters some of the truest words ever spo- ken in jest about the nature of discovery: ‘Penguins, yes, penguins
What relevance do penguins have to the furtherance of medical science
Well, strangely enough quite a lot, a major breakthrough, maybe
It was from such an unlikely beginning as an unwanted fungus accidentally growing on a sterile plate that Sir Alexander Fleming gave the world penicillin
James Watt watched an ordinary household kettle boiling and conceived the potentiality of steam power
Would Albert Einstein ever have hit upon the theory of relativity if he hadnt been clever
All these tremendous leaps forward have been taken in the dark
Would Rutherford ever have split the atom if he hadnt tried
Could Marconi have invented the radio if he hadnt by pure chance spent years working at the problem
Are these amazing breakthroughs ever achieved except by years and years of unremitting study
Of course not
What I said earlier about accidental discoveries must have been wrong
Nevertheless scientists believe that these penguins, these comic fl ightless web- footed little bastards may fi nally unwittingly help man to fathom the uncharted depths of the human mind

On Stone see (1) (1) Baldry, Marcus Stone, (1) (1) His Life and Work (London: Art Journal, 1896)
Th ere are in fact two very similar engravings of Stones painting
Th e one by James Scott is shown in Figure 1(1)
Th is was declared in 1869, published by Henry Graves and Co, and reproduced by (1)(2) Herbert Bourne produced a second engraving, incorpo- rating specifi c diff erences of detail and in a less delicate style
Th is can be seen reproduced in (1) (1) Engen (ed
(1) Best), Victorian Engravings (London: (1)(2) Martins, 1975), p(1)
One interesting diff erence is that Bournes engraving does not have a sword hanging beside the Watt hearth as Scotts does
Given that the ‘action in the picture would date from the years immediately aft er 1745, and that aft er the rising the possession of arms was prohibited by the 1746 Disarming Act, for someone familiar with those aspects of Scottish history, the sword would have controversial implications concerning the poli- tics of the Watt household
It is interesting that these issues reverberated in Victorian times
I have been unable to locate the original Stone painting and do not know whether or not it included the sword
31
Th e only modern reading of this picture that I know of is by Susan Casteras, who con- fi rms that it is a depiction of young male genius
Th is was a popular genre, with a stream of paintings depicting the early lives of composers, artists, writers, painters and leaders being produced at this time
Casteras is, however, little interested in what the young Watt is up to in the painting except that he is being a youthful, male genius
See (1) (1)
Casteras, ‘Excluding Women: the Cult of the Male Genius in Victorian Painting, in (1)

At one point in the dialogue of Letting off  Steam James says: ‘Th ats funny
When the steam cant get out of the spout, it pushes up the lid
Despite its apparent reliance on the Stone painting for inspiration the play thus has Watt perceiving the power of steam rather than its properties
Th e play also refl ects the tendency of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century stories about Watt to couple invocations of his genius with accounts of his hard work
Th us in Scene Two, in an exchange between Watt as an old man and a friend, we read: ‘Friend: Youve had a wonderful career
Wonderful luck
James: Do you know how you spell the word ‘luck
Friend: l-u-c-k
James: W-O-R-K

I am aware of two versions of the memoranda containing the kettle anecdote
Th e fi rst is that long held at Doldowlod and sold at Sothebys in 2003
It is a document sent by Miss Jane Campbell to Watt Jr in December 1834
Watt Jr annotated it with the title ‘Memoranda of the early Years of (1)(2) Watt, by his cousin, (1)(2) Marion Campbell (born Muirhead, and daughter of his Mothers sister who was his companion in Youth and inti- mate friend through life; communicated by her to her daughter Miss Jane Campbell, in 1798, who then wrote them down
Transmitted by her to J Watt in Decr(1)
Th is doc- ument is in Miss Campbells hand
My claim is that Watt Jr made the change of ‘power to ‘properties evident in it
Th e second manuscript version of the document (Muirhead Papers, Birmingham Central Library, MI/8/20, new reference MS3219/6/219) is in a third hand, probably that of someone acting as a copyist for Watt Jr at that time, with annotations by Watt Jr at the end
Watt Jr has also inscribed the date ‘22 January 1835 at the top of the document
Th is strongly suggests that it is Watt Jrs retained copy of what he sent to Arago with his letter of that date
Th is copy diff ers from the Sothebys docu- ment in several respects: (1) the title is slightly diff erent, ending ‘who was his companion in youth & friend through life; dictated to and written down by her daughter Miss Jane Campbell in 1798; (2) a sentence concerning Watts carpenters tools given to him by his father is inserted; (3) the beginning of the quotation concerning the kettle incident has Watts aunt referring to ‘James Watt, rather than ‘Jamie Watt; (4) the document refers to ‘properties of steam although from a diff erence in the quality of the writing it appears as if this copy may have initially read ‘power of steam and been modifi ed
Th ese diff erences act as markers in determining which of the two documents was used in subsequent pub- lications
It appears that the second document, as edited by Watt Jr, became the source used by Arago, Watt Jr and (1)(2)
40
Other correspondence with Jane Campbell, also part of lot 5 of the Sothebys sale, shows Watt Jr correcting related aspects of her account, notably her claim that Watt attended Blacks lectures at (1)(2) See Sothebys, Th e James Watt Sale, p(1)
Watt Jr pointed out that his father had explicitly denied this

Musson and Robinson, Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution, Eric Robin- sons early treatment of the kettle myth as having a genuine historical basis (Robinson, ‘James Watt and the Tea Kettle) can plausibly be seen as aiding a general endorsement of Watts scientifi c status and therefore a move in these historical debates

Perhaps Watt Jr also read the Buss painting as a depiction of his father contemplating the properties of steam
Such a reading is certainly possible even though to us it might seem more ‘natural to read it the other way

While Carnegie made £10,000 available he insisted that an attempt be made to raise money from small donations from around the world
To this end an elaborate structure of heads of memo- rial committees in the US, Canada and Australia as well as in Scotland/England was set up
(See (1) Caird to Carnegie, 26 August 1903, vol(1), ff (1)–18449 and 7 Sep- tember 1903, vol(1) ff (1)–18478, Andrew Carnegie Papers, Library of Congress, Washington, (1) (1)) Ten thousand circulars were distributed seeking donations, but a disappointingly small sum was raised
Carnegie sent £5,000 on behalf of ‘the American subscribers (probably most of it came from his own pocket), and subsequently brought the sum up to £10,000

It became widely agreed that by later (mid-nineteenth century) standards the Watt patent specifi cation would have been invalid because incomplete
In fact the crucial judgment in relation to James Beaumont Neilsons hot blast patent in the mid-nineteenth cen- tury established that the patenting of any one concrete method for realizing a principle eff ectively gave protection against all other methods of realizing it
Th e argumentation that supported that decision cited the Watt patent in support of Neilsons case

Th e fact that post-1800 narratives were craft ed with reference to earlier ones is, however, indicated by the fact that later statements are found in the archive collected together with earlier ones, the collection having evidently been done by Watt himself

Private narratives began much earlier
Indeed Watts famous 1765 notebook of his exper- iments (of which much more below) is in part a narrative reconstruction of Watts work
Many modern historians of science recognize that there is no clear demarcation to be made between the production and the communication of scientifi c knowledge so that primary scientifi c documents, and even laboratory notebooks, should themselves be seen as narratives presenting and constituting discovery

Th e dependence of Watt upon Black for the fact of latent heat, which is implied here, was evidence for all those later accounts that continued to portray Watt the craft sman engineer as dependent on Black the philoso- pher
35
Th e ‘Plain Story was thus evidently part of a tactic that ran counter to the description of Watts invention as a chemical one
Th ese were alternative ways of avoiding the iden- tifi cation of Watts invention as being mechanical and therefore requiring mechanical specifi cation
Watt and his counsel were, I suggest, opportunistic in moving from one to the other

Southern explained: ‘It is well known that if common air be expanded, cold is produced… if a given quantity of it at a given temperature could be gradually expanded, and as it was so expanded, gradually supplied with heat, so as to keep the tem- perature unaltered, this supply of heat would become latent; the thermometer would not show it
It is probable, both from analogy and experiment, that this eff ect takes place in the expansion of steam
It is not of this part of its heat, though latent, and, in the experi- ments above related, undistinguishable, that I would be understood to speak when I state my opinion to be as just mentioned; but it is of that which, when water alters its state to that of an elastic fl uid, becomes essential to it in every degree of elasticity, besides that which belongs to its expanded state
Th is latter may be called the latent heat of expansion, while the other may perhaps properly be called constitutional

Watt was balloted and elected 24 November 1785
‘Inventor might be thought to face some of the same status diffi  culties as ‘engineer
However many if not most inventors associated with the Royal Society were gentlemen, and there would have been no automatic connection in Fellows minds between an inventor and the taint of trade

See Watt to William Small, 24 November 1772, in Muirhead, Origin and Progress, vol

Watt recorded in his journal having written to Small that ‘in recommending me to canals &c, he should observe I would only be engineer not Manager & would have nothing to do with cash or workmen
(‘Journal of James Watt, July 1772–April 1773, Archives of Soho, MS3219/4/134, p(1)
) We must be careful, however, in pushing this perception too far
In some respects Watt was just as astute and eff ective a businessman as his partner Boulton, to whom is usually ascribed all the acumen in that department
See Miller, ‘Scales of Justice

‘Letter proposed to be addressed to Mr Prony by J Watt in the year 1803…, in Archives of Soho, MS3219/4/287/7

Maurice Crosland has pointed out to me the ‘embarrassment for my general argument (about Watt as chemist) of the fact that ‘in publications he insisted on describing himself as an engineer, and added that it was ‘surprising that he felt it necessary to describe his profession like this
It was not as if he was claiming to be a member of an elite society
(Personal communication, 16 January 2009
) My suggestion that Watt was making a point about the term ‘engineer off ers an explanation for this otherwise surprising act of self-identifi cation

William Small to Watt, [
] December 1773, extracted in Muirhead, Origin and Progress, pp(1)–2, on p(1)
Th e role of writing in Watts career was much discussed around this time
Both Small and Boulton encouraged him to either write the treatise on steam or a paper for the Philosophical (1)(2) Small thought that writing would advance Watts reputation
When combined with a trip to France it would, as he put it, raise the ‘curiosity of the English … to see the philosophical and travelled engineer, (Watt to Small, 27 October 1773 in ibid, p(1))
However, Small had earlier advised that Watt might still have to reconcile himself to ‘engineering in the vulgar manner – that is civil engineering works – to earn a living
(Small to Watt, 19 October 1771, in ibid, p(1)
) When he heard that Watt was considering going abroad, Small sought to dissuade him by holding up the prospect of a career as a consultant engineer: ‘You might live by inventing only an hour in a week for mathematical instrument makers
(Small to Watt, [
] Decem- ber 1773, ibid, p(1)
) Boulton also encouraged Watts writing, but characteristically with a steady eye on its publicity value

Here is the quotation from Macaulay: ‘Th e mathematician can easily demonstrate that a certain power, applied by means of a cer- tain lever, or of a certain system of pulleys, will suffi  ce to raise a certain weight
But his demonstration proceeds on the supposition that the machinery is such as no load will bend or break
If the engineer who has to lift  a great mass of real granite by the instrumentality of real timber and real hemp, should absolutely rely on the propositions which he fi nds in treatises on Dynamics, and should make no allowance for the imper- fection of his materials, his whole apparatus of beams, wheels, and ropes, would soon come down in ruin, and with all his geometrical skill, he would be found a far inferior builder to those painted barbarians who, though they never heard of the parallelogram of forces, managed to pile up Stonehenge

4 Watts Chemistry of Heat 1
I do not want to suggest, however, that Watts practical chemistry was always related to his theoretical ideas
Like Black and Cullen before him, whose chemical courses had come to incorporate not only scraps of chemistry relating to materia medica but also a panoply of industrially-relevant operations, Watt became an adept ‘cookbook chemist of a strongly empirical type
One of the things that those who defended Blacks unwillingness to jump to ‘System were defending against was the idea that the only legitimate chemical opera- tions were those that had been or could be integrated into a unifi ed theoretical system
Watt undoubtedly shared some of this suspicion of the tendency to system

In eighteenth-century natural philosophy the term ‘principle was deployed to designate one of the simplest forms of matter from which other substances are formed through combinations with other principles
Th e term was also used, as in Huttons case here, to refer to a source of agency

Huttons concept of ‘solar substance, developed in (1) Hut- ton, Dissertations on Diff erent Subjects in Natural Philosophy (Edinburgh: Strahan and Cadell, 1792), was a crucial cause of embarrassment for (1)(2) For Hutton, however, ‘solar substance was a central aspect of his theory, not least because it unifi ed chemical change and the phenomenon of light
An important criticism of the new chemistry in the 1790s and into the 1800s was that it failed to account for such phenomena
Th is was argued by the young Henry Brougham, surveying the chemical scene for the Edinburgh Review in the course of a review of Robisons edition of Blacks lectures: (1) Brougham, ‘Lectures on the Elements of Chemistry, Edinburgh Review, 2 (1803), pp(1)–26

Blacks lectures show that his other chemical ideas interacted very little with his chem- istry of heat as such
In many ways Blacks long-term reputation was helped by this since it made it relatively easy to prize apart his achievements into chemical discovery (e
g
of ‘fi xed air) and physical discovery (the ‘thermal laws relating to latent heat)

Donovan, Philosophical Chemistry argues convincingly that Blacks early investigations of caustic- ity and of fi xed air were ‘guided by an underlying conception of the general laws which link heat, elective attraction and change of state
(p(1))
Th us, although Black did not do much by way of sequel to pursue the other chemical consequences of the concept of latent heat, he arguably did so in this ‘prequel

Watt wrote to William Small from Glasgow on 6 May 1774 that ‘My friend (1)(2) Irvine in winter discovered what is the lowest possible degree of heat, or the real beginning of the scale; by which means thermometers may be made showing the real quantity of heat in bodies
(See Muirhead, Origin and Progress, vol(1), p(1)
) 29
Adair Crawford studied with Irvine at Glasgow and applied his teachers doctrines to animal heat
His book Experiments and Observations on Animal Heat (London: (1) Mur- ray, 1779; 2nd edn, 1788) enjoyed wide circulation and its ambiguities led to Crawford being given credit for many of Irvines ideas, and some of Blacks
Watt was incensed by this, and noted that Crawford ‘seems not to have been much disposed to do either (1)(2)
Black or (1)(2) Irvine justice
Watt believed that the only valuable parts of Crawfords volu- minous writings were those that he had purloined from Black and (1)(2) He thought that Crawfords own experiments and theories were ‘of little value, although they serve as one of the props to the French theories

De Luc (1727–1817) was a prominent Genovese citizen who, from his appointment as Reader to Queen Charlotte in 1775, became a signifi cant fi gure in the Royal Court at (1)(2) From the early 1780s Watt and De Luc developed a close relationship involv- ing frequent exchange of natural philosophical news and views
As we will see, they occasionally conducted research together
De Luc partially oversaw the Continental educational tourism of James Watt (1)(2) An anecdotal, but useful account of De Luc is (1)
(1) Tunbridge, ‘Jean André De Luc, (1) (1) (1) (1727–1817), Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, 26 (1971), pp(1)–33
A reputation for having plagiarized Joseph Black, together with De Lucs scriptural geology – much criticized by Charles Gillispie in Genesis and Geology – have perhaps too long delayed the serious assessment of his contributions and importance by historians of science

119
Between mid-1792 and late 1793 Beddoes published a number of works, which set out the theoretical basis for his plans to develop pneumatic medicine
Th at basis lay primarily in the notion of regulating the atmosphere, that is, adjusting (in experi- mental and clinical situations) the amount of oxygen that the breathed atmosphere contained, or at least the amount of oxygen taken in by patients
See, in particular, (1)

234–5 which agrees with Partington that Berthollets Eléments de lArt de la Teinture,
vols (Paris, 1791) was important in the development and application of those ideas
It appears that these ideas also became part of the currency of the debate between the phlo- gistians and anti-phlogistians
Priestley in Th e Doctrine of Phlogiston Established (1800) states: ‘I once thought with the Antiphlogistians that fi xed air was held in solution in the heavy infl ammable air, because when it is fi red together with dephlogisticated air much fi xed air is produced; but I am now satisfi ed that all the oxygen in that fi xed air comes from the dephlogisticated air with which it is fi red (p(1))

Telling Eras- mus Darwin of Gregorys departure, Watt said: ‘Gregory being gone to College, I make no experiments being only half alive

In his previous letter to Darwin of 30 June, Watt had referred to the process of expelling ‘infl ammable air from red hot zinc by water, which signalled to Darwin that Watt might still be adhering to anti-Lavoisian ideas
Darwin, who had abandoned belief in phlogiston himself, inquired gently: ‘…you speak of obtaining infl ammable air from (1)(2) Do you hold the theory that the infl ammable air (Hydrogen) is extracted from the Zinc, as your expression seems [to] countenance, or do you suppose that it is from the decomposition of water according to the idea of poor Lavoisier

Another experiment involving airs that was intended to give insight into meteorologi- cal phenomena, was made by Boulton and Watt in 1784
Th ough generally suspicious of the thirst for empty spectacle activating most ‘balloonomania, as Watt called it, he did see potential value for natural philosophical inquiry
A balloon fi lled with a mixture of common and infl ammable air was equipped with a lighted fuse and launched
Th e intention was ‘to determine whether the Growling of thunder is owing to echos or to successive explosions
Unfortunately, a loud shout from the crowd, which had assembled to see the experiment interfered with the experimenters hearing of the explosion of the balloon and the immediate aft ermath of it
(See Hills, James (1)(2) Volume 2, pp(1)–5
) Th e crowds frustration of his philosophical purpose neatly manifested the confl ict that Watt and others saw between balloons as spectacle and as instruments of philosophical inquiry

Watt to Gilbert Hamilton, 28 September 1783, Archives of Soho, MS3219/4/123, 42
I am assuming that the publication to which Watt refers here was what eventually became De Lucs Idées sur la Météorologie
22
It is not clear, for example, that in breaking the news of De Lucs theory to Hamilton Watt was also showing that the theory was new to him
But if it was new to him in
he could hardly have been explicitly rejecting it in the letters of 1779 and 1780 that Feld- mann uses to suggest that he did
Indeed those letters may simply have been referring to what Watt regarded as a standard view of things at the time
Of course, it is also true that Watts desire to give De Luc every assistance in advancing his ideas did not necessarily mean that Watt endorsed them
23

Th is is ironic given Playfairs role in disguising the details of Huttons chemistry of heat and their role in his theory

Erasmus Darwin to Matthew Boulton, 12 December [17]65, Archives of Soho, MS 3782/13/53/30, as transcribed in King-Hele (ed
), Collected Letters of Darwin, pp
65–6
I have omitted (1)(2) King-Heles interpolation of ‘at aft er ‘as in his transcription of this letter
Th is interpolation is an understandable but I think erroneous ‘correc- tion or unnecessary amplifi cation
Th is is so because Darwins concern is with the co-variation of the size of the surface at which the steam is produced and the quantity of that steam
So throughout the letter he refers to quantity varying either ‘as the upper surface of the boiling water or ‘as the surface of the vessel in contact with the fi re
Th e location of the production of the steam (‘at
) is implicit in the covariation (‘as…)
51
Ibid, p(1)
In a jocular, but nevertheless telling, analogy in this same letter Darwin com- pared the way the strength and activity of man depended on the ‘Quantity of vital Steam rising into the Brain from his boiling Blood with the way that ‘this Animal [the steam- engine] depended on the design of the boiler
52
Watts notebook in 1765 recorded studies of the boiler of Jonathan Sissons engine: ‘…I saw no boyler so perfect… as the common tea kitchen [kettle]…
Here the fuel is always in contact with the sides of the boyler containing the water…
Th is is consistent with the view that the signifi cant factor in producing steam is to ensure the maximum proximity of heat (fi re particles) and water

Although Riskins account of ‘sentimental empiricism is based in the French context, she does seem open to it being manifest elsewhere, in fact wherever the confl ict over the new rationalist lan- guage of Lavoisian chemistry and the language of phlogiston was alive
Riskin mentions Hutton in this regard (p(1))

Even this becomes doubtful if it is true that Watts own accounts, such as the ‘Plain Story, were activated as much by the objective of creating particular impressions in contested situations as they were by giving a ‘true history
I have argued in my account of Watts ‘self-fashioning (Chapter 2 above) that they were so activated

Th e confi dence that historians oft en have in the source of this statement is misplaced
Th e statement is attributed most oft en to Lawrence Joseph Henderson, the Harvard physi- ologist, historian and sociologist
(1) (1) Conant, Science and Common Sense (London: Oxford University Press, 1951), p(1) tells us that Henderson was ‘fond of remarking that before 1850 the steam engine did more for science than science did for the steam engine
Conant was possibly the source for the quote in (1) (1) Gillispie, Th e Edge of Objectivity (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1960), p(1), where it is treated sceptically, and the admission of ‘some truth in it by (1) (1) Forbes, ‘Power to 1850, in (1)

Web-based sources frequently date the quotation to 1917 but it does not appear in Hendersons Th e Order of Nature, published in that year
None of the attributions to Henderson that I have seen refer to an alternative printed source
(1) (1) Bernal, Science and Industry in the Nineteenth Century (London: Routledge, 1953), p(1), expresses similar sentiments
Lord Kelvin is sometimes attributed with a variant substituting ‘thermody- namics for ‘science, but the source of this I also fi nd remarkably fugitive, and I have seen it credited to (1) Willard (1)(2)

I am very grateful to Dr Jim Andrew for showing me the Th inktank indicator during a visit there in November 2007, for subsequently photographing it, for further inspect- ing it to fi nd the engraving, and also documenting its provenance
At the Cornwall Works of the Tangye family in Birmingham there was an exhibition devoted to James Watt in which the indicator was centrally displayed in a glass case
Th is is evident from a photograph of the exhibition on the ‘Digital Handsworth website (http://www(1)igital- handsworth(1)rg(1)k/)
Th e exhibition is dated to 1900– c(1), but was probably before 1911 since the artefact passed to Birmingham City Council along with the Boulton & Watt papers at that time
Th e Local Studies and History Department of Birmingham Central Library holds the original photograph
39
Th is misdating was in fact an error on Preeces part
Th e question of who inscribed the misleading date on the indicator, when they did it, and why, remains open
One pos- sibility is that this was done at the time of the sale of the instrument in 1895 and that the inscription refl ected folklore internal to the Soho Foundry in the later nineteenth century identifying the instrument as Watts ‘original

Baird, ‘Instruments, p(1)
Baird is, of course, drawing and building on recent emphasis by a number of scholars, including notably Peter Galison and Andy Pickering, upon the importance of ‘practices in science by way of critique of theory-centrism in accounts of science dynamics
See (1) Galison, Image and Logic: A Material Culture of Microphysics (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1997); A Pickering, Th e Mangle of Practice: Time, Agency and Science (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1995)
However, given that instruments cannot speak for themselves, it seems to me that the idea of ‘hard- ware-discourse couples is a better concept than ‘Th ing Knowledge in pursuing such questions
See, for example, (1) (1) Schuster and (1) Watchirs, ‘Natural Philosophy, Experi- ment and Discourse: Beyond the Kuhn/Bachelard Problematic, in (1) LeGrand (ed
