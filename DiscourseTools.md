Introduction
Discourse analysis is the study of language at use in the world, not just to say
things, but also to do things. People use language for lots of different things.
They use it to communicate, co-operate, and to help others. They use it to
build things like marriages, reputations, and institutions. They also use it to
lie, advantage themselves, harm people, and destroy things like marriages,
reputations, and institutions.
There are many different approaches to discourse analysis. Some of these are
part of the discipline of linguistics and these approaches to discourse analysis
are tied closely to the study of grammar. Some approaches to discourse analysis
are not as closely tied to the grammatical details of language, but concentrate on
ideas, issues, and themes as they are expressed in talk and writing.
In my book An Introduction to Discourse Analysis: Theory and Method (Fourth
Edition, 2014), I argue that any theory of discourse analysis is made up of a
set of tools with which to analyze language in use. In my view, no one theory
is universally right or universally applicable. Each theory offers tools which
work better for some kinds of data than they do for others. Furthermore,
anyone engaged in their own discourse analysis must adapt the tools they
have taken from a given theory to the needs and demands of their own study.
A book about discourse analysis can take two different approaches. It can
offer wide coverage of different theories or it can offer one theory in some
detail, a theory that is meant to offer good tools for some purposes and to be
a good preparation for learning other approaches for other purposes later on.
My book, An Introduction to Discourse Analysis: Theory and Method and this
one are based on this second approach. The theory in both these books is one
that sees discourse analysis as tied closely to the details of language structure
(grammar), but that deals with meaning in social, cultural, and political terms,
a broader approach to meaning than is common in mainstream linguistics. At
the same time, both books are meant to lay a foundation for later learning of
other approaches to discourse analysis.
So, then, why two books, both devoted to introducing discourse analysis?
People learn and teach differently. An Introduction to Discourse Analysis:
Theory and Method offers explanations and examples, but it does not give
readers lots of work of their own to do. It also does not offer a detailed “how
to” approach. This book, while it has explanation and examples, does leave a
lot for readers to do and does give detailed instructions of a “how to” sort.
 2 Introduction
However, readers need to be warned that there is no grand agreed-upon
body of content for discourse analysis. There are too many approaches and
controversies for that. So I offer my own ideas—what I believe in—but not in
the hope that you will believe everything I say, but in the hope that you will
make up your own mind and develop your own style and contributions. That
is really what “how to” means in this book: learn how eventually to go on your
own and choose your own companions on your path to understanding and
intervention in the world.
This book is based around 28 tools for doing discourse analysis. In each
case, I explain the tool and give an example of how to use it. Then I give
readers data and questions that allow them to practice using the tool. The
tools are all collected together in an appendix. Readers should also practice
using each of the tools on their own data.
What do I mean by a “tool” for discourse analysis? A tool for discourse
analysis is a specific question to ask of data. Each question makes the reader
look quite closely at the details of language in an oral or written communication.
Each question also makes the reader connect these details to what speakers or
writers mean, intend, and seek to do and accomplish in the world by the way
in which they have used language.
The tools are not ordered. They are all meant to apply at once to any data
that is being analyzed. For some data, some tools will yield more illuminating
information than for other data. But they can all be asked for each piece of
data. In some ways, though, I introduce the tools backwards. A discourse
analysis, in my view, would start with the tools in Unit 4 (they are about “the
big picture,” including things that go beyond language). But this does not
mean that starting there is a good way to learn. Once readers have finished this
book and want to engage in their own discourse analyses on their own data,
they may well want to start with the tools in Unit 4 and work backwards
through the 28 tools. On the other hand, each reader may well find their own
favored order in which to use the tools.
The approach to discourse analysis in this book applies to both speech and
writing. The examples and data in the book come from both. However,
because I do not want to have to keep repeating “speech and writing” and
“speakers and writers” and “listeners and readers,” I will throughout the book
just talk about speech, speakers, and listeners. Readers should keep in mind,
though, that usually I am talking about both speech and writing (except in
obvious cases where only one applies, as when we talk about pausing or pitch
changes in the voice).
Because some of the data we deal with comes from speech, the issue of how
to transcribe speech arises. With ever more sophisticated recording and
computer equipment, it is possible to get incredibly detailed records of speech
that include small pauses, slight hesitations, and subtle changes in sound,
pitch, rate, and loudness. It is tempting to believe that such detailed records
represent some pure, objective, and unanalyzed “reality.” In fact, they do no 
 Introduction 3
such thing. Speech always has far more detail in it than any recording or
transcription system could ever capture.
A discourse analysis is based on the details of speech (and gaze and gesture
and action) that are arguably deemed relevant in the context where the speech
was used and that are relevant to the arguments the analyst is attempting to
make. A discourse analysis is not based on all the physical features present,
not even all those that might, in some conceivable context, be meaningful, or
might be meaningful in analyses with different purposes.
Any speech data can be transcribed in more or less detailed ways such that
we get a continuum of possible transcripts ranging from very detailed (what
linguists call “narrow”) transcripts to much less detailed (what linguists call
“broad”) ones. While it is certainly wise to begin one’s analysis by transcribing
for more detail than may in the end be relevant, ultimately it is the purposes
of the analyst that determine how narrow or broad the transcript must be.
In this book we will use broad transcripts. Much more detail could be
offered for each transcript, but these details would end up being trees that
obscure the forest, and it is the forest we are after in this book. For more on
transcription in discourse analysis, see Duranti’s book in the Reading list on
page 5.
I use a good deal of data in this book and offer readers data to work on.
Data has to come from some place. The data here comes from my own work
which deals with social, institutional, and educational issues. I believe
discourse analysts ought to pick their questions and data because something
important bears on the answers they reach. In any case, readers will have
their own interests and the data here is for initial practice. Readers should
also apply all the tools we introduce to data and issues they have selected
and which interest them.
Not all readers will be equally familiar with the data I use. Though much of
the data is from the United States it is not even typical of everywhere in the
United States and may be more or less “foreign” even to people from there at
times. As you will learn later in this book—when we talk about making what
we take for granted “strange” and “new”—this is, in many ways, a good thing.
At the same time, readers should always think about how the data used in this
book could be supplemented by related data from their own area, culture, or
country where things may work differently. Readers then could compare and
contrast how things work in different cases. Indeed, this would make a good
assignment throughout the book.
My approach to discourse analysis is a type of “applied discourse analysis”
or “applied linguistics.” What does this mean? For me it means this: In areas
of empirical inquiry, there are a great many questions to ask, topics to study,
and many different types of data to collect. Since there are so many choices
here, why not choose questions, topics, and data that bear on issues and
problems important to people, society, and the world, rather than ones of less
importance? When we make choices based in part on how our inquiry will 
 4 Introduction
help speak to wider issues and problems, we are doing applied work. We do
not lower our empirical standards, nor do we politicize our work by drawing
conclusions more on the basis of desire than data. But we do seek to intervene.
You will see in this book that I chose language topics and data that bear on
pressing social, cultural, and institutional problems.
This book does not assume that readers know a lot about linguistics or
grammar. But I do assume that you will pay attention to the details of language.
The book is organized into four units each with a number of sections. Each
unit contains explanation and practice for the reader. Throughout the book I
also offer what I call “Grammar Interludes.” These interludes introduce basic
information about grammar as it plays a role in discourse analysis. Each
interlude also offers a tool and practice with the tool.
This book was inspired by a professor who told my publisher that she
used my book, An Introduction to Discourse Analysis: Theory and Method in
her class, but that she regretted that it did not tell readers how actually to do
a discourse analysis. And I cannot actually tell you “how to” in any full
detail. Like good science and good art, some of what it takes to do a good
discourse analysis involves things like taste, innovation, risk taking, and
good choices (and luck) about what to study. But this book is as close as I
can get. I give you specific things to do. I seek to immerse you in asking and
answering 28 questions. The questions are not easy and the answers are not
obvious. I hope you discuss them and argue over them with others (because
science is a social and collaborative enterprise). I hope, after your immersion,
you come out having discovered your own perspectives and skills, ready
both to learn more and to do your own work of understanding language in
the world.
While this book is about language, the tools it develops for analyzing
language work for analyzing static images (like a painting), moving or
changing images (like a film or video game), and so-called “multimodal” texts
that combine words and images and sometimes other modes like music (for
example, many ads and video games). This is so because discourse analysis is
about communication and, in most cases, images and multimodal texts are
seeking to communicate. They use a different “grammar” than does language
alone, but they communicate nonetheless. Applying discourse analysis to
images and multimodal texts is a very new enterprise and would require a
book of its own. Nonetheless, I encourage readers to think about how the
different tools in this book might apply outside language proper.
Note on Second Edition: This edition has added one more tool; deleted,
added, and corrected data; updated references (which has meant in some
cases adding more classics, not just recent work); and revised for clarity in
many places. An appendix on multimodal analysis has been deleted, since this
is a topic that deserves a fuller treatment than can be done in this book.
Note on Problems: This book has 51 “Problems” or assignments. It is a good
idea to ask students to find and bring in data that exemplifies the working of the 
 Introduction 5
various discourse tools discussed in this book. Teachers should also supply data
and problems that interest their class or that fit well with the backgrounds of the
students in their class. It is also a good idea to encourage students to use some
or all of the tools on data that they care about and can constitute the basis for
their own research. Discourse analysis, like all science, is a collaborative, social
endeavor and so students should practice collaborating on analyses, correcting,
supplementing, and adding to each other’s contributions.

1.1 Language and Language Acquisition
Dialects
We will start in this section with some very basic background about language.
People often think of grammar as rules that tell them how to speak “correctly.”
Speaking correctly is often taken to mean speaking in the way educated people
do. But this is not really how grammar works.
All human beings, barring serious problems, learn a native language as part
of their early socialization in life. Each person learns a certain variety—called
a “dialect”—of their native language, the variety their ancestors have passed
down to them. In the United States, they might learn Southern English,
African-American Vernacular English, New England English, or some other
dialect. Dialects can vary in terms of vocabulary, syntax, or pronunciation.
Of course, any region of the United States has people from other parts of the
country in it and so there are different varieties of English in any part of the
country. Dialects can vary by region (e.g., Southern English), social class (e.g.,
various working class dialects), and by cultural group (e.g., Appalachian
English). In many other countries, the differences between dialects are much
more dramatic than in the United States.
What people call “Standard English” is a rather “special” dialect. “Standard
English” is the variety of English that is held by many to be “correct” both in
the sense that it shows no strong regional variation and that it is used widely
in mainstream media and by public figures.
Standard English has its origins in the economic power of a fourteenthcentury merchant class in London, people who spoke an East Midland dialect.
Because of their growing economic clout, their dialect spread for public
business across the country. It became the basis of so-called “Received
Pronunciation” (“RP”) in England, and eventually gave rise to Standard
English in the United States.
Because of its prestige, many people in the United States speak Standard
English and pass on that variety to their children, even if earlier in their family
histories their ancestors spoke other dialects. For example, many Southerners
have given up their Southern dialect in favor of Standard English and speakers
of Appalachian Vernacular English or African-American Vernacular English
often adopt Standard English for job interviews and interactions within public
institutions.
Standard English is something of a fiction. We all speak it, if we do, in
somewhat different ways, as is true of all dialects. We all bring to it different
linguistic influences from other dialects and languages we know or which
are connected to our ancestors. Further, when we are speaking informally
(in our vernacular), we all use language forms that are not used in more
formal varieties of Standard English as it is used in mainstream media and in
writing.
Language and Context 9
Language Acquisition
For the most part, oral language acquisition for young children is an entirely
unconscious process. It does not require overt teaching or correction of any
sort. The process of early language acquisition is, at least in large part, under
biological control. Humans are creatures of language. They are born ready and
able to acquire some variety of a human language.
Young children do not need correction. When they say things like “go-ed”
instead of “went,” they often do not pay attention to correction even if they get
it from adults. They all end up eventually saying “went” as the past tense of
“go.” In fact, when children say “go-ed” instead of “went,” they show they are
catching on to the general pattern that English forms the past tense of verbs
by adding “ed” to a verb, but with some exceptions to the rule (as with
“went”). They are over-extending or over-generalizing the pattern, a common
occurrence in language acquisition. This shows that children are actively
looking for—making hypotheses about—rules or patterns. They are not just
memorizing what they hear.
The grammars of all dialects of all languages follow certain patterns that
are, partly at least, controlled by a human biological capacity for language.
The human brain sets certain constraints on what a human language can look
like and all dialects of all languages follow those basic constraints. Thus, no
dialect is “incorrect.” Dialects are just different from each other. They do vary,
of course, in prestige, thanks to how people think about their speakers and
their speakers’ social positions.
People often think a structure in a dialect is a mistake or “wrong” because it
is different from Standard English. For example, in African-American Vernacular
English, some speakers use a “naked be” form as in “My puppy, he always be
following me” or “We be having leftovers these days.” Since Standard English
does not use this form, many speakers of Standard English think it is incorrect.
They may even say that “People who speak that way don’t know English.”
However, the naked be form has a meaning. It is not a mistake. It is what
linguists call a “durative aspect marker,” that is, a form that means that an
action or event is a regular event, happens over and over, and is characteristic
or typical. Lot of languages have a durative aspect marker, even though
Standard English does not. This form was added to English by young AfricanAmerican children acquiring English and looking for a way to express durative
aspect. Throughout history, children have changed language as they acquire it
(that’s why, for example, Spanish and its mother language Latin are so different
from each other).
The linguist Noam Chomsky has famously argued that there is a biological
capacity for language that sets a basic design for all human languages and sets,
as well, parameters of how different languages can vary from this basic design.
Language is, thus, for humans, innate or an “instinct” (as is nest building or
song for some species of birds, who innately know what their nest or song is 
 10 Language and Context
like without having to learn it), at least in regard to the core or basic properties
of any language. In this sense, at a deep-seated level, all human languages
resemble each other in important ways.
According to this view, all varieties of language acquired by humans as
native (first) languages are equal, since they all fit the basic pattern or design
dictated by our human biological capacity for language. Chomsky’s views are
controversial. However, it is clear that all humans are born ready to learn
language and that human languages do not differ from each other in completely
arbitrary ways (i.e., there are language universals, such as the fact that all
language have nouns and verbs and subjects and objects).
Language changes all the time. Children change it when they are acquiring
it. For example, at one time in the history of English “apron” was said as
“nappron.” But children heard “a nappron” as “an apron.” Once a whole
generation said “apron” instead of “nappron,” the “correct” form was “apron.”
The “nappron” form can still be seen in the English word “napkin.” Adults
change language, as well, as they are influenced by other languages (e.g.,
bilinguals) or the need to communicate new things.
Speed and Clarity
Human languages must be both fast and clear. We humans want to be able to
communicate without undue slowdowns and yet we also want our
communications to be clear. These two demands can come into conflict with
each other. If we speak quickly and run our words together, communication
can get unclear. If we seek total clarity by spelling everything out explicitly,
communication can get too slow.
We can see in the history of languages the constant pressure to balance
speed and clarity. For example, Latin had “case endings” on its nouns.
Different endings on nouns indicated whether a noun was the subject of a
sentence or the direct object. So “puella” was the subject form of the word
“girl” and “puellam” was the direct object form. Latin had other case endings
for other grammatical relations. Because endings on the nouns indicated what
was subject and object, Latin did not have to use word order to indicate this
(as English does) and could vary word order pretty freely. Sentences like
“Puella amat puerum,” “Amat puella puerum,” and “Puella puerum amat”
(the girl loves the boy) were all grammatical.
Old English also had cases on its nouns, much like Latin. But, of course,
cases endings make words longer, more complex, and slower. So there is a
tendency for these case endings over long periods of time to “erode” (get
shorter) and finally disappear. This makes language quicker. But once case
endings are gone, there is no way to tell whether a noun like “girl” is being
used as a subject or object. So we have lost some clarity. English has lost case
endings on its nouns (though they are still on pronouns, as in “he” and “him,”
“she” and “her”). To indicate what is subject and what is object, English uses 
Language and Context 11
the word order “Subject Verb Object,” as in “The girl loves the boy,” and,
thus, has lost the word order freedom Latin had.
So far we are only talking about oral language, not written language. For
linguists, oral language is the fundamental form of language. Oral language
has been in human history since we became human (and maybe even before).
Oral language is part of human biology in the sense that we are certainly
creatures prepared and helped to learn oral language by our biology, that is,
by structures in our brains.
Written language is much newer in human history, at best it is about 10,000
years old. Not all cultures invented written language (in fact, most did not),
while all cultures have oral language today and have had it in the past. Written
language is not old enough in human evolutionary history to be part of human
biology.
Nonetheless, written language is, of course, an important form of language
and important in communication. We will deal with both oral and written
language in this book. By the way, American Sign Language counts as “oral
language,” even though it is signed, since it is acquired as a native language by
some children and used for face-to-face communication.

1.2 Context
Context and Cultural Knowledge
In the last section we argued that human languages must be both fast and
clear. We speakers face the trade-off between speed and clarity every day. 
 12 Language and Context
When we communicate we do not want to be too slow (or, worse, have our
listeners tell us to get on with it). Nor do we want to be unclear (or, worse,
have our listeners tell us they don’t know what we are talking about). We
always have to make a judgment about how much clarity we can sacrifice for
speed and how much speed we must give up to achieve an appropriate amount
of clarity for the context we are in.
In order to speed things along, any speaker leaves some things unsaid and
assumes they will be understood based on listeners’ knowledge of the context
in which the communication occurs. “Context” is a crucial term in discourse
analysis. What do we mean by it? For now, we will define “context” this way:
Context includes the physical setting in which the communication takes place
and everything in it; the bodies, eye gaze, gestures, and movements of those
present; what has previously been said and done by those involved in the
communication; and any shared knowledge those involved have, including
shared cultural knowledge.
Let’s for a moment think about just one aspect of context, namely shared
cultural knowledge. For example, in my cultural group, I assume people eat
dinner roughly between 6 and 8 o’clock at night. If I invite you out to dinner and
ask when you want to meet, I assume, without saying so explicitly, that you will
give me a time between 6 and 8. People in other cultures will vary about what
their taken for granted “normal” dinner times are. It is hard for us to see how
much shared cultural knowledge speakers assume and listeners bring to a
communication, since such shared knowledge is usually just taken-for-granted.
A Yucatan Example
Since shared cultural knowledge (one aspect of context) is so often taken for
granted, let’s look at a communication in what is a foreign culture to most of
us. Here we will not know what cultural information speakers assume can go
unsaid. My example is from William Hanks’ excellent book Language and
Communicative Practices (1996).
In a small town in Yucatan Mexico, a Mayan shaman named “Don Chabo”
is sharing a meal with his daughter-in-law, Margot, and a visiting
anthropologist. They are all in Margot’s house. A young man, named “Yuum,”
approaches from the outside. Standing at the window, he asks: “Is Don Chabo
seated?” Margot replies: “Go over there. He’s drinking. Go over there inside.”
The meaning of these utterances is not clear to cultural outsiders. A
tremendous amount of cultural knowledge has been taken for granted as
already known. For example, the people seated around the table are having a
meal, so why does Margo say that Don Chabo is “drinking”? Furthermore,
Margot’s response implies that Don Chabo is “drinking,” despite the fact that
he was, at the moment, gazing off into space with a roll in his hand. Indeed,
in Mayan, it would have been equally true here to say Don Chabo was
“drinking” had he been altogether done with (eating) his meal. 
Language and Context 13
Margot’s response implies, as well, that Don Chabo was “seated.” Yet, it
turns out, it would have been equally true to say he was “seated” had he been
standing or even off somewhere else, even taking a bath in his own home.
Or, to take one final example, Margot uses the Mayan word for “there” that
means “maximally distant from the speaker,” the same word people in Yucatan
use for relatives who live outside Yucatan in other states in the Mexican
republic. She does this despite the fact that she is telling Yuum to go into her
father-in-law’s house, not 10 meters away from hers and within the same
compound as her house.
How can it be that people can be “drinking” when they are eating or doing
nothing at all? That they are “seated” when they are standing or taking a bath?
That they are far distant from something 10 meters away?
Things work this way because Mayans (these Mayans, in any case), though
they almost always take food with drink and vice versa, use the words “drink”
and “eat” in such a way that their morning and evening meals are “drinking”
and their larger main meal in the midafternoon is “eating.” Furthermore, to
these Mayans, as long as the social engagement of mealtime is still going on,
regardless of whether the “meal” itself is finished or not, a person is still
“drinking” or “eating.”
Many Mayans live in walled compounds that contain several houses. They
use the word “seated” to mean that one is “at home” and available, regardless
of where one is in the compound. Being “available” has, in addition, a special
meaning for Shamans. To ask whether a Shaman is “at home” is to ask whether
he is available to engage in counseling.
Mayans have their own cultural views of how physical and social space
work and are related, as we all do. Margo is excluded from her father-in-law’s
house, unless she has a specific reason to be there, for social reasons having to
do with Mayan cultural views of social relationships and spaces within homes.
Thus, she uses the word for “far distant” due to social, rather than physical
distance.
In this brief example, I have given you very little of what you really need
to know to fully understand these simple utterances (for example, why does
Margot, rather than Don Chabo respond?). To really understand them one
needs to understand how social hierarchies, gender, meals, social
engagements, Shamanism, and a great deal more, work day-to-day in local
settings among (certain of the) Mayans. We all take for granted a good deal
of cultural knowledge. And, indeed, it is one goal of discourse analysis to
uncover and bring to conscious awareness such usually taken-for-granted
knowledge.
Making the Taken-for-Granted New and Strange
To do discourse analysis on our own languages in our own culture requires a
special skill. We have to make things new and strange that we usually see as 
 14 Language and Context
completely “normal” and “natural.” We can see the Mayan communication
above as “strange” because it is brand new to us.
To do discourse analysis, we have to see what is old and taken for granted
as if it were brand new. We need to come to see all the assumptions and
information speakers leave unsaid and assume listeners know and will add in
to make the communications clear. Communication and culture are like icebergs. Only a small “tip” is stated overtly. A vast amount lies under the surface,
not said, but assumed to be known or inferable from the context in which the
communication is occurring.
By making what is natural to us—what we usually take for granted—new
and strange, we can begin consciously to think about all the knowledge,
assumptions, and inferences we bring to any communication. And sometimes
we will even see aspects of our taken-for-granted cultural knowledge and
assumptions—or those of others—that we want to question because we
conclude they are doing harm to ourselves or others in terms of things like
equity, fairness, and humane treatment of people. What we do in
communication with each other is not always benign.

Grammar Interlude #1: Deixis
When Margo, in the example in Section 1.2, says “Go over there. He’s drinking.
Go over there inside,” she makes crucial use of words linguists refer to as
“deictics” (pointing words). Deictics are words whose reference must be
determined from context. Common deictics words fall into the categories of
(1) person (“I/me,” “you,” “he/him,” “she/her,” “we/us,” “they/them”); (2)
place (“here/there,” “this/that”); and (3) time (“now/then,” “yesterday/
today”). These words are also called “shifters” because their reference shifts
with each different context of use.
If I say “Brad Pitt likes chocolate cake,” you know from the words “Brad
Pitt,” “chocolate,” and “cake” what they refer to. But if I say, “He likes it,” you
have no idea who “he” refers to or what “it” refers to except by considering the
context either in terms of what was said previously or what and who are
present in the environment. When Margo says “Go over there. He’s drinking. 
Language and Context 15
Go over there inside,” the listener can only figure out what “over there” refers
to by a gesture and what “he” refers to by the previous mention of Don Chabo’s
name (as we pointed out in Section 1.2, Mayan has a word “there” that means
“close” and one that means “far”).
Deictics tie speech and writing to context. If listeners do not correctly figure
out what deictics refer to (using contextual information), then they do not
understand what is meant or they can misunderstand it. At the same time,
when speakers use deictics, they assume that their listeners can figure out
what the deictics refer to. For example, if I come up to you and say “She’s at it
again!,” I assume our previous talk about some woman and her antics (or
some obvious happening in the situation) are salient enough to you that I do
not need to name her.
However, the distinction between deictics like “this” and non-deictic words
like “cake” is, while clear in linguistics, not always all that clear when we get
to actual uses of language. For example, compare the following two utterances:
“John had been drinking, so I drove him home” and “John was drinking too
fast and dribbled it all down the front of his shirt.” In many contexts,
“drinking” in the first utterance will mean “drinking alcohol” and in the
second it could be any beverage. So even with non-deictic terms, there is often
an element of having to use context to figure out what words mean specifically.
To take another example, consider that in “The coffee spilled, go get a
mop,” we are talking about a liquid and in “The coffee spilled, go get a broom,”
we are talking about grains. It is the words “mop” and “broom” that serve as
the context that tells us what “coffee” means in these sentences specifically. In
an utterance like “The coffee spilled, clean it up” only the physical context or
something said previously would tell you what was meant specifically by
“coffee.”
This does not mean that words like “drink” and “coffee”—or that all words
(since for any word its specific meaning is determined from context)—are
deictics. Such content words do give us more contentful meaning to determine
what they refer to in context than do real deictics. But it does mean that in
actual use all language has deictic like properties.
The definite article in English (“the”) functions like a deictic. If I say to you
out of the blue “The woman is at it again!” instead of “She is at it again!,” in
both cases you have to figure out from interactions we have had previously
who “the woman” or “she” is referring to. The definite article (“the”) functions
like a deictic since it means that that the speaker assumes the listener already
knows (from context or previous knowledge) what the noun phrase it is in
refers to. The indefinite article (“a,” “an”) does not have such a deictic
function. If I say “A woman came in,” I am not assuming the listener already
knows who I am referring to. If I say “The woman came in,” I am assuming the
listener does already know who I am referring to or can figure it out.
We will now introduce the Deixis Tool. This tool serves as one important
aid in using the Filling Out Tool we will introduce in Section 1.3.
 16 Language and Context
Tool #1: The Deixis Tool
For any communication, ask how deictics are being used to tie what is said to
context and to make assumptions about what listeners already know or can
figure out. Consider uses of the definite article in the same way. Also ask what
deictic like properties any regular words are taking on in context, that is, what
aspects of their specific meanings need to be filled in from context (we will see
this latter task again later in the Situated Meaning Tool in Section 4.2).
Problem 1
Below is some data that you will see again in Section 1.4. A teacher is telling a
group of people about an episode where an administrator (Mary Washington)
at her school told her to call an historian (Sara) from a local university
(Woodson). The historian wanted to work with teachers and schools in her
town to have children do oral history about their town (i.e., interview people
about the past) and other sorts of history. The teacher (Karen) uses the deictic
“here” because the meeting is being held at her school. All names of people
and places have been changed. Read the data and answer the questions that
follow it.
In the transcript below, when words are capitalized it means they were said
with emphatic stress, that is, they were emphasized. The symbol “//” means
what precedes it was said with what we will call a “final intonation contour”
(which is sort of like a period in speech). The symbol “/” means what precedes
it was said with what we will call a “non-final intonation contour” (which is
sort of like a comma in speech). We will discuss intonation in Grammar
Interlude #3 (after Section 1.5). Right now the details are not important.
By the way, when using transcriptions of oral data, be sure to say it out loud
as you seek to reflect on what it means. So, now read out loud the data below:
LAST YEAR /
Mary Washington /
who is our curriculum coordinator here /
had a call from Sara //
at Woodson //
And called me /
and said (pause) /
“We have a person from Woodson /
who’s in the History Department /
she’s interested in doing some RESEARCH /
into BLACK history //
And she would like to get involved with the school /
And here’s her number /
Give her a call” //
Language and Context 17
Questions:
1. List all the deictics in this data and say what you think they mean and
how the listeners might have figured out what they mean.
2. In the direct quote Karen ascribes to Mary Washington, what is the
meaning of the deictic “we” in “we have a person …”? Is the “we” here
the royal “we” (so Mary Washington really means only herself)? Does it
refer to Mary and Karen? Does it refer to the school as an institution and
the people in it? Is it ambiguous? Does this “we” include Sara? What do
you think Karen is trying to accomplish with this use of “we”?
3. Why didn’t Karen say “There is a person from Woodson …” instead of “We
have a person from Woodson”? By the way, a year later it is unlikely Karen
remembers the exact words Mary used and, in any case, when speakers
quote others they often ascribe words to them that were not actually said
but which capture what the speaker herself means and wants to accomplish.
4. When you get to this data again (with the rest of what Karen said) in
Section 1.4, return to these questions about “we” and consider how your
answers would then fit with your larger analysis of the data at that point.
5. Proper names (like Sara, Mary Washington, and Woodson) are not deictics,
since they do not switch their meanings in different contexts. However, proper
names do not carry much contentful meaning the way “content words” like
“school” and “number” do. How could the people hearing this data have
known who Mary Washington is, who Sara is, and what Woodson is?
6. The word “number” in the data above is neither a deictic nor a proper
name, but a content word (a noun) with fuller, more contentful meaning
(something like a definition) than either a deictic or a proper name.
However, this word can have somewhat different specific meanings in
different contexts. What is its specific meaning here and how do listeners
know what this specific meaning is?

1.3 Two Tools: The Fill In Tool and the Making Strange Tool
Communication and Context
Below I sketch out the picture of communication and context we have
developed thus far. We will revise it somewhat later, but it is suitable for our
purposes now:
 18 Language and Context
WHAT THE SPEAKER SAYS + CONTEXT = WHAT THE SPEAKER MEANS

The physical setting in which the communication takes place and everything in it;
the bodies, eye gaze, gestures, and movements of those present; what has
previously been said and done by those involved in the communication; any
shared knowledge those involved have, including shared cultural knowledge
LISTENER’S WORK = Consider what the speaker has said and the context in
which it has been said. On that basis make the assumptions and draw the
inferences that will make what the speaker has said clear and complete. I will
call this work, the “Filling In Task,” because the listener is using what is said
and the context in which it is said to fill in or complete what the speaker has
said, since speakers always leave a good deal unsaid (but assume it to be
known or inferable by listeners).
Tools
So far in our discussion of language and context we have developed the basis
for two new tools for discourse analysis. The first tool we will call the “Fill In
Tool” and the second we will call the “Making Strange Tool.” These tools are
related. The Making Strange Tool helps us use the Fill In Tool.
Tool #2: The Fill In Tool
For any communication, ask: Based on what was said and the context in which
it was said, what needs to be filled in here to achieve clarity? What is not being
said overtly, but is still assumed to be known or inferable? What knowledge,
assumptions, and inferences do listeners have to bring to bear in order for this
communication to be clear and understandable and received in the way the
speaker intended it?
There are ways of being a “resistant listener” (or “resistant reader”).
Resistant listeners purposely refuse to make and “buy into” the taken-forgranted knowledge, assumptions, and inferences a speaker intends
listeners to make. For example, the speaker might be a racist, asking us to
assume that whites are superior to others. However, it is hard to truly
understand people—even if we want to oppose them—if we do not first try
to get at their underlying assumptions and the reasons they believe and act
as they do. This can be very hard to do if we profoundly object to their
viewpoints, yet, nonetheless, it makes eventual resistant listening deeper
and fairer. 
Language and Context 19
Tool #3: The Making Strange Tool
For any communication, try to act as if you are an “outsider.” Ask yourself:
What would someone (perhaps, even a Martian) find strange here (unclear,
confusing, worth questioning) if that person did not share the knowledge and
assumptions and make the inferences that render the communication so natural
and taken-for-granted by insiders?

Formalist criticism: Four essays, pp. 3–24. Omaha, NE: University of Nebraska Press
[An important essay in which the notion of “making strange” and its role in art are
introduced.]
1.4 Working with the Fill In Tool
Here we consider some data and put the Fill In Tool to use. I will give you
only a little information about the context in which the data occurred. Then I
will ask you to think about some questions. These questions are meant to help
you think about what you need to know in order to make sense of the data.
They are meant to help you think about what you need to “fill in” that is not
explicitly said, based on what was said and what you know or can surmise
about the context.
I want you to think about the information you need to have (and some of which
you may not have in this case), the assumptions you need to make, and the
inferences you need to draw to make sense of the communication. Where you do
not fully know the context, you have to make guesses about what the context was,
based on what was said and your own personal knowledge. This is not an
uncommon occurrence even in everyday life, let alone for us discourse analysts.
Your task as a discourse analyst and the listeners’ task are similar. The
listeners involved in the communication transcribed below needed to draw on
certain parts of their knowledge, make certain assumptions, and draw certain
inferences to make sense in real time of what they were hearing (based on
what was said and the context in which it was said). However, these processes,
for them, were, for the most part, unconscious, accomplished rapidly (speech
is fast and vanishes quickly), and without much time for reflection. Your
analysis of the data will, of course, be conscious and you will have time for
reflection. Nonetheless, in your analysis, you will be seeking, in part, to
uncover what any listener would have to know, assume, and infer to
understand this communication.
It is important to understand that when I say we are trying to understand
what someone meant, I mean we are trying to figure out what they were trying 
 20 Language and Context
to say, what their intentions were, and what goals or purposes they were
trying to achieve. We are using the term “meaning” in a quite broad sense.
Of course, we can never be completely sure of people’s intentions and
purposes, not even our own at times. There is much that goes on in people’s
minds that is unconscious. Furthermore, even we ourselves are not completely
consciously aware of our own reasons, purposes, and intentions. We can
discover things about these by talking to others or reflecting on what we have
said and done. Nonetheless, both everyday people and discourse analysts do
the best they can, make the best and most informed “guesses” they can about
meaning.
There is an interesting wrinkle in the data below. There was a group of
people listening to this communication. They had different backgrounds and
they did not all know the same things. Of course, this is common in life today,
where we often communicate with diverse sorts of people. Thus, these people
did not all look at the context in the same way. For example, they did not all
completely share the same cultural knowledge that the speaker possessed (for
example, differences between “teacher culture” and the culture of university
academics caused certain conflicts in the project from which the data below
came).
Some of the people in the group were in much better shape than others in
the group to “fill in” fully the information, assumptions, and inferences the
speaker intended them to. The speaker, of course, was aware of this. Like all
speakers would, she took it into consideration and, in fact, at points took
advantage of the situation. She was communicating—and probably knew she
was communicating—somewhat different things to different people in the
room based on how much knowledge and culture they shared with her. The
speaker is an elementary school teacher and she knows very well the other
teachers in the room will be able to do more “filling in” (e.g., recruit more
culturally shared background knowledge) than the people in the room who
are not teachers.
So this makes the situation complex. As a discourse analyst you want to
uncover this complexity. This speaker, like all speakers, is by no means just
communicating information. She is also doing other sorts of work, as well,
work that involves attempting to create, transform, and negotiate social
relationships among the people in the group. We will discuss this sort of work
later in this book. For now, “fill in” the best you can and think about what
different people in the group brought to the communication (in terms of what
they did or did not share with the speaker). Think about what different people
in the group might have made of the communication and the speaker’s
purposes.
So here is a little context for the data to follow: A Research Institute
connected to Woodson University (all names have been changed to fictitious
names) is working with Sara, a history professor at the university. She wants
to work with some local schools to help teachers get their middle school 
Language and Context 21
students engaged in doing history by studying their own neighborhoods and
town (Middleview). The students will engage in things like interviewing older
people and looking at census track data.
A meeting has been called. In attendance are: a few teachers from two
schools; Sara and two of her students; a representative from the Institute
(herself a university academic); an administrator from one of the schools; and
two curriculum consultants from a local history museum. The representative
from the Research Institute is chairing the meeting. Since she knows there has
been some contact prior to the meeting between Sara and one of the schools,
as well as activity around the project, she asks one of the teachers from that
school, Karen, to update the group on what has already happened prior to the
meeting. Below is reprinted just a part of what Karen said, the beginning part.
The transcript below uses certain conventions, not all of which are relevant
right now. A “/” indicates an intonation contour that is heard as “non-final”
(more is to come). A “//” indicates an intonation contour that is heard as
“final” (closed off, what comes next is separate information, often information
that might be in a different sentence in a written text). In real speech, final
intonation contours sometimes occur at points that would not be the ends of
sentences in a written text. We will look at these matters later and their details
need not now be relevant.
When a word is capitalized in the transcript below that means it has been
said with what is called “emphatic stress.” It is said with emphasis (indicated
either by extra loudness or a pitch change). Right now, just take it that such
words are emphasized. Listeners have to “guess” why they are emphasized,
since Karen does not explicitly say why. This is part of what listeners have to
add to Karen’s communication in order to make its meaning clear.
LAST YEAR /
Mary Washington /
who is our curriculum coordinator here /
had a call from Sara //
at Woodson //
And called me /
and said (pause) /
“We have a person from Woodson /
Who’s in the History Department /
she’s interested in doing some RESEARCH /
into BLACK history //
And she would like to get involved with the school /
And her number /
Give her a call” //
And we- I DID call her /
And we um BOTH expected /
to be around /
for the summer institute //
at Woodson //
 22 Language and Context
I DID /
ah participate in it /
But SARA /
Wasn’t able to do THAT //
(Sara tries unsuccessfully to interrupt)
Problem 2
You know only a very little about the context of this language. Based on just
what you know (not just what I have told you, but also your own knowledge)
and the language in the transcript, answer the questions below. The point here
is to see and reflect on what sorts of things you need to add to the language to
gain clarity (what sorts of inferences or guesses you need to make; what
knowledge you need to bring to bear; what assumptions you must make—all
of which are not overtly said in the communication). The point here, also, is
to consider, as I later tell you more about the context of this communication,
how what you make of the communication (what you take it to mean) changes
as you learn more about the context.
Don’t bother being timid, feel free to make guesses and go out on a limb.
We will see later that it is all right to be bold when making guesses about
meaning when you are doing discourse analysis. The point here is not to “be
right,” but to begin to reflect on the processes by which we humans give
meaning to language in use.
Questions:
1. Everyone in the meeting knew Sara was from Woodson University (they
had done introductions before Karen spoke). So why does Karen say this
explicitly?
2. Why does Karen use Mary Washington’s full name, but only Sara’s first
name (Sara is a tenured professor at the University)?
3. Why is the content of the call from Sara given as a direct quotation and
not just summarized (as in “Mary Washington said Sara wanted to get
involved with the school and that I should call her”)?
4. Why is there emphasis on “last year”?
5. Why is there emphasis on “research” and “Black”?
6. Why is there emphasis on “did” (call her), “both,” “did” (participate),
“Sara,” and “that”?
7. Why did Sara try to interrupt at just the point she did?
8. What in the language tells you that Karen is probably angry or perturbed
by something Sara has done?
9. What do you think Sara did that angered or perturbed Karen?
10. What other aspects of context, if any, do you need to know in order to
clarify what Karen means and intends?
Language and Context 23
11. Do you need know who in the room is African-American, who is White,
and who is something else in order to fully understand what Karen means
and what she trying to accomplish? Do you need to know whether Mary
Washington is African-American, White, or something else? Karen? Sara?
Anyone else?
12. Karen later says that after talking to Sara, she went to a friend and
colleague, Jane, and asked her to get involved with the history project. So
at that point there were three people involved with the project: Karen,
Sara, and Jane. Karen then says:
Well at that point there were three of us (laughs) //
back in the SUMMER //
And all three of us had not yet /
met together //
Does what Karen says here bear on the answer to any of the questions
above (could be more than one)?
These questions are meant to give you a feel for how the Fill In Tool works.
Using that tool, you ask what information, assumptions, and inferences are
needed for understanding not just what people mean in any narrow sense, but
what they are trying to accomplish with their language, what their purposes
are, what they are trying to do (all of which are really part of meaning in one
sense of the term, as we will see later in this book).
The data and questions above, hopefully, show you that the “Fill In” task
isn’t easy, either for listeners or us discourse analysts. Lots of questions and
issues come up. Everyday people, as they are communicating with each other,
usually do not have time to pursue these questions and issues and consciously
reflect on them. Sometimes, though, they interrupt (as Sara tried to do) and
try to raise some of them overtly (as Sara would certainly have tried to do had
she gotten to speak). And sometimes not raising them gets people into trouble
later (as happened in this project, when questions and issues that may well
have arisen for you as you thought about this data were later overtly raised by
participants in the project as, over time, they ceased to understand each
other).
Grammar Interlude #2: Subjects and Predicates
All languages in the world are organized grammatically around the basic
structure of subjects and predicates. Languages have different ways of
indicating what the subject of a sentence is. Some use special marks (“cases”)
on the ends of nouns to indicate when the noun is a subject (e.g., “puer,”
“boy,” as subject in Latin) and when it is a direct object (e.g., “puerum,”
“boy,” as direct object in Latin) (note in English “he” for subjects and “him” 
 24 Language and Context
for objects). Other endings are used for other grammatical roles beyond
subject and object.
In English we use word order to indicate what the subject is and what the
object is by placing the subject before the verb and the object after the verb.
Furthermore, the subject agrees with main verbs in the present tense, as in
“The girl leaves today” (singular subject, present tense verb) and “The girls
leave today” (plural subject, present tense verb). The verb “to be” agrees with
its subject in both present and past: “The girl is good,” “The girls are good,”
“The girl was good,” “The girls were good.”
In a sentence, a verb links the subject (which is always a noun or a noun
phrase) to other elements, such as objects (e.g., “Mary loves the man”),
complements (e.g., Mary thinks that the boy left home”), prepositional
phrases (e.g., “Mary went to the park,” “Mary saw the man in the park”) or
other things (e.g., “The students elected John President,” where “President” is
called a “predicate nominal”). The verb “to be” is called the copula and links
subject to nouns or noun phrases (“Mary is a woman,” “Mary is the oldest
woman”) and adjectives or adjective phrases (“Mary is tall,” “Mary is very tall
for a woman”).
The predicate is the verb and anything following it that the verb links to the
subject. Below I have underlined the predicates:
1. Mary loves the man
2. Mary saw the man in the park
3. Mary is the oldest woman in the university
4. The young woman gave the boy a gift yesterday
5. Mary has a hat on her head
The subject of a sentence is “what we are talking about” and we will call it the
“topic” of the sentence. The subject is the center of attention, the point around
which information is organized. The predicate is “what we are saying about
it.” The predicate gives information about the subject.
Thus, if I say “Stanford admitted my daughter,” I have chosen “Stanford” as
the topic, center of attention, and the point around which I am organizing the
information in the sentence. If, on the other hand, I say “My daughter was
admitted to Stanford” I have chosen “my daughter” as topic, center of
attention, and the point around which I am organizing the information in the
sentence. The two sentences say much the same thing, but organize the
information differently.
Once a speaker has introduced a topic, if he or she wants to keep talking
about it, the topic is referred back to via a pronoun as in: “Stanford
admitted my daughter. They are lucky to have her” or “My daughter was
admitted by Stanford. She is really thrilled.” A good deal of everyday
speech is made up of an utterance with a full noun phrase subject followed
by a number of utterances whose subjects are pronouns referring back to 
Language and Context 25
that full noun phrase. In this way, speakers can “chain” on a topic and
keep talking about it.
Speakers choose subjects strategically to set up how listeners should
organize information in their heads and how listeners should view whatever
the speaker is talking about. For example, in the data we saw in Section 1.4,
we saw the following sentence:
1. Mary Washington who is our curriculum coordinator here had a call from
Sara at Woodson.
The speaker could have said instead:
2. Sara who is at Woodson had called Mary Washington.
In (1) “Mary Washington who is our curriculum coordinator here” is the
subject and topic; in (2) “Sara who is at Woodson” is. Going back to the data
in Section 1.4, reflect on why the speaker may have made the choice she did
(i.e., using “Mary Washington who is our curriculum coordinator” and not
“Sara who is at Woodson” as the subject/topic).
Looking at how subjects are chosen and what speakers choose to say about
them is one key grammatical tool in discourse analysis:
Tool #4: The Subject Tool
For any communication, ask why speakers have chosen the subject/topics
they have and what they are saying about the subject. Ask if and how they
could have made another choice of subject and why they did not. Why are
they organizing information the way they are in terms of subjects and
predicates?

1.5 Working with the Making Strange Tool
When we do discourse analysis we are often dealing with data “after the fact,”
when a communication is over and done with. Thus, we have to reconstruct
the context as far as we can. We have a recording of the data, of course. But
that recording gives very little of the full context, even if it is a video. We have 
 26 Language and Context
to reconstruct as much of the context as we can from notes, interviews, other
data, and research.
We argued in Section 1.2 above that when we are dealing with a familiar
culture, we have a problem of taking too much for granted. We often miss
how much work we and other people like us are doing filling in from context
things that the speaker has left unsaid. Thus, we discourse analysts have to
learn to make what we take for granted new and strange. This is why it is
sometimes good, when doing discourse analysis, for an insider and outsider to
study the same data together.
Below is data from a setting with which some readers will be familiar and
some unfamiliar. A teacher and a first-grade child are engaged in “sharing
time” (sometimes also called “show-and-tell time” or “rug time”). In this
classroom—and many others—at the beginning of the school day, the children
take turns sharing something with the class. In this case, Mindy is sharing
about making candles.
The teacher is sitting close to Mindy, who is standing. The teacher has her
arm around Mindy. The teacher interrupts Mindy at several points, as she
does all the children when they are sharing. Mindy is not bothered at all by the
teacher’s interruptions. In fact, the two are quite in synch or in rhythm with
each other, like a good dance team.
If you are unfamiliar with elementary classrooms and sharing time, then
you are an outsider to this data. You may see things as strange that insiders do
not. That is good.
If you are very familiar with elementary school and sharing time, then you
are an insider to this data. You may miss things, seeing them as “natural”
and normal and not worth commenting on. At the same time, you have a
much deeper knowledge of the context and so can sometimes make better
judgments about what things mean and why they are being done as they are
(if you can bring your unconscious and taken-for-granted knowledge to
consciousness).
The outsider can help the insider see old things as new and strange again.
The insider can help the outsider use context more deeply to correct judgments
about meaning and purposes being pursued.
If you are an insider to the data below and do not have an outsider to work
with, you have to learn to look at the data the way an outsider would. You
need to see it in a way that lets you see how it could be seen as strange by
people to whom it is new. That way you can explicate how meaning is being
made and what actions and purposes are being accomplished through the
language being used.
If you are an outsider to the data below and you do not have an insider to
work with, you have to make guesses and pursue some research. You might
have to ask people about what goes on in schools and elementary classrooms.
Right now it is also fine, if you can’t do this research, for you to make guesses
and to reflect on what might be strange in the data. What you find strange as 
Language and Context 27
an outsider may well be things that would seem natural to insiders as they
apply their insider knowledge.
Whether you are an insider or an outsider in regard to this data, your
assignment here is to make it strange. Let me point out that a good deal of
research has been done on sharing time. That research has discovered that
teachers are not always fully aware of all they are doing and why they are
doing it when they are engaged in sharing time. As teachers have helped with
such research, read it later, or done their own research, they have sometimes
discovered for themselves aspects of what they mean and why they are doing
what they are doing. This is true of all of us. We are not consciously aware of
all we mean and of all our motives. We can discover new things about ourselves
when others study us or we consciously reflect, after action, on what we have
said and done.
When I first saw the data below, I knew absolutely nothing about schools. I
found this data and other sharing time data quite strange. Just one example:
Why does the teacher offer Mindy the false answer “flour”? Indeed, why does
she interrupt Mindy and the other children at all?
As I said above, when the teacher interrupts students like Mindy, the child
is not bothered or disrupted. This is not so for some (but not all) of the
African-American children in this teacher’s class and in other classrooms
where teachers have behaved in similar ways. Here teacher and student are
not in synch. In these cases, the teacher seems to interrupt at the wrong places
and the child is disrupted in his or her talk. That seems strange, doesn’t it?
Problem 3
So go through the data and point to aspects of the data that an outsider might
find strange, worth commenting on, or worth asking about. You are primarily
going to be looking at how the teacher interacts with the child. Then
hypothesize what the teacher means and what she is trying to accomplish
moment by moment. When you are done, consider the following question:
What do you think the overall purpose of sharing time is for this teacher and
others like her?

 we made these /

things that are strange. Here the cigarette company is trying to get us to see
cigarettes in a new way, trying to get us to begin to take for granted a new way

How would they like us to see their new cigarette in particular and cigarettes

Grammar Interlude #3: Intonation
This section deals with a few aspects of how speech is produced and what this has
to do with the sorts of meanings we speakers hope to convey and that we hearers
(always actively and creatively) try to “recover” or fill in. Thanks to the way the
human brain and vocal system is built, speech is produced in small spurts. These
spurts each have their own intonation contour (see below) and often are preceded
and/or followed by slight pauses. Unless we pay close attention, we don’t usually
hear these little spurts, because our ear puts them together and gives us the illusion
of speech being an unbroken and continuous stream. In English, these spurts are
often, though not always, one “clause” long. The spurts have been called “tone
units,” “idea units,” or “lines.” Here I will use the term “idea units.”
In a rough and ready way we can define a “clause” as any verb and the
elements that “cluster” with it. So in a sentence like “Mary left the party
because she was tired,” we have two clauses, “Mary left the party” (“Mary”
and “the party” cluster with the verb “left”) and “because she was tired” (“she”
clusters with the very “was tired”). The sentence “Mary left the party” contains
only one clause. In a sentence like “Mary intended to leave the party,” we have
two clauses, “Mary intended” and “to leave the party” (where “Mary” is
understood as the subject of “to leave”). Here the second clause (“to leave the
party”) is embedded in the first clause (“Mary intended”) as the direct object
of the verb “intend.” These two clauses are so tightly bound together that they
would most often be said as a single spurt of speech.
In the example below, taken from a story told by a seven-year-old AfricanAmerican child at sharing time, each speech spurt is one clause long, except 2
and 5 where the child has detached parts of clauses to be spurts on their own
(of course, children’s speech units tend to be shorter than adults). Each spurt
is one idea and each spurt contains one piece of new information:
1. there was a hook
2. on the top of the stairway
3. an’ my father was pickin me up
4. an’ I got stuck on the hook
5. up there
6. an’ I hadn’t had breakfast
7. he wouldn’t take me down
8. until I finished all my breakfast
9. cause I didn’t like oatmeal either
 30 Language and Context
To understand how these spurts work in English (they work differently in
different languages), we need to discuss a set of closely interrelated linguistic
concepts: function words, content words, information, stress, and intonation.
We will start with the distinction between function words and content words.
Content words (sometimes also called “lexical words”) belong to the major
parts of speech: nouns, verbs, and adjectives. These categories are said to be
“open categories” in the sense that they each have a large number of members
and languages readily add new members to these categories through borrowing
from other languages or the invention of new words.
Function words (also sometimes called “grammatical words”) belong to
smaller categories, categories which are said to be “closed categories” in the
sense that each category has relatively few members and languages are resistant
to borrowing or inventing anew such words (though they sometimes do).
Such categories as determiners (e.g., “the,” “a/n,” “this/that,” “these/those”—
these are also sometimes called “articles”), pronouns (e.g. “he/him,” “she/
her,” “it,” “himself,” “herself”), prepositions (e.g., “in,” “on,” “to,” “of”), and
quantifiers (e.g., “some,” “many,” “all,” “none”) are function word categories.
Function words show how the content words in a phrase, clause, or sentence
relate to each other, or how pieces of information fit into the overall ongoing
communication. For example, the definite determiner “the” signals that the
information following it is already “known” to the speaker and hearer.
Pronouns signal that their referents have been previously mentioned, or are
readily identifiable in the context of communication or on the basis of the
speaker and hearer’s mutual knowledge. Prepositions link nouns and noun
phrases to other words (e.g., in “lots of luck” of links luck to lots; in “ideas in
my mind,” in links my mind to ideas; and in “look at the girl,” at links the girl
to the verb look). I have not yet mentioned adverbs. Adverbs are messy and
complicated. Very often they function in a way that is midway between a
function word and a content word.
Since function words carry less of the real content of the communication
(their job being to signal the grammar of the sentence), we can say that they
tend to be informationally less salient than content words. While they are
certainly helpful, they are often dispensable, as anyone who has written a
telegram knows (if there is anyone left who has!).
Thus, let us make a distinction between two types of information in a
sentence. First, information that is relatively new and relatively unpredictable
I will call “informationally salient.” The actual specific meaning of any content
word in a sentence is unpredictable without knowing exactly what the content
word means. If a content word is left out of a sentence it is often hard to
predict what it would have been. Thus, content words are usually
informationally more salient than function words.
Second, information that is given, assumed already known, or predictable,
I will call “informationally less salient.” Very often even if you have not heard
a function word you could pretty well predict where it should have been and 
Language and Context 31
what word exactly it would have been. For example, if you heard “Boy has lots
ideas,” you could predict that “the” is missing in front of “boy,” and “of”
between “lots” and “ideas.” If, however, you heard “That man has lots of,” you
could not predict what content word should come after “of.” Thus, function
words are usually informationally less salient than content words.
In general, then, the content word-function word distinction is a distinction
between two types of information. However, beyond this gross dichotomy, the
distinction between information that is more or less salient is one that can
only be drawn in the actual context of communication. We turn to this matter
now.
Information saliency in English is marked by stress. In turn, the different
stress patterns in a spurt of speech set up its intonational contour. To see what
these terms mean, consider the little dialogue below:
Speaker A: Have you read any good books lately?
Speaker B: Well, I read a shocking book recently. [Goes on to describe the book.]
How speaker B crafts her response is partially set up by the remark made by
speaker A, which here represents part of the context in which B’s response
occurs. Let’s think a moment about how the utterance uttered by B might have
been said. English speakers mark the information saliency of a word by how
much stress they give the word.
Stress is a psychological concept, not a physical one. English speakers can
(unconsciously) use and hear several different degrees of stress in a speech
spurt, but this is not physically marked in any uniform and consistent way.
Stress is physically marked by a combination of increased loudness, increased
length, and by changing the pitch of one’s voice (raising or lowering the
pitch, or gliding up or down in pitch) on a word’s primary (“accented”)
syllable. Any one or two of these can be used to trade off for the others in a
quite complicated way.
In any case, English speakers unconsciously use and recognize stress, and it
can be brought to conscious awareness with a little practice (some people are
better than others at bringing stress differences to consciousness awareness,
though we can all unconsciously use and recognize it). A word with more
stress than another word sounds more salient (it often sounds louder, though
it may not really be louder, but just be longer or have a pitch change on it,
both of which will make English speakers think it sounds louder).
So let’s return to speaker B’s response and assume it was said as one spurt
of speech. It’s first word, “well,” can be said with little stress, on a relatively
low pitch and/or with little loudness, since it carries no content, but simply
links speaker’s B turn to speaker A’s. This is not to say that words like “well”
are not important in other ways; such words, in fact, have interesting discourse
functions in helping to link and package information across sentences. Since
“well” is the first word of speaker B’s spurt of speech, and starts her turn, it 
 32 Language and Context
will be said on a pitch that is taken to be close to the “basic pitch” at which
speaker B will be speaking (perhaps, kicked up a bit from B’s basic pitch and,
too, from where speaker A left off, to mark B’s turn as beginning).
“I” is completely predictable in the context of the question speaker A has
asked, and it is a function word. Thus, it is not very salient informationally
and will receive little stress, just enough loudness to get it said and with a
pitch close to the basic pitch speaker B has chosen (for this spurt or related
run of spurts as she keeps speaking). The content word “read” is predicable
because it has already occurred in speaker A’s preceding question. So, too, for
the word “book” later in B’s remark. Both of these words will have a fairly low
degree of stress. They will have more than the function words “well,” “I,” and
“a,” since as content words they do carry content, but certainly much less than
the word “shocking” which carries new and non-redundant information. The
indefinite article “a,” of course, is informationally very unsalient and will get
little stress. The speaker will mark what stress words like “read” and “book”
have by bumping the pitch of her voice a bit up or down from the “basic pitch”
she has established or is establishing and/or by increasing loudness a bit
relative to words like “I” and “a.”
On the other hand, the word “shocking” is the most unpredictable,
informationally salient, new information in the sentence. The speaker will
mark this saliency by giving this word the most stress in the sentence. Such a
word or phrase, which carries the greatest degree of stress in a sentence (or a
given spurt of speech) is marked not just by bumping the pitch of the voice up
or down a bit and/or by increasing loudness, but by a real pitch movement
(called a “glide”).
The speaker begins to glide the pitch of her voice up or down (or even upthen-down or down-then-up) on the word “shocking,” allowing the pitch
movement to continue to glide up or down (whichever she has chosen) on the
words that follow it, here “book” and “recently.” Of course, what sort of pitch
movement the speaker chooses, that is, whether up, down, up-then-down, or
down-then-up, has a meaning (for example, the speaker’s pitch glide rises in
certain sorts of questions and falls in certain sorts of statements). We are not
now concerned, however, with these meaning differences.
The pitch glide which begins on the word “shocking” marks “shocking” as
the focus of the intonation unit. An “intonation unit” is all the words that
precede a pitch glide and the words following it over which the glide continues
to move (fall or rise). The next intonation unit begins when the glide is
finished. The speaker often hesitates a bit between intonation units (usually
we pay no attention to these hesitations) and then steps the pitch up or down
a bit from the basic pitch of the last intonation unit on the first word of the
next unit (regardless of whether it is a content word or not) to “key” the
hearer that a new intonation unit is beginning.
In B’s response to A, the content word “recently” is fairly redundant (not
too salient) because, while it has not been mentioned in A’s question, it is 
Language and Context 33
certainly implied by A’s use of the word “lately.” Thus, it receives about as
much stress, or, perhaps a little more, than the content words “read” and
“book.” The speaker may increase her loudness a bit on “recently” and/or
bump the pitch of her voice up or down a bit on its main syllable (i.e., “cent”)
as her pitch continues basically to glide up or down over “recently” as part of
(and the ending of) the pitch glide started on the word “shocking.”
Below, I give a visual representation of how speaker B might have said his
utterance:
 shock
 ing
 read book cent
Well re
 I a ly
There are, of course, other ways to have said this utterance, ways which carry
different nuances of meaning.
There is one last important feature of English intonation to cover here. In
English, if the intonation focus (the pitch glide) is placed on the last content
word of a phrase (say on “flower” in the phrase “the pretty red flower”),
then the salient, new information is taken to be either just this word or the
material in the phrase as a whole (thus, either just “flower” or the whole
phrase “the pretty red flower”). Of course, the context will usually determine
which is the case. If the intonation focus (pitch glide) is placed on a word
other than the last word in the phrase, then that word is unequivocally taken
to be the salient, new information (e.g., if the intonation focus is on “red” in
“the pretty red flower,” then the salient, new information is taken to be just
“red”). In our example above, “shocking” is not the last word in its phrase
(it is an adjective in a noun phrase “a shocking book”) and, thus, is
unequivocally the new, salient information.
An interesting situation arises when the intonation focus (pitch glide) is
placed in the last (content) word in a sentence. Then, we cannot tell whether the
salient, new information the speaker is trying to indicate is just that word or also
other words that precede it and go with it in the phrase or phrases to which it
belongs. So in an utterance like “This summer, Mary finished fifteen books,” if
the speaker starts her glide on “books,” the new salient information she intends
to mark may be just “books” (answering a question like “Mary finished fifteen
whats?”), or “fifteen books” (“What has Mary finished?”), since “books” is part
of the noun phrase “fifteen books.” The new salient information could even be
“finished fifteen books,” since these words constitute together a verb phrase
ending with, and containing, the word “book” (What has Mary done?”). In fact,
since “books” is the last word of the sentence, everything in the sentence could
be taken to be new and salient (“What happened?”). Of course, in actual
contexts it becomes clearer what is and what is not new and salient information. 
 34 Language and Context
Ultimately, the context in which an utterance is uttered, together with the
assumptions that the speaker makes about the hearer’s knowledge, usually
determines the degrees of informational saliency for each word and phrase in
a sentence. Speakers, however, can also choose to downplay or play up the
information saliency or importance of a word or phrase and ignore aspects of
the context or what they assume the hearer to know already. This is part of
how speakers actively create or manipulate contexts, rather than just simply
respond to them. Of course, if speakers take this too far, they can end up
saying things that sound odd and “out of context.”
In a given context, even a function word’s information might become
important, and then the function word would have a greater degree of stress.
For example, consider the context below:
A. Did Mary shoot her husband?
B. No, she shot YOUR husband!
In this context, the information carried by “your” is unpredictable, new,
and salient. Thus, it gets stressed (in fact, it gets extra stress because it is
contrastive—yours not hers—and surprising). In fact, in (B) given its
context (A), it will be the focus of the intonation unit. When speakers want
to contrast or emphasize something, they can use extra stress (marked by
more dramatic pitch changes and/or loudness)—this is called “emphatic
stress.”
The intonation contour of an utterance is an important part of its meaning.
The intonation contour gives listeners clues about how to interpret what the
speaker has said, as well as clues about the speaker’s attitude and emotions.
There is much more detailed information about intonation available in
linguistics than we can cover in this book. However, we can state an Intonation
Tool:
Tool #5: The Intonation Tool
For any communication, ask how a speaker’s intonation contour contributes to
the meaning of an utterance. What idea units did the speaker use? What
information did the speaker make salient (in terms of where the intonational
focus is placed)? What information did the speaker background as given or old
by making it less salient? What sorts of attitudinal and/or affective (emotional)
meaning does the intonation contour convey? In dealing with written texts,
always read them out loud and ask what sort of intonation contour readers must
add to the sentences to make them make full sense.
In this book, we will not transcribe most properties of the intonational
contours of utterances. We do often transcribe whether an idea unit (tone
unit) ends on a final or non-final pitch glide (remember idea units end on the 
Language and Context 35
pitch glide that constitutes the focus of the idea unit). When an idea unit ends
on a falling pitch glide (or a rise–fall with a good deal of fall), it sounds “final.”
Information is closed off and what comes next is treated as a separate piece of
information. This is also true when an idea unit ends in a rise, which often
signals a question (“Did she leave?”). Final contours, contours that end on
final pitch glides, are like a speech equivalent of a period or question mark (or,
in some cases, an exclamation mark).
When an idea unit ends in a rise, fall, rise–fall, or fall–rise of pitch, but the
rise or fall is small, it sounds non-final, as if the next idea unit following is part
of the information being conveyed. Non-final contours, contours that end on
a non-final pitch glide, are like the speech equivalent of commas.
Problem 5
Consider the data from the child at the start of this section, reprinted below.
If you had said this where would you have placed a final contour (symbolized
by “//”) and where a non-final one (“/”)? Why?
1. there was a hook
2. on the top of the stairway
3. an’ my father was pickin me up
4. an’ I got stuck on the hook
5. up there
6. an’ I hadn’t had breakfast
7. he wouldn’t take me down
8. until I finished all my breakfast
9. cause I didn’t like oatmeal either
The girl placed a non-final contour on each idea unit except the last one
(“cause I didn’t like oatmeal either”). This girl and some (but not all) other
African-American children in the classroom, when they were telling stories,
placed a final contour at the ends of “episodes.” Other children in the
classroom placed them at the ends of what would have been, loosely speaking,
sentences in writing (so they might well have placed a final contour at the end
of lines 2, 5, 6, and 9 (and perhaps, too, at line 3).
Consider again the data on sharing time in Section 1.5, do you think this fact
about the placement of final intonation contours had anything to do with why
the teacher’s interruptions disrupted some of the African-American children?
The teacher thought some of the African-American children “rambled on.”
Do the different uses of final intonation contours illuminate why the teacher
might have made this judgment, keeping in mind that no speakers are
consciously aware of the intonation contours people are using? Listeners from
different cultures just expect to hear things like final contours at certain places
and get disturbed if they do not, though they do not know why they are 
 36 Language and Context
disturbed. They have to seek some reason, however spurious it might be. This
sort of thing happens often when something in someone’s language bothers
us, but we do not know what its linguistic basis is or that it even has one.
Written language leaves out intonation—that is, the stress, pitch or tone,
loudness, and pacing of the voice. When we read, we can add back these
speech elements by “speaking” silently in our own minds (in the Middle Ages
people actually mumbled out loud as they read). This way we make guess
about and add information about information saliency, emphasis, attitude,
and emotion to the text, and, in that sense, “rewrite” it.

tested against the two criteria for valid constitutions proposed in the previous
chapter. As to the first criterion, there was a genuine balance of power in
English society, expressing itself in the Whig and Tory parties. As narrowly
confined to the privileged classes as these were, they nonetheless represented
different factions and tendencies. Elections meant real choice among
separate, contending parties and personalities.

1.6 The Frame Problem
Falsification
The questions in Sections 1.4 and 1.5 do not have definitive answers. Discourse
analysis is an empirical enterprise. Any initial answer to a question is really
just a hypothesis. A hypothesis is an educated guess based on some evidence.
After we form a hypothesis, then we seek yet more evidence. At some point,
we feel the amount of evidence we have makes us confident enough to claim
that our hypothesis is true. Yet even then additional evidence—found by
ourselves or other investigators—could eventually show that we are wrong or,
at least, that additions or changes must be made to our claim.
Empirical inquiry—that is, any investigations whose claims are based on
evidence—is about falsification. We seek to make a claim and then see if we
or others can falsify it. If it is falsified, we learn something. The field, as a
whole, moves forward. In that sense, empirical inquiry is a social endeavor.
We look to our colleagues to help us by trying to falsify our claims.
Because fields move forward through falsifying claims, there is no need to
be timid about hypotheses. If one seeks to make the safest and most narrow
hypothesis, then that hypothesis is harder to falsify. Even if it turns out to be
true, we have not learned as much as we could. If we make a bolder and
broader hypothesis, it is easier to falsify and we can learn more.
To see how this works, consider an example: Let’s say you, in the United
States, had seen lots of White swans and no black ones. You could make the
narrow hypothesis: “All swans in the U.S. are White” (or even worse, “All the
swans I have seen are White”). Or you could make the broader hypothesis:
“All swans are White.”
This latter hypothesis will turn out to be false and will be shown to be so
when someone shows us that there are black swans in Australia (as there are).
Now we can retrench to a narrower hypothesis like “All swans outside
Australia are White” and see if this can be falsified. Having made the bolder
hypothesis we have forced ourselves to learn more about swans by pushing
ourselves and others to search more widely for evidence (in this case, to go
out and look for black swans well beyond the United States).
Not all people agree with this view of science. Some people think you
should only make the safest and most narrow hypotheses. But if you look at
the more mature sciences and the best scientists this is not how, in my opinion,
they behave. Being wrong in science is not a bad thing; it is a good thing, so 
 38 Language and Context
long as the claims you make are clear and interesting enough to be tested and
lead to further inquiry and further evidence gathering.
The Frame Problem
Discourse analysis has a special and interesting problem when it comes to
gathering evidence and falsifying claims. What something means in language—
and, thus, the answers to the questions in Sections 1.4 and 1.5—is partly a
matter of context, as we have already seen. The same words can have different
meanings in different contexts. For example, consider that the word “coffee”
means something different in “The coffee spilled, clean it up” when I hand
you a mop than when I hand you a broom. “You are one of a kind” can be, in
one context, a sarcastic insult (when it means something like you are a one of
a kind idiot) and, in another context, a compliment (when it means something
like you are a one of a kind friend).
One way we give evidence for claims in discourse analysis is by showing
that, given the context in which something was uttered, it must or probably
means what we say it does. For example, given that the coffee that spilled was
liquid and a mop was involved, “coffee” in “The coffee spilled, clean it up”
almost certainly means “coffee as liquid” and not “coffee as beans or grains”
(“The coffee spilled, go get a broom”) or “coffee as coffee tins” (“The coffee
spilled, restack it”).
However, context is, in a sense, infinite. We can always learn more about
the context in which an utterance was made (the physical, social, cultural, and
institutional environment, the previous utterances and interaction of the
people involved, their shared knowledge, including shared cultural
knowledge). How much of the context should we take into account? Isn’t it
always possible that if we consider more of the context, we will find out that
claims about meaning we thought were true are, in reality, false?
An example: We are sure Joe and Jack are friends—because look at how
they smile at each other—and so when Joe says “Jack, you are one of a kind,”
we are sure he means it as a compliment. But then we research their histories
and find out that they have been pretending to be friends all along for business
reasons when years ago they had a serious falling out and they actually hate
each other. Perhaps, now we think, Joe meant “You are one of a kind” as an
insult and Jack knew it, but they both pretended otherwise. More research has
shown us the context was not what we thought it was when we just looked at
the smiles on their faces.
We can always learn more—or at least this is so in a great many cases—that
makes us questions judgments we have made about what people mean. Even
if we know a lot about the context, we can still find out more that may make
us question judgments we have made about meaning.
This problem has been called “the Frame Problem.” The Frame Problem,
more formally put, is this: Any aspect of context can affect the meaning of an 
Language and Context 39
utterance. Context, however, is indefinitely large, ranging from local matters
like the positioning of bodies and eye gaze, through people’s beliefs and
previous interactions, to historical, institutional, and cultural settings. No
matter how much of the context we have considered in offering an
interpretation of an utterance, there is always the possibility of considering
other and additional aspects of the context, and these new considerations may
change how we interpret the utterance.
Where do we cut off consideration of context? How can we be sure any
interpretation is “right,” if considering further aspects of the context might
well change that interpretation?
The Frame Problem is not just the problem that what we think we know
about the context may turn out to be false (as it was in the Joe and Jack case).
What we know about the context can be true, but too limited. For example, in
the data in Section 1.4, it is easy to conclude that Karen is just perturbed by
the fact that Sara did not attend the summer institute when she said she was
going to. And this is true, as far as it goes. But when we learn more about the
context, as we will in a moment, it is easy to conclude that Karen is perturbed
about bigger issues, as well, and is using the Sara’s failure to come to the
institute as but one example of a larger problem.
Let me make it clear that the Frame Problem is a problem both for everyday
people and for us discourse analysts. We both face the same problems: How
do we know we won’t learn more that makes us doubt what we thought people
meant? How do know where to stop considering more aspects of context so
we can get on with communicating or analyzing?
Everyday people solve the Frame Problem by making judgments about how
much and what aspects of the context are “relevant” to what a person has just
said; that is, they bring to communication standards of relevance. At the same
time, when things seem to be going awry, when communication is becoming
confusing or unclear, they consider more of the context and change their
judgment about what was and was not relevant.
We will do the same, except we will be yet more vigilant about context than
are everyday people (who, after all, must get on with the business of living and
acting). We will always be willing to push context a bit further than we would
in everyday life to see if we can falsify our claims about meaning.
The Frame Problem in Action
To see the Frame Problem in action consider the data we saw in Section 1.4,
which I reprint below:
LAST YEAR /
Mary Washington /
who is our curriculum coordinator here /
had a call from Sara // 
 40 Language and Context
at Woodson //
And called me /
and said (pause) /
“We have a person from Woodson /
who’s in the History Department /
she’s interested in doing some RESEARCH /
into BLACK / history //
And she would like to get involved with the school /
And here’s her number /
Give her a call” //
And we- I DID call her /
And we um both expected /
to be around /
for the summer institute //
at Woodson //
I did /
ah participate in it /
But SARA /
wasn’t able to do that //
(Sara tries unsuccessfully to interrupt)
In Section 1.4, I asked the following question: What did Sara do that angered
or perturbed Karen? Just looking at the transcript and the little bit of context
I gave you, one might very well conclude that what perturbed Karen was that
Sara had failed to show up for the summer institute. But, as the transcript
shows, Sara wanted to interrupt Karen at this point, though she could not do
so, as Karen plowed on past her attempt. We know from other data that Sara
wanted to explain that she had a good reason to miss the institute and that
Karen knew the reason. Under such circumstances we could have imagined
Karen not being bothered by Sara’s failure to attend, but, nonetheless, she
makes a big deal of it.
We know more about the context from another piece of the data I also gave
you earlier, reprinted below:
Well at that point there were three of us (laughs) //
Back in the summer //
And all three of us had not yet /
Met together //
From this we know that Karen has done things to get ready for the project,
including getting her colleague Jane to be part of it. We can hypothesize here
that Karen is bothered by the fact that an official meeting of the project was
called so late, so long after Sara’s call to the school and Karen’s own initial
efforts. Since it was Sara’s project—she had asked for it—it was her
responsibility to move things along, and yet for a long time it was Karen who
was moving things along.
Language and Context 41
So both Sara’s failure to call a meeting and her failure to show up at the
institute look to Karen like a lack of taking responsibility where one has
contracted an obligation to do so. So we can hypothesize now that what
bothers Karen is Sara’s lack of taking responsibility and, in a sense, putting the
burden on Karen.
But now there is another part of the context that many readers of this book will
not be familiar with. In the school in which Karen works—and this is true in
many other schools—there are “official rules” and an “official chain of command”
and there are “unofficial rules” and “unofficial chain of command.” In the official
rules, an administrator like Mary Washington is the one from whom one would
seek permission to involve the school’s children in a research project.
In the unofficial rules the teacher “owns” the children in her class (as a
teacher says in the data—see below) and one must seek her permission first
and informally for the involvement of herself and her children before going to
an administrator. Sara, by calling Mary Washington first, and having Mary
“order” Karen to call Sara, had unknowingly violated the unofficial rules and
unofficial chain of command.
We know from other parts of our data that this issue greatly concerned
Karen and her friend Jane (who she had involved in the project). For example,
in a much later meeting of the same group, Jane had the following to say:
Well I think /
One thing you need to recognize /
About the STRUCTURE of the Middleview schools
Is that if Su, Lucy, Karen, and I /
Or any combination thereof /
Are involving our classrooms /
We are the people who need to be asked /
And to be plugged into it //
Joe does /
Um as curriculum coordinator for Field Street /
Does not have the right to commit Su Wilson //
Nor Linda Defoe //
Nor does Mary /
Have the right to commit /
Or structure the grant for us //
Uh it becomes a question /
Like Karen said /
This isn’t her priority area / [Because Karen teaches English, not History like Jane]
That she wants to be in //
If it is mine /
Or someone else /
We are the direct people //
In a sense we OWN the kids //
If you want the children to be doing the work /
You’ve got to get the classroom teacher /
Not the curriculum coordinator or [the next speaker interrupts Jane]
 42 Language and Context
Jane is here talking in a context where Sara has written a grant proposal to
continue the project in the next year and has, once again, gone to Mary
Washington first and not the teachers. Joe is an administrator (and Su and
Lucy are teachers at his school) who was also at the first meeting. Mary is, of
course, Mary Washington, the same administrator who Sara called and who
told Karen to call her. Jane here explicitly says that when someone wants to
involve a teacher’s classroom that teacher must be asked (and she means asked
first, since she is well aware that administrators must give permission
eventually).
When Jane says “structure” with emphatic stress she could mean a formal
and official structure or an informal and unofficial one. Since Sara and Mary
have, by the time Jane is talking, twice gone ahead and agreed to involve the
teachers’ classrooms without having asked them first, it is clear that the
structure to which Jane is referring is an informal, unofficial, but nonetheless
binding one for Jane and her friend Karen (who in this meeting strongly agrees
with Jane).
So now, with more context—by framing our data in a wider set of contextual
data—we can hypothesize that another thing that perturbed Karen was that
Sara “broke the rules.” She failed to know the rules of the school as a culture
even as she wanted the school’s involvement and support. At a deeper level,
this seems to Karen an example of Sara’s lack of taking responsibility. Thus,
she uses her utterances to cast Sara as untrustworthy person who does not
take proper responsibility.
Karen was not trying to end her involvement with the project. She was not
going to walk out. She was still more than willing to go on with the project
and she did. She had every intention of dealing with Sara. She wanted to be
part of the project and she very much wanted the resources the project would
bring her students, since her school was not a wealthy one by any means.
What Karen was using language to do here was to “correct the hierarchy”
between her and Sara.
By going to the administrator Mary Washington, Sara had set up an “official”
hierarchy in which Karen was just a follower to be ordered around. Karen is
making it clear that she is not there to be ordered around by Sara, but to be a
full and equal participant. She is showing herself to be a do-er and leader and
organizer in her own right, while Sara has slacked off in these respects.
Karen is trying to assert the rights of the “unofficial” hierarchy in which the
teacher is the boss when it comes to her children and classroom. In fact, she
and the other teachers involved in the project will eventually make it clear to
all that they are the “protectors” and “nurturers” of their children and not just
their “teachers” and these are roles no administrator or university professor
can take over from them.
So why doesn’t Karen just directly say Sara broke the rules by going first to
Mary Washington? Well, these are “unofficial rules” and there is an
administrator present in the meeting. The people in the meeting do not all 
Language and Context 43
know each other as well as they will after many more meetings. Further, it
would take a great deal of time to explicate the whole system for people who
don’t know it. So Karen uses other examples of Sara’s lack of understanding
and responsibility, since her main goal appears not to be to explicate how the
“rules” work in schools (not yet), but to correct the hierarchy.
Since we have argued that hierarchy and status are at stake here, we can add
another piece of the context that would seem to support this. As in many
other towns in the United States, in Middleview there is a good deal of tension
both between the town and the university (a town–gown problem). The
university has been in the town for over a hundred years, but it is a private and
elite university and the town is a working class, post-industrial town.
Furthermore, there is a tension between teachers and the university, which
trained some of them (though most were trained either by the Catholic college
in town or the local state university). The teachers see the university professors,
including those in Education (as were the Research Institute people), as
disconnected from the realities of teaching and schools. The professors see the
teachers as “a-theoretical” and anti-research. This division is made worse by
the fact that the vast majority of the teachers in the town were born there and
intend to stay there, while the vast majority of the professors at the university
were not born there and many do not intend to spend their entire careers
there.
All these aspects of context certainly make it likely that issues of hierarchy,
status, and leadership will be foregrounded in the interactions between these
teachers and university academics. Such issues would have to be dealt with if
one wanted to facilitate the workings of this group of teachers and academics.
Indeed, this is one role that discourse analysis can help with. We can study
how things go wrong and try to help people themselves understand and deal
with enough of the context in which they are communicating to make things
go right or, at least, “righter.”
Remember, however, that even though we have now explicated more of the
context, our claims are and will always remain open to falsification. They are,
perhaps, at this point a bit beyond mere hypotheses (guesses). We are getting
a fair amount of evidence. Nonetheless, we ourselves or others must continue
to try to falsify them by learning more about the context. As we learn more
and more and then come to a point where we are no longer led to change or
deepen our claims, we gain more confidence in our claims and they grow in
validity. At that point, we stop and believe our claims, though even then
somebody someday may choose later to re-study our data or similar data and
question our claims or, at least, modify them. That is all to the good. This is
an empirical and social enterprise.
Now, go back to the questions in Section 1.4 and answer them again.
Compare your first answers and the ones you give now. Consider areas
where you would disagree with claims I have made (if you do) and why.
Where do you want more evidence? How would you get it? What other 
 44 Language and Context
questions would you now ask about the data? If you agree with some of my
claims, how would you state them in your own words?
As Karen’s data shows, it is hard at times to know just how much information
and how many assumptions and inferences that we can make or discover are
actually relevant to a communication we are in or are analyzing. How far
should we go? That is the Frame Problem and the Frame Problem makes the
Filling In task hard at times (whether for everyday people or us discourse
analysts).

1.7 The Frame Problem Tool
The Frame Problem tells us that we should, when we think we are done with
an analysis, see if we can look at the context again and widen what we take to
be relevant. If looking at more context does not change what we think the
language means, then we can be satisfied, at least for the time being, that our
analysis is on the right track (though it might always be falsified later). If
considering more context or rethinking what is relevant in the context does
change what we think, then we have to push the analysis further.
The Frame Problem is a way to keep us honest. We cannot always find out
more about the context of data we are analyzing, but we can try. So here is the
Frame Tool:
Tool #6: The Frame Tool
After you have completed your discourse analysis—after you have taken into
consideration all the aspects of the context that you see as relevant to the
meaning of the data—see if you can find out anything additional about the
context in which the data occurred and see if this changes your analysis. If it
doesn’t, your analysis is safe for now. If it does, you have more work to do.
Always push your knowledge of the context as far as you can just to see if
aspects of the context are relevant that you might at first have not thought were
relevant or if you can discover entirely new aspects of the context. 
Language and Context 45
1.8 Working with the Frame Problem Tool
Consider the following discussion drawn from Roger Lewontin’s book Biology
as Ideology. Lewontin (born 1929) is a well-known biologist at Harvard. In his
book he tells us that from the point of view of medical science, it is a truism
that the cause of tuberculosis is the tubercle bacillus. But then he tells us that
tuberculosis was a very common disease in the sweatshops and factories of the
nineteenth century, whereas it was much less common among rural people
and in the upper classes. So, Lewontin asks, why don’t we conclude that the
cause of tuberculosis is unregulated industrial capitalism?
In fact, in light of the history of health and disease in modern Europe,
Lewontin’s explanation makes sense. An examination of the causes of death,
first systematically recorded in the 1830s in Britain and a bit later in North
America, show that most people did, indeed, die of infectious diseases. As the
nineteenth century progressed, however, the death rate from all these diseases
continuously decreased. To quote Lewontin:
Smallpox was dealt with by a medical advance, but one that could hardly be
claimed by modern medicine, since smallpox vaccine was discovered in the
eighteenth century and already was quite widely used by the early part of the
nineteenth. The death rates of the major killers like bronchitis, pneumonia, and
tuberculosis fell regularly during the nineteenth century, with no obvious cause.
There was no observable effect on the death rate after the germ theory of disease
was announced in 1876 by Robert Koch. The death rate from these infectious
diseases simply continued to decline as if Koch had never lived. By the time
chemical therapy was introduced for tuberculosis in the earlier part of this
century, more than 90 percent of the decrease in the death rate from that disease
had already occurred. (Lewontin 1991: pp. 43–4)
It was not modern sanitation or less crowding in cities that led to the progressive
reductions in the death rate, since the major killers in the nineteenth century
were respiratory and not waterborne, and parts of our cities are as crowded
today as they were in the 1850s. More likely, the reduction in death from
infectious diseases is due to general improvement in nutrition related to an
increase in the real wage in “developed countries”: “In countries like Brazil
today, infant mortality rises and falls with decreases and increases in the
minimum wage” (Lewontin 1991: p. 44).
What Lewontin is doing here is widening the contextual frame within
which we look at a perfectly “natural” and “obvious” claim from biology. He
is juxtaposing the way that medicine or biology looks at a claim (the cause of
tuberculosis is the tubercle bacillus) with how other areas, such as public
health or a sociopolitical discussion of capitalism, would look at the claim.
Another example that Lewontin gives is the way in which biologists talk
about genes “self-replicating.” Yet, genes cannot make themselves (any more
than a blueprint can make a house). Genes are made by a complex machinery 
 46 Language and Context
of proteins that uses the genes as models for more genes. It is not the genes
that are self-replicating, it is the entire organism as complex system. Isolating
genes as “master molecules,” and effacing the “manufacturing machinery” of
proteins that actually carry out the work of making other proteins and genes
themselves, is “another unconscious ideological commitment, one that places
brains above brawn, mental work as superior to mere physical work,
information as higher than action” (Lewontin 1991: p. 48).
Lewontin is using what we have called The Frame Problem Tool in a certain
way. He is aware that when biologists say something like “the cause of
tuberculosis is the tubercle bacillus,” they mean “cause” in the narrow sense
of “physical/medical cause,” if they actually consciously think about and
reflect on the matter at all. Thus, they are considering the social and political
parts of the context of their utterance (i.e., the social and political facts
Lewontin points to as true about who dies from tuberculosis and who does
not) as irrelevant to their meaning and, thus, too, not part of what listeners are
meant to fill in.
Lewontin broadens the frame within which we look at the statement—
increases the amount of context he takes as relevant—to change how we think
about the original statement. We now, perhaps, see the statement as less than
the whole story, not completely true, as ignoring or effacing important issues.
This sort of broadening of the contextual frame is one way to engage in a
politically committed discourse analysis and to engage in what we can call
“resistant” listening and reading (i.e., resisting the limits the speaker or writer
wants listeners or readers to put on what is relevant information in the
context).
Problem 7
Here are some questions for you to think about in terms of using the Frame
Problem Tool:
1. Do you “buy” Lewontin’s analysis? Do you think it is “fair”?
2. What do you think the purpose is (or purposes are) of Lewontin’s
analysis? Do you think that his way of broadening the contextual frame is
a good way to achieve these purposes?
3. Lewontin clearly has deep political commitments (he has sometimes
identified himself as a Marxist or at least as left-leaning). Do you think
this invalidates his analysis? Does it make his analyses “unscientific”?
“Unempirical”?
4. Malaria, an infectious disease, is one of the most severe public health
problems worldwide. It is a leading cause of death and disease in many
developing countries, where young children and pregnant women are the
groups most affected. Worldwide, one death in three is from an infectious
or communicable disease. However, almost all these deaths occur in the 
Language and Context 47
non-industrialized world. Health inequality effects not just how people
live, but often dictates how and at what age they die (see: www.cdc.gov/
malaria/impact/index.htm and http://ucatlas.ucsc.edu/cause.php). Given
this information, do you find the following dialogue odd? If you do, why?
If you don’t, why not?
Question: Why do so many children in Africa die before they are five
years old?
Answer: Because they get infectious diseases like malaria and others.

2.1 The Doing and Not Just Saying Tool
People Do Things with Language, Not Just Say Things
What is the purpose of human language? Many people, especially in
modern societies, think the major purpose of language is to convey
information. However, we do a lot more with language than give each other
information.
In fact, language may not be an ideal form for giving information. Many
academic disciplines, which are in the business of discovering and
communicating new information, have found the need to develop more
explicit and clearer forms of communication through mathematics and other
sorts of symbol systems (as, for example, in physics).
Even when they use language, academic disciplines tend to use varieties of
language that are more arcane and complex than everyday language. For
example, a biologist might say something like “Hornworm growth displays a
significant amount of variation” for what we might say in everyday life as
“Hornworms sure vary a lot in how well they grow.”
In our everyday lives, even when we are conveying information to someone,
we are also trying to do other things, as well. In fact, for all their emphasis on
information, we will eventually see that this is true of academic disciplines
and their forms of language as well. Not only do we use language to do many
different things, but any one utterance is often meant simultaneously to carry
out more than one action.
Because language is used for different functions and not just to convey
information (which is but one of its functions), it is always useful to ask of any
communication: What is the speaker trying to DO and not just what is the
speaker trying to SAY? We humans use language to carry out various sorts of
actions and informing someone else is only one sort of action that we
accomplish through language.
For example, consider the little the utterances below:
1. It’s a cold one today. [From one neighbor to another as they pass by
each other.]
2. Teacher: What is 5 + 2? Student: 7.
3. I pronounce you man and wife. [Said by minister.]
4. I promise to be there by five.
5. Can you lift a hundred pounds?
6. Can you pass me the salt?
7. Pass me the salt?
What are the purposes (functions) of these utterances? The neighbor who
says “It’s a cold one today” surely knows the neighbor to whom he said it
already knows it is cold. So why say it? What is the speaker trying to do?
Saying, Doing, and Designing 51
Normally when we ask questions, we do not know the answer. But the
teacher in (2) does know the answer to the question she is asking and school
is one place (one context) where we accept and expect questions that are not
really asking for information the asker does not already know. Why? The
purpose of the teacher’s question is not to find out the answer to the question.
What is its purpose?
Saying “I pronounce you man and wife” only works to carry out the action
of marrying two people if the person saying it is a minister or other sort of
appropriate official. If I say it to two friends, it doesn’t work. Institutional
arrangements (ministers and marriage ceremonies) are required here for the
language to work. But if I say “I promise to be there at five” I have engaged in
the action of promising and no institutional arrangements are required. Why
can I promise with no need of institutional support, but not pronounce two
people man and wife without such support?
When I ask if you can lift a hundred pounds, I am asking if you have the
ability to do it. The action in which I am engaged is asking a question. But
when I ask if you can pass me the salt at dinner, I am not asking if you have
the ability, but asking you to pass me the salt. The action in which I am
engaged is a request. In the first case you can say “yes,” but in the second you
cannot just say “yes” and leave it at that. You actually have to pass me the salt.
How can “can” mean such different things in these two utterances? How do
we know it means these different things? Can we imagine settings in which
“Can you lift a hundred pounds?” (or, say, “Can you lift a hundred pounds for
me?”) means “Will you lift a hundred pounds for me?” and “Can you pass me
the salt?” means “Do you have the ability to pass me the salt”?
“Pass me the salt” is not a request, but an order. Why is it usually ruder to
say this than “Can you pass me the salt?”? Even if I say, “Pass me the salt,
please?” this sounds ruder or blunter than “Can you pass me the salt?,” at
least to me. Why? “Please, pass me the salt” sounds less rude or blunt than
“Pass me the salt, please.” Why?
There are some verbs in English—like “pronounce” (in “pronounce you
man and wife”), “promise,” “ask,” “tell,” “request,” and “forgive”—that name
actions directly. These are called “direct speech acts.” There are also indirect
ways to perform speech acts. If I say “I promise you I will come at five,” the
word “promise” directly names the action of promising. But I can also promise
less directly by saying something like “I will be there at five” or even “I WILL
be there at five,” though, of course, a statement like “I will be there at five” has
other uses, as well. It could be a simple statement of fact (an act of informing)
or a prediction (as in “I will win the match next Friday”).
Asking “Will you pass me the salt?” is a direct question; it is one of the
structures we use in English to signal that we are asking a question. “Can
you pass me the salt?” sounds like a question (about your ability)—and this
structure can be used as a direct question (as in “Can you lift a hundred
pounds)—but it can, as we have seen, be an indirect and polite way to 
 52 Saying, Doing, and Designing
perform a request. A direct way to make a request would be: “I request you
to pass me the salt,” a form we would rarely actually use (sounds too formal,
though we would say something like: “I request your presence at the
inquest”).
We are concerned here with actions in a much broader sense than just
direct speech acts (like “I promise to come”) and indirect speech acts (like
“I will come” when it is used not just to inform, but to make a promise).
These are all verbal actions (“speech acts”), acts tied closely to speaking and
language. But here we are concerned also with actions that given uses of
language carry out, but which themselves have nothing particularly to do
with speaking (in the way in which promising and requesting do, since these
are actions that can only be carried out in language), actions like insulting
you (something I can also do without language, e.g., by a gesture) or making
you feel important (also something I can do without language, e.g., by
saluting you).
Anything we say performs some sort of action. Even if you ask me the time
and I say “It’s five o’clock,” I am engaged in the actions both of answering you
and informing you. If you and I are fellow lawyers and you say to me, after a
tennis match, “You are not so great at tennis” and I say “But I am a better
lawyer than you are,” my remark can be, depending on how we read the
context (see the Fill In Tool and The Frame Problem Tool), performing
different actions (some of them even all together): informing you I think I am
a better lawyer than you; bragging; getting back at you for insulting my tennis;
correcting my feelings of being inferior to you at sports; needling you; joking
with you; acting out further our competitive relationship; threatening your
face (that is, your identity as a good lawyer), and others. Here we are concerned
with actions as broad as these. They are not inherently verbal. While it is often
easier to carry them out in language, they can be carried out in other ways, as
well, unlike promising and requesting.
The relationship between language and action is a very complex one and we
will have a good deal more to say about later in this book. For now, what is
important is that you learn to ask of any communication not just “What is the
speaker trying to say?” but also “What is the speaker trying to do?.”
In this section we have developed the basis for a new tool, although we
develop this basis further later in the book. Our new tool is “The Doing and
Not Just Saying Tool?”:
Tool #7: The Doing and Not Just Saying Tool
For any communication, ask not just what the speaker is saying, but what he or
she is trying to do, keeping in mind that he or she may be trying to do more than
one thing.

2.2 Working with the Doing and Not Just Saying Tool
Below I reprint some data that will allow us to work with the Doing and Not
Just Saying Tool. However, this data is also a good opportunity to work
more with the Making Strange Tool. The data is the beginning of a
conversation at home between a mother and her three-year-old. In some
families parents do not talk and interact with their three-year-olds this way.
In some other families such talk and interaction is common. The Frame
Problem Tool can be used here, too, as you think about how much of the
context is relevant to what this mother is doing and push the relevant
context beyond the home.
In this interaction, the mother and child have in front of them a plastic
dinosaur, a plastic replica of a dinosaur’s egg, and a little card on which is
written the name of the dinosaur and information about it and its egg. As you
think about this data, ask what the mother is trying to do and not just say.
Ask, too, where the mother is trying to give the child information and why.
Even when she is giving the child information, is this the only thing she is
trying to do, her only purpose?
Problem 8
This data is from Crowley and Jacobs’ paper “Islands of expertise and the
development of family scientific literacy.” I have reprinted the transcript as
they have printed it. The bold print on “egg” means emphatic stress and “...”
means a noticeable pause. “C” is the child and “M” is the mother:
C: This looks like this is an egg.
M: Ok well this…
 That’s exactly what it is!
 How did you know?
C: Because it looks like it.
M: That’s what it says,
 see look egg, egg…
…Replica of a dinosaur egg.
 From the oviraptor.
 54 Saying, Doing, and Designing
Here are questions to think about in trying to apply the Doing and Not Just
Saying Tool to this data:
1. When the child says “This looks like this is an egg” the mother says
“That’s exactly what it is!” in an energized way. The exclamation point
means her intonation contour was one of excitement or surprise (as does
her use of “exactly” here). Why does the mother say this in such an
energized, excited way? Is she actually excited or surprised? Is her
excitement or surprise real or “faked”? If you think it is faked,” why is it?
What is the mother trying to do?
2. Why does the mother ask the child “How did you know?” after he has
says: “This looks like this is an egg.” The child in saying “this looks like”
seems actually to making a guess, rather than claiming to know. Why
does the mother take him to making a claim to know, rather than just a
guess?
3. The child answers the mother’s question about how he knew it was an egg
by saying “Because it looks like it.” Then the mother says “That’s what it
says [here on the card].” Why does she say this? The child has answered
“how do you know” by making an observation based on how things look
to him. The mother is pointing to print as an answer to the question.
Why?
4. After the mother says “That’s what it says” [here on this card], she says
“see look egg, egg… Replica of a dinosaur egg.” From the oviraptor.” The
mother is telling the child to look at the printed card. He is three years old
and cannot read, so why is she telling him to look at the card? Why is she
emphasizing the word “egg” (which is printed on the card)?
5. The mother reads off the card “Replica of a dinosaur egg. From the
oviraptor.” This is hardly three-year-old language (“replica,” “oviraptor”).
Why does she read it to the child? The mother doesn’t just read this sort
of language to her child, she speaks it as well. Later she says:
Do you have a . . . You have an oviraptor on your game! You know the egg game
on your computer? That’s what it is, an oviraptor. And that’s from the Cretaceous
period. And that was a really, really long time ago.
Why does she speak this way (“oviraptor,” “Cretaceous period”) to the
child? Why is she bringing up the child’s game?
6. Do you think this three-year-old knows a lot about dinosaurs? Do you
think he is a “little expert” on dinosaurs? Can three-years-olds know a lot
about something like dinosaurs by adult standards? Does what the child
know about dinosaurs have anything to do with what the mother is trying
to do in the way she talks to and interacts with the child here?
7. When people communicate, they are trying to do things with each
utterance and with a whole set of utterances taken together. They have 
Saying, Doing, and Designing 55
local goals or purposes for each utterance and larger, more global goals
for a whole set of connected utterances. What is the mother trying to do
or accomplish with the whole set of utterances we have transcribed
above? Does school (though the child is not in school yet) have anything
to do with what she is trying to do?
It may be useful for readers at this point to reconsider earlier data in this book
in terms of the Doing and Not Just Saying tool.

2.3 Using Grammar to Build Structures and Meanings
The Container/Conduit View of Language
We said in the last section that language is about doing and not just saying.
The traditional view of language pays attention only to saying and not doing.
It sees meaning as something that resides in the head of the speaker as
“concepts” or “ideas.” When speaking, the speaker encodes these concepts
into words and phrases as if they were containers and then conveys them to
the listener. The listener decodes the language received and removes the
concepts from their containers. Then the listener stores these concepts in his
or her head. This is a “conveyor belt” and “container” view of language in
which speaking is like putting things (concepts) into containers (made of
language) and conveying them to listeners who take them out of the containers
and put them in their heads.
We already know this view is seriously wrong. For one thing it has nothing
to say about the role of context and the listener’s need to use context to engage
in “filling in” what the speaker has left unsaid. For another thing, it leaves out
all we do with language beyond conveying information and ideas to each
other. We have seen that in speaking, people are actively doing things, not just
conveying messages.
The “conveyor belt” and “container” view of language is, of course, based
on a metaphor, a metaphor that treats speaking and writing as like putting
things in a container and conveying them to others. Metaphors are important
for understanding complex things. They can illuminate things, allowing us to
see them in new and useful ways. Or they can blind us to things they leave out
of the picture (things like context and doing and not just saying). The conveyor
belt and container metaphor is a poor one, however common a way it is to
think about language and communication.
 56 Saying, Doing, and Designing
Grammar as Tools for Building Structures and Meanings
A better view of language than the “conveyor belt” and “container” view of
language is what I will call a “building and designing view.” I have already said
that when we speak, we are always doing things and not just saying things or
communicating information. In order to do things with language (including
informing), we use grammar to build and design structures and meanings.
Imagine you were making a car. You have to build (put parts together) and
design (choose what parts to put together). There are lots of choices to make.
Making a car means choosing what sort of car (e.g., compact, SUV, convertible,
station wagon) to build in the first place. It means, as well, choosing for each
part what type of part to use and what specific part to use. For example, while
building any car requires that you have an engine, you must choose what type
of engine (e.g., gas, diesel, rotary, four cylinder, V6, V8) to have and what
specific engine (of that type) actually to put in.
Some parts are optional, so you must choose whether to include these or
not. For example, do you want a hood ornament or not? Hood ornaments are
optional on cars. Finally, you must choose what different parts should go
together. For example, you may not want monster tires on a car that looks like
a Honda Civic. Monster tires and the other parts in a Honda Civic just don’t
go well together. Monster tires are better on trucks.
Cooking from recipes works the same way. We make food by combining
ingredients; we choose which ingredients to buy (e.g., organic tomatoes or
genetically modified), and there are ingredients that are optional.
Of course, most of us don’t build our own cars (and, indeed, many Americans
do not cook their own food). We buy a car from a car lot or buy precooked
and processed food at a market or fast food restaurant. But when we use
language we are all expert builders and designers. Of course, there are
situations where we also take language “off the lot,” so to speak, when we just
repeat what someone else has said or written. But, in most situations, we do
not just repeat what others have said, but build and design our own structures
and meanings.
We can think of language in a similar way to how we thought of building
and designing a car or cooking a meal. In language, too, we have parts of
different types. We must choose what types of phrases we want in our
utterances and how we want to put them together. We must choose what
words we want to use in these phrases. And, here, too, some choices of phrases
and words are optional and some are required (e.g., an English sentence must
have a subject and a transitive verb must have a direct object).
Just as there are rules or procedures to follow in building a car that will
work, the rules of English grammar tell us how we can build things out of
words and phrases. For example, English grammar tells us that connecting an
Article (e.g., “the” or “a(n)”) with an adjective (e.g., “happy” or “tall”) and
then with a noun (e.g., “girl” or “boy”) gets us an acceptable bigger structure, 
Saying, Doing, and Designing 57
called a “noun phrase”: “Art. + Adj. + Noun” (e.g., “the happy girl”). Thus, we
can view grammar, in part, as rules telling us how to use smaller parts to build
bigger things, in this case one type of a noun phrase.
Grammar also tells us how to build prepositional phrases. One way is to
connect a preposition (e.g., “from”) and a noun (e.g., “home”). This will get
us the structure “Prep. + Noun” (e.g., “from home,” “to home,” and “from
Newark”), which is one type of prepositional phrase. Grammar also tells us
that anywhere a noun can occur a noun phrase can occur. So this rule tells us
that if we can have “Prep. + N” (“from home”) as a prepositional phrase, then
we can also have “Prep. + noun phrase” (e.g., “to the happy girl”) as a
prepositional phrase.
Another rule of grammar tells us that a prepositional phrase can be added
to the end of a noun phrase. So to the end of a noun phrase like “Art + Adj. +
Noun” (e.g., “the happy girl”), we can add a prepositional phrase and get: “Art
+ Adj. + Noun + Prep. Ph.” (e.g., “the happy girl from home” or “the happy
girl from the sad town”), a yet bigger noun phrase.
Just as there are rules in grammar for how to build noun phrases and
prepositional phrases, there are rules for how to build verb phrases. So one
sort of verb phrase is composed of a verb followed by a noun or noun phrase,
thus: “Verb + Noun” (e.g., “go home”) or “Verb + Noun Phrase” (e.g., “love
the puppy”). Another type of verb phrase is composed of a verb followed by a
noun or a noun phrase that is in turn followed by a prepositional phrase, thus:
“Verb + Noun + Prep. Ph.” (e.g., “go home to the country”) or “Verb + Noun
Phrase + Prep. Ph.” (e.g., “love the girl with brown hair”).
There are other grammatical categories, other sorts of blocks or bricks with
which we can build beyond the parts of speech. For example, there are the
categories “subject,” “predicate,” and “direct object.” English grammar says
that you can build a sentence if you connect a subject and predicate. A subject
must be a noun or noun phrase and a predicate can be a verb or verb phrase
(there are other types of predicates). In turn, a verb phrase, as we saw above,
is made up of a verb followed by a noun or noun phrase and possibly, too, a
prepositional phrase.
So we can build sentences like: “Noun + Verb” (e.g., “Girls laugh”); “Noun
Phrase + Verb” (e.g., “The happy girl laughed”); “Noun + Verb + Noun” (e.g.,
“Boys like girls”); “Noun Phrase + Verb + Noun” (e.g., “The happy girl likes
boys”); “Noun + Verb + Noun Phrase” (e.g., “Girls like the tall boy”); and “Noun
Phrase + Verb + Noun Phrase” (e.g., “The happy girl likes the tall boy”).
There are yet other grammatical categories; for example, clauses, that serve
as other sorts of bricks (themselves made up of smaller bricks). A clause is any
string of words that has a subject and a predicate, but does not stand as a
complete sentence by itself. Clauses too can be connected to build larger
things. For example, two clauses can be combined with a conjunction (e.g.,
“and,” “but”) to get us a structure or pattern like: “Clause + Conjunction +
Clause” (e.g., “The happy girl laughed and the tall boy left”). Or we can 
 58 Saying, Doing, and Designing
combine a clause with a subordinating conjunction (e.g., “while,” “because”)
and then combine this with another clause in any order to get a structure or
pattern like: “(Subordinating Conjunction + Clause) + Clause” (e.g., “While
the happy girl laughed, the tall boy left”) or “Clause + (Subordinating
Conjunction + Clause)” (e.g., “The tall boy left, while the happy girl laughed”).
So we can see grammatical categories (like nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs,
articles, and prepositions), or subjects, predicates, and direct objects, or
conjunctions and clauses as blocks or bricks or parts with which we can build
larger structures or patterns. But just as with building cars, we also have to
make lots of design decisions as we build.
The design choices we make are these: We choose what to build in the first
place (i.e., what sorts of phrases and sentences we want to build). For example,
I can combine much the same concepts or ideas in a noun phrase (e.g.,
“children’s growth”) or a sentence (“Children grow”). I choose to build a
noun phrase or a sentence based on what I want to mean and do.
We choose what types of words and specific words we want to put in the
phrases and sentences we build. For example, we choose what type of noun
we want to put in a noun phrase we build (e.g., a proper noun like “California”
or a common noun like “state”) and what specific noun we want to use (e.g.,
“state” rather than “province”).
We choose what optional elements to put in or leave out. For example, not
all noun phrases must have an adjective, so both “the happy girl” and “the
girl” are acceptable noun phrases.
We choose what sorts of words should or should not be put together in
order to achieve our own style and purposes. For example, the sentence
“Please find enclosed our contractual agreement” (from a business letter) puts
together a number of formal words (“please,” “enclosed,” “contractual,” and
“agreement”) and thereby creates a formal tone. A sentence like “Give our
contract a look over when you get a chance” combines words in a way that
sounds much less formal and, perhaps, seems a bit odd when talking about
something as official as a contract.
Each way of combining words has a meaning. For example, “John married
Sue” makes John the topic, center of attention, and sees the marriage from his
perspective. “Sue married John” does the same for Sue. “John broke the clock”
focuses on John and his agency more than “The clock was broken by John.”
“Load the wagon with hay” means the wagon is full, while “load hay on the
wagon” does not require the wagon to be full with hay.
Each design choice you make about building language structures determines
certain aspects of what you mean (we have already seen that some meaning is
determined not by what you say, but by the context in which you say it). Each
different choice has a different meaning. You might choose to call someone “a
brave freedom fighter” and I might call the same person a “a cowardly
terrorist.” These are both noun phrases, but what words we choose to put in 
Saying, Doing, and Designing 59
the noun phrases clearly make a difference, even if we are talking about one
and the same person.
Compare saying “I don’t eat beef” (where “beef” is a mass noun) with saying
“I don’t eat cows” (where “cow” is a count noun). Here it is not only the
choice of nouns, but also the type of noun (mass versus count) that makes a
difference. “Beef” treats cows as “stuff,” in particular as food. Saying “I don’t
eat cows” makes them living animals again and makes us aware we are eating
what was once alive.
As an example of different types of verbs (in this case involving the same
word) making a difference, compare “Your clock broke” (where “break” is
being used an intransitive stative verb, that is, a verb with no direct object and
that names a state) with “I broke your clock” (where “break” is now being
used as an transitive, active verb, a verb with a direct object and that names an
action). To use these different type of verbs I also have to choose different
structures (“Your clock broke” versus “I broke your clock”). Even if I broke
the clock, if I tell you “Your clock broke,” I imply it may just have happened.
This is why government bureaucrats so often say things like “Mistakes were
made” rather than “I made some mistakes.”
If you say “The queen died and then the king disappeared” you imply that
the king disappeared because the queen died. If you say “The king
disappeared and then the queen died” you imply that the queen died because
the king disappeared. English grammar allows you to build “Clause +
Conjunction + Clause” structures or patterns, but it matters what order you
put the clauses in.
I can choose to say “The child grew” using a sentence with a verb (“grow”)
or I can choose to say “the child’s growth” using a noun phrase with a noun
(“growth”). The first choice, the sentence version, treats growing as a process
and the second choice, the noun phrase, treats it as an abstract thing. The
second choice also allows me to use the noun phrase to build a bigger, more
complex sentence, for example: “The child’s growth is within normal
variation.”
When we build with language, we follow the rules of grammar, putting the
bricks together in a grammatically acceptable way (according to the rules of
your dialect). We also make design choices about what to build (what types of
phrases and sentences to use); what words and types of words to use; what
options to take when grammar allows options; and what words should or
should not go together in order to achieve our own style and desired meanings,
nuances, and purposes. Every different design choice has a different meaning,
though sometimes meaning differences can be nuanced and subtle.
We want to view words and grammatical rules as tools for active building
and designing. Using language is all about making choices about what and
how to build (design choices) so that we can mean what we want to mean.
But, as we know, this active process also always involves choices about what
not to say and to leave to the listener to fill in based on context.
 60 Saying, Doing, and Designing
We want to view speakers and writers as designers. They design meanings
by designing and building language structures. It is much like cooking where
we create nutrition by combining food ingredients. When we just parrot what
others have said we get the language equivalent of processed food, food made
by someone else (often an institution), someone else who may or may not
have our interest at heart.

Grammar Interlude #4: Vocabulary
English is a Germanic language, that is, it is in the same family as German.
Germanic languages are a family of languages that includes, besides English
and German, Dutch, Yiddish, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic, and Norwegian.
Thus, a good number of English words are, of course, “Germanic.” But English
also contains a large number of words that were borrowed from Latin or from
French (a Romance language derived from Latin). So English has two large
stocks of vocabulary, one Germanic and one Latinate. Of course, English has
also historically borrowed from other languages (e.g., Greek) as well. But
Germanic and Latinate words make up the great majority of the English
vocabulary. [Linguists tend to use the word “lexicon” instead of “vocabulary”
and often call words “lexical items”.]
English contains a great number of Latinate words (words borrowed from
Latin and French) because of two historical events: the conversation of
England in 597 AD to Roman Christianity and the Norman Invasion of
England in 1066 AD. Latin was the language of the Roman Church and the
Normans spoke an early version of French, a daughter language of Latin.
Today, for the most part, Germanic words and Latinate words compose two
different types of vocabulary in English. Germanic words are used more often in
more informal and everyday contexts and Latinate words are used more often in
more formal and specialist contexts (though some of both can be found in each
sort of context). The Latinate vocabulary is the vocabulary of books and people
whose talk is influenced by books. Thus, “see” and “think” are Germanic, while
“perceive” and “conceive” are Latinate. Other examples are, with Germanic first
and Latinate second: “alive”/“animate”; “dog”/“canine”; “cat”/“feline”/
“god”/“deity”; “tell”/“narrate”; “land”/“terrain”; “manly”/“virile.”
Some educators make a distinction in English vocabulary among three
“tiers” of words. Tier 1 words are basic everyday words that occur often in 
Saying, Doing, and Designing 61
spoken language, words like “go,” “home,” “dinner,” and “dog.” Tier 2 words
are more formal words that occur across many academic, specialist, and
public-sphere domains and in a wide variety of written texts, words like
“process,” “state,” “account,” “probable,” “occurrence,” “maintain,”
“benevolent,” and so forth. Such words do not occur regularly in everybody’s
everyday conversation. Tier 3 words are specialist technical terms used in
narrow meanings in specialist domains, words like “electron,” “spelunker,”
and “hydrogen.” There are also many seemingly everyday words like “work,”
“heat,” and “temperature” that have become technical terms in science and do
not mean in science what they mean in everyday life.
This educational distinction among tiers of words is made because, by and
large, schooling involves a good deal of learning about tier 2 words, words
people use in non-vernacular speech and in school-based academic writing.
Many tier 2 words are from the Latinate vocabulary of English (and some are
derived from Greek).
So vocabulary in English is one marker of different styles of languages—
different registers or social languages. A preponderance of Germanic words
marks a style as less formal and more vernacular than a preponderance of
Latinate words, which marks a style as more formal. Many specialist and
academic domains incorporate a good deal of Latinate vocabulary and this
can be a barrier to people with limited education or literacy skills or who
consider such language off-putting for any of several reasons even if they
have these skills.
We can state another discourse analysis tool, the vocabulary tool:
Tool #8: The Vocabulary Tool
For any English communication, ask what sorts of words are being used in
terms of whether the communication uses a preponderance of Germanic words
or of Latinate words. How is this distribution of word types functioning to mark
this communication in terms of style (register, social language)? How does it
contribute to the purposes for communicating?
Problem 9
Consider the two utterances below. They were said by the same person, a
young woman (see Section 2.8 below for more on this data). In the first
case, she was talking to her boyfriend and in the second to her parents at
dinner. Discuss these two utterances in terms of the use they make of
Germanic and Latinate vocabulary. Think back also to our view that
speakers and writers are often active designers and builders. How is this
young women designing and building with language? Why has she done so
differently in each case?
 62 Saying, Doing, and Designing
1. He was hypocritical, in the sense that he professed to love her, then acted

2. What an ass that guy was, you know, her boyfriend. I should hope, if I

2.4 The Why This Way and Not That Way Tool
In the last section, we argued that we can look at words and phrases as bricks
and mortar for building (following the rules of grammar) structures and
meanings. We also argued that building also always involves making design
choices. We make choices about what to build (e.g., a noun phrase like
“children’s growth” in a sentence like “Children’s growth is spectacular” or a
verb like “grow” in a sentence like “Children grow spectacularly”), words and
types of words, available options, and ways to combine or avoid combining
certain words.
If we were to build a car, we would do so because we wanted to drive the
car (and maybe for other reasons, as well, for example to impress the
neighbors). In turn, we drive for all sorts of different reasons, in order to do
all sorts of things, for example to get to work, go shopping, take a vacation,
visit friends, and other things. So why do we build things with grammar? We
do so in order to make meanings. But, like driving, we make meanings for all
sorts of different reasons, in order to do all sorts of things (see the Doing Not
Saying Tool).
Having studied the Doing Not Saying Tool, we already know some of the
things we do with the meanings we make. Consider, for example, the following
utterances:
1. I will be at your party tonight
2. See you at the party tonight
3. We’re gonna party hard tonight, bro!
Each of these utterances informs the listener that the speaker will be at the
listener’s party, so one thing they are doing is informing. Utterance (1)
says so directly, and (2) and (3) say so indirectly. Utterances (2) and (3)
do something else, as well. They express bonding or solidarity with the
listener, while (1) is much more socially and emotionally neutral. In turn,
(3) is much more expressive of bonding and solidarity than is even (2). 
Saying, Doing, and Designing 63
The speaker has made different choices about how to build with grammar,
that is, made different design choices. Each different choice means
something different and in each meaning is being used to do something
different.
Our discussion of building and designing with grammar allows us to state a
new tool, “The Why This Way and Not That Way Tool.”
Tool #9: The Why This Way and Not That Way Tool
For any communication, ask why the speaker built and designed with
grammar in the way in which he or she did and not in some other way.
Always ask how else this could have been said and what the speaker was
trying to mean and do by saying it the way in which he or she did and not in
other ways.
This is not really a separate tool from the Fill In Tool or the Doing Not Saying
Tool. Rather, it is another way to get at what those tools are getting at. In
reality, we need to use all three of these tools together and hope they converge
on the same answers, since each of these tools gives us a somewhat different
angle on the data.
Grammar Interlude #5: Integrating Information
A clause is any string of words composed of a subject and predicate as in “The
boys liked the cakes.” In traditional grammar, a sentence is any clause that
stands complete by itself (e.g., “The boys liked the cakes”). A non-sentential
clause is any string of words with a subject and predicate that does not stand
complete by itself (e.g., “John thinks that the boys like the cakes,” where “the
boys like the cakes” is a clause, but “John thinks that the boys like the cakes”
is a sentence). Since I do not want to keep having to say “clause or sentence,”
I will call anything with a subject and predicate a clause, whether it is a clause
or a sentence in traditional terms.
The subject of a clause is always a noun or noun phrase (e.g., “Boys like
cake” or “The tall boys liked cake”). The direct object of a verb is also always
a noun or noun phrase (e.g., “like cake” or “like very small cakes”). The
predicate of a clause is always a verb or a verb phrase (e.g., “eat” or “eat small
cakes”).
Since a noun phrase can occur wherever a noun can occur and a verb phrase
can occur wherever a verb can, many linguists just count single nouns and
verbs as if they were phrases and call them (single word) noun phrases and
verb phrases. A small part of the syntactic rules for English are given below.
When an element is in parentheses it means it is optional. It can be there or
not:
 64 Saying, Doing, and Designing
Clause  Noun Phrase + Verb Phrase
(e.g., The boys liked the cakes)
Noun Phrase  (Art) (Adj.) Noun (Prep. Ph.)
(e.g., boys, the boy, the happy boys at the school, etc.)
Verb Phrase  Verb (Noun Phrase) (Prep. Ph.)
(e.g., eat, eat the cakes, eat at home, eat the cakes from home)
Verb Phrase  Verb (that) Clause
(e.g., think that the boys liked the cakes)
Prep. Ph.  Prep. + Noun Phrase
(e.g., into the house)
Clause  Clause and Clause
(e.g., John likes cake and Mary likes pie)
The subject, the object of the verb, and any prepositional phrases that go with
the verb are called the “arguments” of the verb. They are the phrases that spell
out what the verb means in the sense of being the actors and locations in the
drama the verb names. Thus, in a sentence like “The girl hit the boy on the
head,” the subject “the girl” (the “hitter”), the object “the boy” (the one being
hit), and “on the head” (where the hitting occurred) are the arguments of the
verb “hit.”
English has verbs like “be” and “have” whose arguments are a subject and
either an adjective phrase (e.g., “Mary is very happy”) or a noun phrase (“Mary
is the queen” or “Mary has the book”). These are called “predicate adjectives”
and “predicate nouns” in traditional grammar.
The simplest clauses are made up of a verb and only the elements the verb’s
meaning requires to be present (“required arguments”):
1a. Mary touched John [Subject verb Object]
1b. Mary is healthy [Subject be Predicate Adjective]
1c. Mary has a brother [Subject have Predicate Noun]
Clauses can be expanded by adding optional arguments to the verb:
2a. Mary touched John on the head
2b. Mary touched John with her lips
2c. Mary touched John on the head with her lips
Clauses can also be expanded by optional elements that are not arguments of
the verb but which modify either the verb or the whole clause in some way:
3a. Mary lightly touched John [“lightly” modifies the verb “touched”]
3b. Yesterday, Mary touched John [“yesterday” modifies the clause “Mary
touched John”]
3c. Fortunately, Mary is healthy [“fortunately” modifies the clause “Mary is healthy”]
3d. Mary, fortunately, has a brother [“fortunately” modifies the clause “Mary has
a brother”]
Saying, Doing, and Designing 65
Clauses can be combined or integrated more or less tightly together in four
ways. First is a “loose” way, when two or more clauses are combined by
coordination and each is a “main clause.” A “main clause” is any clause that
stands alone as a sentence or bears no relationship to any larger clause other
than coordination. So in “The boys like cake and the girls like pie,” the whole
sentence (“The boys like cake and the girls like pie”) is a main clause and both
sub-clauses (“The boys like cake,” “The girls like pie)—linked by coordination—
are main clauses:
4a. The boys like cake and the girls like pie
4b. The boys like cake but the girls like pie
Second, clauses can be combined in a somewhat less loose way, when one or
more clauses is juxtaposed as a subordinate clause to a main clause:
5a. While John was not looking, Mary touched him on the head. [“while”
introduces subordinate clause]
5b. Mary touched John on the head because he was causing trouble. [“because”
introduces subordinate clause]
Third, two clauses can be tightly integrated by having one clause embedded
inside another one:
6a. John felt Mary touch him on the head [= “Mary touched him on the head” is
embedded inside “John felt …”].
6b. John believed that Mary had touched him on the head [= “Mary touched
John on the head” is embedded inside “John believed …”].
6c. Mary planned to touch John on the head [= “(Mary) touched John on the
head” is embedded inside “Mary planned …”].
Note in (6c) that “Mary” is understood as the subject of “to touch John on the
head” but not expressed. This is common with infinitives (“to verb” forms like
“to eat” or “to plan”).
Fourth, in the tightest form of integration, a clause can be turned into a
phrase (losing its status as a clause). This can be done by changing a verb into
a noun as when we turn the verb “grow” into the noun “growth.” This process
is called “nominalization.” It allows us to change a clause like “Hornworms
grow” into the noun phrase “Hornworm growth.”
What I mean by “change a clause into a noun phrase” is that a noun
phrase like “Hornworm growth” contains a full clause’s worth of information
(“Hormworns grow”). When we turn a clause into a noun phrase we can
then use that noun phrase (which contains a full clause’s worth of
information) in a new clause and make new and quite complicated and
complex clauses, for example: “Hornworm growth exhibits significant
variation.”
 66 Saying, Doing, and Designing
We can also turn an adjective (e.g., “healthy,” “happy”) into a noun (e.g.,
“health,” “happiness”) and thus go from clauses like “John is healthy” and
“Mary is happy” to noun phrases like “John’s health” and “Mary’s happiness.”
Verbs (e.g., “abuse,” “smile”) can also be turned into adjectives (e.g.,
“abused,” “smiling”). This allows us to go from clauses like “He abuses children”
and “Children smile” to noun phrases like “abused children” (“Abused children
deserve help”) and “smiling children” (“Smiling children are cute”).
So far, in all of the cases above, we have been moving from clauses to
combinations of clauses or to clauses disappearing into phrases. But in
discourse analysis we usually must go the other way round. We have to start
with sentences that are composed of two or more (sometimes many more)
clauses (combined or integrated in the ways we have just discussed above and
a few others) and then take these sentences apart. That is, we have to ask what
clauses the sentences combine or integrate or transform. So, to give one
example, consider the case below:
7. When I was reading my textbook, I discovered that scientists think that
hornworm growth exhibits significant variation.
This sentence is quite complex and integrates a good deal of information. To see
how it integrates this information we have to take it apart. The main clause is “I
discovered that scientists think that hornworm growth exhibits a significant
amount of variation.” “When I was reading my textbook” is a subordinate clause
that has been added to this main clause by the subordinator “when.” “Scientists
think that hornworm growth exhibits significant variation” is an embedded clause
that has been embedded as the object of the verb “discover” using the word “that”
(which is optional). “Hornworm growth exhibits significant variation” is another
embedded clause that has been embedded as the object of the verb “think” using
the word “that.” The phrase “hornworm growth” encapsulates the clause
“hornworms grow” (it is a clause’s worth of information). The phrase “significant
variation” encapsulates the clause “something varies significantly.”
We can visually represent this complexity—the way several clauses worth
of information are integrated in various ways into a single sentence—as per
diagram on the next page.
We can also just list the clauses:
1. Main Clause: I discover that scientists think hornworm growth exhibits
significant variation.
2. Subordinate Clause: While I was reading my textbook
3. Embedded Clause: That scientists think hornworm growth exhibits
significant variation
4. Embedded Clause: That hornworms exhibit significant variation
5. Nominalization: Hornworm growth (hornworms grow)
6. Nominalization: Significant variation (something varies significantly)

Embedded Clause
Embedded Clause
(5) Hornworms

(6) Something

The point is that the single sentence “While reading my textbook, I discovered
that scientists think that hornworm growth exhibits significant variation”
integrates or packages together six clauses worth of information. Further,
each clause worth of information is integrated into the whole more or less
tightly (coordination is looser than subordination which is looser than
embedding which is looser than turning clauses into phrases).
Integrating or packaging clauses allows speakers to organize how they want
to present and represent information. It allows them to take a particular
perspective on the information they want to communicate. It is a key part of
designing and building with language.
For example, material placed in a subordinate clause is assumed and not
asserted; material placed in a main clause is foregrounded and asserted. So if I say,
“Even though they are different parties, Republicans and Democrats both serve
the rich (people in society),” I am assuming that Democrats and Republicans are
different parties and asserting that they both serve the rich. I take their being
different parties as less significant than the fact they serve the rich and not
significant enough to override the similarity that they both serve the rich.
If, on the other hand, I say “Even though Democrats and Republicans both
serve the rich, they are different parties,” I am assuming that they serve the
rich and am asserting they are different parties. Now I am taking the fact that
they serve the rich as less significant than that they are different parties and
taking the fact they are different parties to be significant enough to override
the fact that they both serve the rich. 
 68 Saying, Doing, and Designing
Embedded clauses are not asserted either. If I say “John told Jane’s husband
that she had cheated on him,” I am not myself asserting that Jane cheated on
her husband, though I might well, in some contexts, be suggesting it. But if I
say “Jane cheated on her husband and John told him so,” I am asserting that
she cheated on her husband.
When we turn a clause into a phrase often information is left out. If I say
“physically abused children need support,” “physically abused children” is a
noun phrase that encapsulates a clause’s worth of information: “someone
abuses children physically.” When we turn the clause into a phrase (use the
phrase version rather than a clause version) we can leave out the subject, that
is, we do not have to name who did the abusing. Thus, consider the sentence
below from a published piece of research (Pollak, S. D., Vardi, S., Putzer
Bechner, A. M., and Curtin, J. J. (2005), Physically abused children’s regulation
of attention in response to hostility,” Child Development 76.5: 968–77):
8. The present data suggest that once anger was introduced abused children
maintained a state of anticipatory monitoring of the environment.
The phrase “abused children” refers to the subjects in the experiment, so it
really means “the abused children (in this experiment).” The phrase is related
to the clause “someone abused the children.” If this was said as a clause, the
abuser would have to have been named in some fashion, since clauses require
subjects. In fact, in this study the children were physically abused by their
parents. The article says this at the beginning and thereafter uses the phrase
“physically abused children” or “abused children.”
The authors might have done this because, as in all technical writing, they
wanted to be concise. Or, perhaps, they did it, too, in part, because normally in an
experiment on children one gets permission from the children’s parents, but in this
case these were the same people who abused the children. The authors never really
confront this fact in the paper and the constant use of “abused children” effaces
both the parents and the dilemma about experimenting on children whose parents
are not necessarily in a good position to represent the best interests of their children.
We can state another grammatical tool for discourse analysis, The
Integration Tool:
Tool #10: The Integration Tool
For any communication, ask how clauses were integrated or packaged into
utterances or sentences. What was left out and what was included in terms of
optional arguments? What was left out and what was included when clauses
were turned into phrases? What perspectives are being communicated by the
way in which information is packaged into main, subordinate, and embedded
clauses, as well as into phrases that encapsulate a clause’s worth of information?
Saying, Doing, and Designing 69
Problem 10
Apply The Integration Tool to the sentence below (from the same research
paper as 8 above). That is, take the sentence apart in terms of what clauses it
is composed of and what phrases encapsulate a clause’s worth of information:
9. First, we sought to further examine the ways in which physically abused
children can regulate attentional processes when confronted with anger or
threat.
In this experiment the experimenters exposed five-year-old children who had
been physically abused by their parents to voices of adults getting angry at
each other. What has been left out in 9? [“processes” is a noun related to the
verb “process,” so it encapsulates the information “someone processes
something”; “attentional” is an adjective related to the verb “attend,” so it
encapsulates the information “someone attends to something”; “anger” is a
noun related to the predicate adjective “be/get angry,” so it encapsulates the
information “someone is/gets angry with someone” and “threat” is a noun
related to the verb “threaten,” so it encapsulates the information “someone
threatens someone”]. Who confronted the children with anger or threat?
Does “confront someone with threat” mean to “threaten them”? Who (if
anyone, in your view) threatened whom here?
Problem 11
Package or integrate the clauses below in as many ways as you can. [One way,
of course, is just to leave them all separate as in: “The book belonged to John.
It had a cover. The cover was green. The cover was torn.” You can add or leave
out “little words” to make the integrations work (e.g., “John’s book had a
green cover that was torn”). Reflect on whatever differences of meaning there
are among the different ways of combining these clauses:
10a. The book had a cover
10b. The book had a green cover
10c. The cover was torn
10d. The book belonged to John
Do the same for the clauses below (again, you can add or leave out “little
words” like “how” and you can change “significantly” to “significant,”
“develop” to “development,” and “vary” to “variation”). Of course, we can
leave the two clauses separate as in: “All children develop. But they develop in
significantly different ways.”
11a. All children develop
11b. Children vary significantly in how they develop

2.5 Working with the Why This Way and Not That Way Tool
The Why This Way and Not That Way Tool tells us to always ask why
something was said the way it was and not some other way. One way to
operate with this tool is to ask yourself the ways in which any data you are
analyzing could have been said differently. Then ask why it was said the way
it was and not the other ways. Below, you will get some practice with the Why
This Way and Not That Way Tool.
Problem 12
Consider the following sentences from Paul Gagnon’s book Democracy’s
Untold Story: What World History Textbooks Neglect (Washington, D.C.:
American Federation of Teachers, 1987, pp. 65–71):
Also secure, by 1689, was the principle of representative government, as tested
against the two criteria for valid constitutions proposed in the previous chapter. As
to the first criterion, there was a genuine balance of power in English society,
expressing itself in the Whig and Tory parties. As narrowly confined to the privileged
classes as these were, they nonetheless represented different factions and tendencies.
Elections meant real choice among separate, contending parties and personalities.
Consider the sentence: “As narrowly confined to the privileged classes as
these were, they nonetheless represented different factions and tendencies.”
Let’s change it slightly to: “As narrowly confined to the privileged classes as
these were, the Whig and Tory parties nonetheless represented different
factions and tendencies.” Below I give two different ways to say this
information:
1. As narrowly confined to the privileged classes as these were, the Whig
and Tory parties nonetheless represented different factions and tendencies.
2. Though they represented different factions and tendencies, nevertheless,
the Whig and Tory parties were narrowly confined to the privileged classes.
What is the difference grammatically and in meaning between these two?
Why didn’t Gagnon write version (2) instead of (1)?
Problem 13
Consider the next two sentences:
Saying, Doing, and Designing 71
1. Hornworms sure vary a lot in how well they grow.
2. Hornworm growth exhibits a significant amount of variation.
These two sentences are built and designed in very different ways. Why did
the speaker of (1) say it that way and not some other way, for example as in
(2)? Why did the speaker of (2) say it that way and not some other way, for
example as in (1)?
List all the grammatical differences between (1) and (2)—all the different
choices the speakers made about how to use grammar, how to build and
design with grammar. For each difference, say why the speaker said it that
way and not the other way. For example, why is the subject of (1) “hornworms”
and the subject of (2) “Hornworm growth”?
Considering all the choices made, what do you think the speaker of each
utterance is trying to do, to accomplish?
Though these are both spoken utterances, if you did not know that, which
utterance would you have thought more likely to have been written and why?
It sounds odd to say or write “Hornworm growth sure exhibits a significant
amount of variation?.” Why?
Grammar Interlude #6: Topics and Themes
We saw in Grammar Interlude #2 in Unit 1 that clauses are made up of
subjects and predicates. There we said that the subject of a clause is its
“topic.” The word topic has a lot of different meanings. Here it means the
entity in the clause that the predicate is about. If I say “Mary got into
Stanford,” I am saying about Mary that she got into Stanford. If I say
“Stanford admitted Mary,” I am saying about Stanford that it admitted Mary.
If I ask “Did Mary get into Stanford?,” I am asking about Mary whether she
got into Stanford.
While the subjects of clauses are always “topics” (this is their general
meaning), in different situations of use, subjects take on a range of more
specific meanings. In a debate, if I say, “The constitution only protects the
rich,” the subject of the sentence (“the constitution”) is an entity about
which an assertion is being made; if a friend of yours has just arrived and I
usher her in saying “Mary’s here,” the subject of the sentence (“Mary”) is a
center of interest or attention; and in a situation where I am commiserating
with a friend and say something like “You really got cheated by that guy,”
the subject of the sentence (“you”) is a center of empathy (signaled also by
the fact that the normal subject of the active version of the sentence—“That
guy really cheated you”—has been “demoted” from subject position through
use of the “get-passive”). There are other possibilities as well.
There is another important discourse notion, closely related to the notion
of “topic,” and that is “theme.” [This word has been used in many different
ways in the linguistics literature; I am using here in the way in which the 
 72 Saying, Doing, and Designing
linguist M. A. K. Halliday does.] The “theme” of a clause is the point of
departure of the message, a framework for the interpretation of the clause.
The theme orients the listener to what is about to be communicated. In
English, the theme of a clause is whatever comes before the subject. If
nothing comes before the subject, then the subject is both the theme and the
topic. So in “Stanford admitted Mary last year,” “Stanford” is the subject,
topic, and theme. In “Last year, Stanford admitted Mary,” “last year” is the
theme and “Stanford” is the subject and topic.
Theme is really a position in the clause, not just necessarily one
constituent. So in a sentence like “Well, last year, on her birthday, Mary got
into Stanford,” all the material before the subject—“Well, last year, on her
birthday”—is a multi-part theme. Grammatical words like “well” and other
interjections, conjunctions (e.g., “and,” “but,” “so”), and conjunctive
adjuncts (e.g., “however, because, though, therefore) are often called
“textual themes,” since they help tie clauses and sentences together and
have less content than things like “last year” and “on her birthday.” So we
can distinguish between textual themes (like “well”) and what we might call
non-textual more contentful themes (like “on her birthday”; Halliday calls
them “interpersonal themes”). I will use “textual theme” for textual themes
and just the word “theme” for the more contentful themes.
Sometimes the subject of a sentence is left out of a clause because it can
be recovered from context, as in the sentence: “In this project, we lay the
ground work for developing a potentially transformational approach to
assessment in the twenty-first century.” Here “we” is understood as the
subject of “developing” (i.e., “our developing”), but has been left out. So,
too, in “John left my house at five and went home,” where “John” is
understood as the subject of “went home.” Subjects that are left out still
count as topics and themes (if there is nothing in front of them in their
clause).
The “theme” creates the perspective from which everything else in the
clause or sentence is viewed. It is the launching off point for the rest of the
information in the clause or sentence. It sets the framework or context in
which we view the information in the rest of the clause or sentence. The
normal or usual case in English—what linguists call the “unmarked” case—
is for the subject of the clause to be both theme (thereby first) and topic.
When something other than the subject is first and thereby theme (as in
“Last year, Stanford admitted Mary”), the choice of theme is what linguists
call “marked” (less usual).
If I say, “Regrettably, the big girl hit the small boy” (theme = “regrettably”;
topic = “the big girl”), then I am viewing the claim that the big girl hit the
small boy through the lens of my regret about the matter. If I say, “The big
girl, regrettably, hit the small boy” (theme = topic = “the big girl”), then I am
viewing both the action of hitting and my feelings of regret about the matter
through the lens of what I think or feel about the big girl.
Saying, Doing, and Designing 73
Each clause has its topic and theme. When a sentence contains more than
one clause, the whole sentence can have a theme in addition to each clause
in it having its own theme. Anything that occurs before the subject of the
main clause is the theme of the multi-clause sentence. If nothing occurs
before the main clause subject that subject is the theme of the multi-clause
sentence.
So consider the sentence: “Though Mary loves John, she treats him
poorly.” Here “though” is a textual theme and “Mary” is the topic/theme of
the clause “Mary loves John” and “she” is the topic/ theme of the clause “she
treats him poorly.” However, since “Though Mary loves John” precedes the
subject of the main clause (“she” in “she treats him poorly), it is the theme
of the whole two-clause sentence. In “Mary treats John poorly, though she
loves him,” nothing is before the main clause subject (“Mary” in “Mary
treats John poorly”) and, thus, “Mary” is the theme of its own clause and the
whole sentence.
In Section 1.4 we saw the following utterance:
LAST YEAR / Mary Washington / who is our curriculum coordinator here / had
a call from Sara //
The speaker is a teacher in the first official meeting of a project organized by
academics (including Sara) at a local university. She has been asked to open
the meeting by catching everyone up to date on what has gone on among
various people prior to the meeting. The meeting is being held in her school.
The teacher, later in the meeting, makes clear that she and other teachers
had put in a good deal of effort in helping to organize the project prior to the
first meeting and that it had, from her point of view, taken the academics too
long to call the first official meeting. Thus, she makes “last year” the theme
of her opening clause and even gives it emphatic stress. This is a marked
theme (less usual), since the usual (unmarked) way to say this would have
been to say “Mary Washington who is our curriculum coordinator here had
a call from Sara last year.” By making the less usual (marked) choice the
speaker is making “last year” significant.
By making “last year” the theme of her opening clause, the teacher is
making that the framework within which what follows is to be interpreted.
In this case, this includes not just the clause of which “last year” is the
theme, but a good deal of what else follows this clause in her extended turn
at talk. She wants to make clear that what has gone on prior to the meeting,
in terms of her efforts and those of other teachers, has gone on too long
without the academics calling a meeting and getting involved themselves.
She wants listeners to use the lapse of year as a framework with which to
understand what she is saying.
We can state another grammatical tool for discourse analysis:
 74 Saying, Doing, and Designing
Tool #11: The Topic and Theme Tool
For any communication, ask what the topic and theme is for each clause and
what the theme is of a set of clauses in a sentence with more than one clause.
Why were these choices made? When the theme is not the subject/topic, and,
thus, has deviated from the usual (unmarked) choice, what is it and why was it
chosen?
In Section 1.4 we saw the following utterance (I print the data here to look
more like print with clear sentence boundaries):
And we um BOTH expected to be around for the summer institute at Woodson. I
DID participate in it. But SARA wasn’t able to do THAT.
“And” and “but” are textual themes. How is “but” functioning here to create a
context or framework for interpretation (the role of themes)? What difference
would it made if the speaker had said “I did participate in it. Sara, however,
wasn’t able to”? How do putting emphatic stress on “did” and “Sara” and “that”
and using “but” as textual theme all work together to communicate here?
Problem 14
Consider the written sentences below from a grant proposal:
In this project, we lay the ground work for developing a potentially transformational
approach to assessment in the 21st century. Today, work that requires only basic
skills flows overseas where labor is cheaper.
Discuss what themes were chosen in this communication and how they
function (i.e., how are they setting up frameworks for interpretation?). This is
from a proposal asking for funds (a grant proposal). Does this help explain the
choice of themes? How is the version below different from the version above?
We lay the ground work for developing a potentially transformational approach
to assessment in the 21st century in this project. Work today that requires only
basic skills flows overseas where labor is cheaper.
Problem 15
Consider the four following sentences, sentences which say pretty much (but,
of course, not exactly, the same thing). Say what the topics and themes are in
each case, why they might have been chosen as they were, and how the
different choices in each case communicate somewhat different things:
Saying, Doing, and Designing 75
1. For no good reason, the stupid company she works for fired my daughter.
2. The stupid company she works for fired my daughter for no good reason.
3. For no good reason, my daughter was fired by the stupid company she
works for.
4. My daughter was fired by the stupid company she works for for no good
reason.

2.6 Why We Build and Design with Grammar
In Section 2.5, I asked you to think about the two utterances below:
1. Hornworms sure vary a lot in how well they grow.
2. Hornworm growth exhibits a significant amount of variation.
Let’s look at some of the different choices in how to build with grammar these
two utterances represent. Then we can ask why these choices were made,
what they mean, and what they allow the speaker to accomplish (do).
Subjects of sentences name what a sentence is about (its “topic”). They also
name the perspective from which we are viewing the claims we want to make
(its “theme”) if they are initial in the sentence.
Sentence (1) above is about hornworms (cute little green worms) and
launches off from the perspective of the hornworm. Sentence (2) is not about
hornworms, but about a trait or feature of hornworms, namely “hornworm
growth,” in particular one that can be quantified, and launches off from this
perspective.
In sentence (1) “sure” is an emotive or affective marker indicating that the
speaker is impressed or surprised. The affective marker communicates the
attitude, interest, and even values of the speaker/writer. Sentence (2) not only
does not have “sure” in it, the presence of “sure” would make the sentence
sound odd: “Hornworms sure display a significant amount of variation.”
Attitudes, interest, and/or values seem out of place or “odd” in sentence (2).
Why do you think that is?
Sentence (1) involves dynamic processes (changes) named by verbs (“vary,”
“grow”). Sentence (2) turns these dynamic processes into abstract things
(“variation,” “growth”) through a linguistic device known as “nominalization.”
Sentence (1) has a contentful verb (“vary”). Sentence (2) has a verb of
appearance (“exhibit”), a class of verbs that is similar to copulas (i.e., verbs
like “be”). Such verbs are not as deeply or richly contentful as verbs like
“vary.” Such copulative and appearance verbs are basically just ways to relate 
 76 Saying, Doing, and Designing
things to each other (in this case, abstract things, namely hornworm growth
and significant variation).
Sentence 2 contains the phrase “vary a lot in how well they grow” (a verb
phrase). What determines that the hornworms do, indeed, vary a lot? The fact
that the speaker has seen them. This utterance is from a child who was raising
hornworms in her classroom. The claim that the hornworms vary a lot in how
well they grow is her opinion based on raising, studying, and looking at her
hornworms. Some seem so small and others so big. The standard by which she
judges that this difference is “a lot” is her own viewpoint (“the evidence of her
own eyes”), that it just seems like a big difference.
Sentence (2) contains, not the phrase “vary a lot in how well they grown,”
but “display a significant amount of variation.” What determines here that the
variation is, indeed, “significant” (the “equivalent” of sentence (1)’s “a lot”)?
Not the speaker’s opinion or what he or she has seen. “Significant” here is
about an amount that is evaluated in terms of the goals and procedures of an
academic discipline (here a type of biology), not just a single person. It is a
particular area of biology, its theories, and its statistical tests that determines
what amounts to significant variation and what does not. All our hornworms
could be stunted or untypical of well grown hornworms (“well grown” from
non-specialist everyday perspective) and still display a significant amount of
variation in their sizes in terms of a statistical test of significance. How they
look is “trumped” by the statistical tests the discipline of biology gives us.
So there are lots of differences between sentence (1) and (2) in how they
were built and designed from the rules of grammar. But what do these
differences mean and accomplish? Sentence (1) and (2) are, in fact, different
styles or varieties of language. They are what we will later call two different
“social languages” (see Section 4.4).
Sentence (1) is in a vernacular style. The vernacular is the style we use
when we are speaking as “everyday people,” making no claims to expert or
specialist status or knowledge. Each of us has a vernacular style, though this
style differs for different dialects and cultures.
Sentence (2) is in a specialist style of language. Specialist styles are used by
experts or specialists when they are speaking and acting as experts and
specialists (when they are not, they use a vernacular style).
The choices of how to use grammar in sentence (1) are partly meant to convey
that one is speaking as an “everyday person” making claims based on one’s own
opinion and inspection of the world. The choices in sentence (2) are partly
meant to convey that one is speaking as an expert or specialist making claims
based not just on one’s own opinion and inspection of the world, but also on the
basis of a discipline’s formal theories, tools, and practices.
Of course, when we speak as “everyday people” we have our own informal
theories and ways of saying and doing things that we share with others in our
families and cultures. But experts and specialists make their theories and practices
more overt and public and share them well beyond their families and cultures.
Saying, Doing, and Designing 77
Sentence (2) uses grammar to build and design meanings that are part of an
enterprise that seeks to develop knowledge explicitly as part of a disciplinary
group of people engaged in a communal search for that knowledge (communal
in the sense of things like shared training and peer review). This group of
people has a number of tools they have developed and which they share for
producing knowledge, tools like experimental apparatus, measuring devices,
and statistical tests. Their way of speaking and writing—their specialist style
of language—is also one of these tools, a tool for attempting to produce
knowledge.
Sentence (1) is in its own way communal too. The speaker, though
expressing her own opinion, one that is not backed up by a specialist group,
is surely assuming that if the hornworms look to her to vary a lot in how well
they grow, they will look that way to others. Her claim, especially with the
presence of “sure,” says that what she sees is or should be obvious and
apparent to “anyone.” But “anyone” here means “everyday people” not
specialists. Specialists have different standards than “everyday people”
(remember, it could look to us everyday people as if there were big differences
among our hornworms and yet the specialist’s statistical tests might claim
these differences were not “significant”).
What is important and what I want to stress is this: By using grammar to
build and design their utterances in different ways the speakers of sentences
(1) and (2) are helping to build something else, as well, something out there
in the world. The speaker of sentence (2) is helping to build and sustain the
domain of biology. By speaking biology’s style of language the speaker is
reproducing the domain of biology, keeping it going, even if he or she turns
out to be wrong about his or her specific claim.
The speaker of sentence (1) is helping to build and reproduce (continue,
sustain) what we can call the “life world.” The life world is the domain where
we speak, value, and act as “everyday people” making claims based on
“everyday knowledge,” “common sense,” or the sorts of evidence gathering
any “everyday person” can do.
People’s life worlds differ by their cultures. Different cultures, even within
a country like the United States, have different standards for what counts as
“everyday knowledge,” “common sense,” and evidence open to anyone.
However, in the modern world, there is often a conflict between the life world
and specialist claims to knowledge. We often have trouble knowing which we
should trust. Furthermore, specialist knowledge over the last two centuries
has, for better and worse, greatly eroded the space within which everyday
people can comfortably claim to know things.

2.7 Using Language to Build Things in the World
So far in this unit, we have discussed how grammar allows us to build phrases
and sentences so we can convey meanings and carry out actions. When we
choose words and build phrases and sentences with grammar, we are giving
clues or cues or recipes (whatever we want to call them) to listeners about
how to construct a picture in their heads. Our choice of what sorts of phrases
to use, what words to put in them, and how to combine words and phrases is
determined by the sort of picture we want listeners to form in their heads.
For example, imagine someone says to you: “My daughter got a
PROMOTION at the agency” (with emphatic stress on “promotion”). This
utterance has been built in a certain way. The word “daughter” tells you, the
listener, to form a picture of a female child (in this case an adult female child).
“My” tells you to connect the daughter to the speaker as his child. “My
daughter got a PROMOTION” tells you to connect a promotion to the daughter
in your head.
Every aspect of the choices a speaker has made has implications for the
picture the listener is supposed to build in his or her mind. The speaker here
has chosen “my daughter” as the subject (and, thus, too the topic). He could
have chosen “the agency” as the subject and topic (e.g., “The agency promoted
my daughter”). He chose the wording “got a promotion” instead of “was
promoted” (e.g., “My daughter was promoted at the agency”). He chose to put
emphatic stress on “promotion” when he could have failed to do so (“My
daughter got a promotion at work”). He chose to say “the agency” rather than,
say, “her company” or “the FBI.”
The way this utterance is built tells you to construct a picture in your head
in which the agency promoted the speaker’s daughter. Since “my daughter” is
the subject and topic (and theme), you must make the picture about her and
not, say, the agency.
The use of “the agency” implies you will already know what agency the
daughter works for (e.g., from previous encounters). So you have to take
this information out of memory and put it into your mental picture (let’s say
you know it’s the FBI). Indeed, the picture you form in your mind is
determined, as we know, not just by what was said, but by the context in
which it was said.
The phrasing “got a promotion,” rather than the more neutral “was
promoted,” expresses the speaker’s empathy for the daughter and the feeling
that something specially good happened to her. So this is added to your mental
picture as well. 
Saying, Doing, and Designing 79
The emphatic stress on “promotion” shows that the promotion was a
surprising, happy, or otherwise special event. You determine which from your
knowledge of the context and put that in your mental picture, too.
Based on context (e.g., what you know about the speaker and your previous
interactions with the speaker), you may (using the “Fill In Tool”) put a good
deal more in your mental picture than this. You may know, for example, that
the speaker’s daughter is just a beginner at the FBI and, thus, that the speaker
intends you to take the promotion as an unexpected big deal. Or you may
know the daughter has worked at the FBI for years and been regularly passed
over for promotion and, thus, that the speaker really means something like
“My daughter FINALLY got a promotion at work.”
Listeners may take the pictures they form in their minds (based on the way
utterances are built, as well as on context) to be real (true), possible, or unreal
(untrue). For example, you may know that the speaker is an inveterate liar, but
you still form a picture of his daughter getting a somehow special promotion in
your mind. You just count this picture as at best possible, if not unreal.
We do not know from research, as of yet, what these pictures in the mind
are made of in terms what is in the brain. They may be based on our capacity
to form images or on some sort of language-like symbol system in our heads,
or some combination of these. They have been called by a variety of names,
such as “mental models,” “discourse models,” “discourse records,” and
“possible worlds.”
So in building with grammar we make meanings that combined with
context allow listeners to build pictures in their minds that are taken as true,
possible, or as untrue of the world. This is what building with grammar
amounts to.
However, we use language to get people to construct pictures in their minds
for many different purposes. We speak and put pictures in people’s heads
because we want to make things happen in the world. We want to do things
and not just say them. And in order to do these things we engage in yet another
sort of building, what we might call “world building.” We build (or destroy,
for that matter) not grammatical things, but things out in the world.
For instance, in the last section, we saw that a biologist who speaks and
writes in the language of biology (makes choices about grammar that fit that
style of language) is actually helping to build, produce, reproduce, and sustain
the enterprise of biology out in the world. And that enterprise involves not
just people, but institutions, like university biology departments, biology
journals, and biology associations and conferences, as well.
We use language (we build with grammar) so that we can also build things
out in the world, make things happen, try to make them true. Let me give one
example (we will study this process in the next unit). The example will be
oversimplified to make my point.
How do spouses build and sustain relationships? They do things for and
with each other and they speak to each other in certain ways. Consider, then, 
 80 Saying, Doing, and Designing
the following. A wife has given her husband two ties as a gift. He comes
happily into the room wearing one. She says: “You didn’t like the other one?”
This is a “double-bind” communication. The husband cannot win, whatever
tie he puts on, his wife will say this and imply he did not like the other one.
Enough communication like this and the wife has not built something in the
world with language, but, rather, destroyed it, namely her relationship.
On the other hand, formulating one’s communications with one’s spouse in
supportive, collaborative, and loving ways can solidify and sustain a
relationship. Two things are clear from this simple example. First, how we
speak has consequences in the world, it can build things up or tear them
down. In this case, we are talking about building up or tearing down
relationships, but we will talk about building up and tearing down other sorts
of things, as well, later.
Second, language is rarely used all alone in this building up or tearing down
process. Actions and bodies count, as well, so do circumstances in the world.
A husband who works in the garage all day and spends no time with his wife
is tearing down the relationship. A wife who fails to ever look at or touch her
husband is tearing down the relationship. Dire poverty can tear apart
relationships as well. In the world, language almost always works in tandem
with non-language “stuff” (bodies, actions, objects, and circumstances).
What this means is that the meanings we build through grammar—and the
mental pictures this lets us help people construct—are really tools. They are
tools for doing things and one of the things we do with these tools is build
things (such as academic disciplines like biology) and destroy things (such as
marriages) in the world.

Grammar Interlude #7: Stanzas
We saw in Grammar Interlude #3 that speech is produced in tone units or idea
units. These units are usually, but not always, one clause long. The information
embraced within a single idea unit of speech is, of course, most often too small
to handle all that the speaker wants to say. It is usually necessary to integrate
several idea units into a larger block of information.
Speech is often organized into groups of idea units that I will call “stanzas.”
Each stanza is a group of idea units about one important event, happening, or
state of affairs at one time and place, or it focuses on a specific character,
theme, image, topic, or perspective. When time, place, character, event, or 
Saying, Doing, and Designing 81
perspective changes, we usually get a new stanza. I use this term (“stanza”)
because these units are somewhat like stanzas in poetry.
Within a larger genre of language—like a narrative, a description, an
explanation, and exposition—the stanzas are themselves often grouped into
larger blocks of information that serve a role in the whole narrative, description,
explanation, exposition, or whatever genre is being used.
Below, I lay out the idea units and stanzas in the opening of the story a
seven-year-old African-American told in school during sharing time. Each
numbered line is an idea unit:
SETTING OF STORY:
STANZA 1 (getting stuck):
1. last yesterday
2. when my father
3. in the morning
4. an’ he ...
5. there was a hook
6. on the top of the stairway
7. an’ my father was pickin me up
8. an’ I got stuck on the hook
9. up there
STANZA 2 (having breakfast):
10. an’ I hadn’t had breakfast
1l. he wouldn’t take me down
12. until I finished all my breakfast
13. cause I didn’t like oatmeal either
Note here how the first stanza is about getting stuck on the hook and the
second is about having breakfast. The two together serve as the setting for the
girl’s story, which we will see in a moment. These are two blocks of information.
Connected speech is like a set of boxes within boxes. Idea units, most of
which are single clauses, are grouped together into a stanza as one block of
information. Then one or more (usually more) stanzas can constitute a yet
larger unit like the setting for a story or an explanation within an argument.
Larger pieces of information, like a story about my summer vacation, an
argument for higher taxes, or a description of a plan for redistributing wealth,
have their own characteristic, higher-level organizations. That is, such large
bodies of information have characteristic parts much like the body has parts
(the face, trunk, hands, legs, etc.). These parts are the largest parts out of
which the body or the information is composed. The setting of the child’s
story we have been discussing is a piece of the larger organization of her story.
It is a “body part” of her story.
Below, I reprint this child’s story as whole. Each larger “body part” of the
story is numbered with a Roman numeral and labeled in bold capitals 
 82 Saying, Doing, and Designing
(SETTING, CATALYST, CRISIS, EVALUATION, RESOLUTION, and CODA).
In order to see the patterning in the little girl’s story all the more clearly, I do
something a bit different below in the way I represent the numbered lines and
stanzas. I remove from the girl’s story the various sorts of speech hesitations
and dysfluencies that are part and parcel of all speech (and that tell us
something about how planning is going on in the speaker’s head). I also place
the little girl’s idea units back into clauses when they are not full clauses (save
for “last yesterday” which is a temporal adverb with scope over most of the
story). What I have produced here, then, is an idealized representation
intended to make the structure of the girl’s story clearer.
A Seven Year Old Child’s Story
PART I: SETTING
STANZA 1
1. Last yesterday in the morning
2. there was a hook on the top of the stairway
3. an’ my father was pickin’ me up
4. an I got stuck on the hook up there
STANZA 2
5. an’ I hadn’t had breakfast
6. he wouldn’t take me down
7. until I finished all my breakfast
8. cause I didn’t like oatmeal either
PART II: CATALYST
STANZA 3
9. an’ then my puppy came
10. he was asleep
11. he tried to get up
12. an’ he ripped my pants
13. an’ he dropped the oatmeal all over him
STANZA 4
14. an’ my father came
15. an he said “did you eat all the oatmeal?”
16. he said “where’s the bowl?”
17. I said “I think the dog took it”
18. “Well I think I’ll have t’make another bowl”
PART III: CRISIS
STANZA 5
19. an’ so I didn’t leave till seven
20. an’ I took the bus
21. an’ my puppy he always be following me
22. my father said “he—you can’t go” 
Saying, Doing, and Designing 83
STANZA 6
23. an’ he followed me all the way to the bus stop
24. an’ I hadda go all the way back
25. by that time it was seven thirty
26. an’ then he kept followin’ me back and forth
27. an’ I hadda keep comin’ back
PART IV: EVALUATION
STANZA 7
28. an’ he always be followin’ me
29. when I go anywhere
30. he wants to go to the store
31. an’ only he could not go to places where we could go
32. like to the stores he could go
33. but he have to be chained up
PART V: RESOLUTION
STANZA 8
34. an’ we took him to the emergency
35. an’ see what was wrong with him
36. an’ he got a shot
37. an’ then he was crying
STANZA 9
38. an’ last yesterday, an’ now they put him asleep
39. an’ he’s still in the hospital
40. an’ the doctor said he got a shot because
41. he was nervous about my home that I had
PART VI: CODA
STANZA 10
42. an’ he could still stay but
43. he thought he wasn’t gonna be able to let him go
This girl’s story has a higher-order structure made up of a SETTING, which
sets the scene in terms of time, space, and characters; a CATALYST, which
sets a problem; a CRISIS, which builds the problem to the point of requiring a
resolution; an EVALUATION, which is material that makes clear why the
story is interesting and tellable; a RESOLUTION, which solves the problem
set by the story; and a CODA, which closes the story. Each part of the story
(except the Evaluation and Coda) is composed of two stanzas.
In some ways this is the structure of all stories, regardless of what culture
or age group is telling them. However, there are also aspects of story structure
that are specific to one cultural group and not another. For example, devoting
a block of information to an Evaluation prior to a story’s Resolution is more
common among children than it is among adults. Adults tend to spread such
Evaluation material throughout the story or to place it at the beginning. Some 
 84 Saying, Doing, and Designing
African-Americans engage in a good many “performance” features, which are
a type of Evaluation, and tend to use Evaluation material to “key” a hearer into
the point of the story, rather than to hit them over the head with the point
bluntly indicated. Of course, such cultural information is never true in any
very exclusive way: there are many varieties of African-American culture, as
there are of any culture (and some African-Americans are in no variety of
African-culture, but in some other variety of culture or cultures). And other
groups do similar or overlapping sorts of things.
Another aspect of this story that is more specific to African-American
culture, though also in a non-exclusive way, is the large amount of parallelism
found in the way language is patterned within the stanzas. Note, to take one
example of many, how Stanza 3 says “an’ then my puppy came” and then gives
four things about the puppy, and then Stanza 4 says “an then my father came”
and then says four things (all of them speech) about the humans involved.
This parallel treatment of the father and the puppy forces the hearer to see the
story as, in part, about the conflict between the puppy as a young and
exuberant creature and the adult world (home and father) as a place of order
and discipline. As a seven year child, the teller of the story is herself caught in
the conflict between her own urges to go free and her duty to go to school and
ultimately enter the adult world.
Notice that the part of the story labeled Evaluation makes clear that the
essential problem with the puppy is that he wants to freely go places where he
cannot go, just as, we may assume, a child often wants to go where she is not
allowed to go and must go where she doesn’t want to go. In line 21, the child
says “My puppy he always be following me,” and repeats this in the Evaluation.
This “naked be” is a form in African-American Vernacular English that means
an action is habitual (regularly happens). Here it indicates that the puppy’s
urge to follow and go with the girl is not just a once or sometime thing, but a
regular and recurrent event that follows from the nature of the puppy. It is a
problem that must be resolved.
The resolution of the conflict between the puppy and the adult world takes
place at a hospital where a doctor (an adult) gives the puppy a shot and puts
him to “sleep.” Thus, the adult world dictates that in the conflict between
home and puppy, the adult norms must win. The child is working through her
own very real conflicts as to why she can’t have her puppy and, at a deeper
level, why she must be socialized into the adult world of order, duty, and
discipline (by the way, while it is not clear what the hook in the first stanza is,
it does appear be just a dramatic device—the child seems to be trying to say
that her parents require discipline in the home; she is not, by any means,
accusing anyone of mistreatment). This, in fact, is the basic function of
narrative: narrative is the way we make deep sense of problems that bother us.
Children have clearer and simpler stanza structure than adults and it is
easier to find their stanzas. Adult language is often more complex—idea units
can be longer and stanzas more complicated. Below is a stretch of speech from 
Saying, Doing, and Designing 85
a curriculum consultant talking to the teachers in the history project we have
seen several times before (you will see this data again in Section 3.15).
PART I: CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT
STANZA 1: Curriculum Development
1. There’s a there’s a big complicated process /
2. Of working through the materials /
3. Figuring out how to teach it //
4. Which is called curriculum development //
STANZA 2: Complicated
5. And that’s what we’re involved in now /
6. And it’s very murky /
7. And it’s very complicated /
8. And we we don’t know where we’re going /
9. But that’s an innate part of curriculum development /
10. Unfortunately /
11. Especially when you work with a group of people /
12. And you’re not just doing it yourself //
PART II: HELP
STANZA 3: WHY CURRICULUM CONSULTANTS ARE THERE
13. Um so and that’s where Sandy and I were hired /
14. As sort of the hired guns /
15. To come in and help facilitate it /
16. Because we know you don’t have the time //
STANZA 4: Sara and Ariel are different
17. Um and and um Sara and Ariel [two university professors] /
18. Didn’t don’t have the experience /
19. Of working in the classroom /
20. And they teach in a different structure /
21. Which is very different //
STANZA 5: Here to help
22. And so, so we’re there as the helping hands to give you /
23. To help you where you need /
24. And to act as sort of the interpreters /
25. And the shapers,
26. But in response to what is necessary //
STANZA 6: Here for you
27. I mean we’re not coming in to do something that we want to do //
28. We’re trying to facilitate what you want to do //
Note that the stanzas here are close to what in some forms of writing would
have been one complex sentence (e.g., “It’s an innate part of curriculum
development, unfortunately, that it is very complicated and people do not 
 86 Saying, Doing, and Designing
always know where they are going, especially when they work with a group of
people and not just by themselves”). Note also that stanzas often (but not
always) start with some hesitation or a discourse particle like “so” and end
with a final intonation contour (“//”).
When looking for stanzas, look for how idea units cluster into one small
topic, perspective, or “take” on things. Then look at how stanzas themselves
cluster together to form larger units of sense (e.g., a setting in a story) as part
of a larger stretch of speech (e.g. a story or an explanation). Note above how
two stanzas are devoted to defining curriculum development and then three
are devoted to explaining why the curriculum consultants are around. When
you are engaging in your own analyses, do not worry about being “exactly
right” about where the stanza boundaries are. You are trying, by placing
speech in stanzas, to be clear about what clusters of sense or meaning you as
a listener or interpreter have seen in a stretch of speech.
We can introduce another grammatical discourse tool:
Tool #12: The Stanza Tool
In any communication (that is long enough), look for stanzas and how stanzas
cluster into larger blocks of information. You will not always find them clearly
and easily, but when you do, they are an important aid to organizing your
interpretation of data and of how you can display that interpretation.
Problem 16
The data below is from the same long turn of speech by the curriculum
consultant above. Place this stretch of speech into stanzas and any higher
order blocks of information you think are present. You will see that one of the
virtues of looking for stanzas is that the process forces you to think hard about
how information is organized. You may well find ambiguous situations, cases
where it is hard to decide what clusters with what, but that is just the sort of
thing you want to discover as you seek to find meaning. Sometimes speakers
are clear about their blocks of information and sometimes they are less clear
or elide one thing into another.
1. So but we also don’t want to put any pressure /
2. I mean there shouldn’t be any pressure //
3. There should be something that’s fun to do /
4. And what works works /
5. And what doesn’t work goes by the wayside //
6. And um that’s all it can be /
7. You know something small /
8. That accomplished by the end of the semester // 
Saying, Doing, and Designing 87
9. But if it goes into something that is exciting /
10. And has potential /
11. And should be continued next year /
12. And should be given to other teachers /
13. And should maybe affect other schools in Middleview /
14. Then that’s where Sara’s working towards something more long term //
15. Where this could be maybe funded by NEH /
16. And to pay teachers /
17. And to pay for release time /
18. And pay for materials /
19. And pay for resources to come in /
20. And make it work on a larger scale //
21. So this is like a little pilot project that is /
22. I agree /
23. It’s very murky /
24. And it’s very frustrating /
25. But I see that as sort of inevitable /

3.1 The Context is Reflexive Tool
In the first unit we saw the importance of context. In the second Unit we saw
that we use grammar and words to design and build language structures with
meaning. We then argued that we use these meanings as cues or clues to guide
people to build (with the help of context, as well) pictures in their heads. We
want our listeners to build such pictures in their heads because we want to do
things in the world and we need other people to think and act in certain ways
in order to get them done. We use language to build and destroy things in the
world, things like our academic discipline, our church membership, our
ethnic affiliation, or our marriage. In this unit we are going to talk about the
sorts of things we use language (along with non-verbal actions, things, and
circumstances) to build in the world.
But first, we have to discuss context again. So far I have given you an
oversimplified view of context. In Section 1.2, I defined “context” as follows:
Context includes the physical setting in which the communication takes place
and everything in it; the bodies, eye gaze, gestures, and movements of those
present; all that has previously been said and done by those involved in the
communication; any shared knowledge those involved have, including cultural
knowledge, that is, knowledge of their own shared culture and any other cultures
that may be relevant in the context.
So far we have treated context as something that is just “there” surrounding
speech. Listeners consult both what a speaker has said and the context in
which it was said, put these together—kind of add them up—and thereby give
meaning to the speaker’s words. This view of context is too static. It leaves out
the power speakers have to shape how listeners view context. It also leaves out
the power of listeners to construe what counts as relevant in the context and
how the context should be viewed.
Language has a rather magical property: When we speak we build and
design what we have to say to fit the context in which we are communicating.
But, at the same time, how we speak—what we say and how we say it—helps
to create that very context. It seems, then, that we fit our language to a context
that our language, in turn, helps (in part) to create in the first place.
This is rather like the “chicken and egg” question: Which comes first? The
context we’re in, for example a university committee meeting? Or the language
and interactions we use, for example our committee ways of talking and
interacting (e.g., calling a question to force a vote)? Are we speaking and
acting this way because this is a committee meeting or is this a “committee
meeting” because we are speaking and acting this way? If institutions,
committees, and committee meetings didn’t already exist, our committee ways
of speaking and interacting wouldn’t mean anything or be possible. But, then,
too, if we did not speak and act in certain ways, committees would cease to
exist. 
Building Things in the World 91
Another way to look at the matter is this: We always actively use spoken
and written language to create or build the world of activities (e.g., committee
meetings), identities (e.g., committee chairs, members, facilitators and
obstructionists) and institutions (committees in universities and universities
themselves) around us. However, thanks to the workings of history and
culture, we often do this in more or less routine ways. These routines make
activities, identities, and institutions seem to exist as contexts apart from
language and action in the here and now. Nonetheless, these activities,
identities, and institutions have to be continuously and actively rebuilt in the
here and now. If we do not rebuild them again and again, they will cease to
exist. If we start rebuilding them in different ways, which modify them, then
they change. This is what accounts for change and transformation.
This property of context—namely that it is both there (and gives meaning
to what we do) and that we help to create it with our ways of speaking and
acting—is called the “reflexive” property of context. Speaking reflects context
and context reflects (is shaped by) speaking (what was said). If I stand in front
of a classroom as a professor and start to lecture, my way of speaking and
acting creates the context of a class session. On the other hand, if class sessions
and classrooms did not already exist as an institutional context in the world I
could not speak and act this way.
We can introduce a new tool for discourse analysis, based on the reflexive
property of context: the Context is Reflexive Tool. The tool is given below:
Tool #13: The Context is Reflexive Tool
When you use the Fill in Tool, the Doing and Not Just Saying Tool, the Frame
Problem Tool, and the Why This Way and Not That Way Tool, and all other
tools that require that you think about context (and not just what was said),
always ask yourself the following questions:
1. How is what the speaker is saying and how he or she is saying it helping to
create or shape (possibly even manipulate) what listeners will take as the
relevant context?
2. How is what the speaker is saying and how he or she is saying it helping to
reproduce contexts like this one (e.g., class sessions in a university), that is,
helping them to continue to exist through time and space?
3. Is the speaker reproducing contexts like this one unaware of aspects of the
context that if he or she thought about the matter consciously, he or she
would not want to reproduce?
4. Is what the speaker is saying and how he or she is saying it just, more or less,
replicating (repeating) contexts like this one or, in any respect, transforming
or changing them? No act of speaking in a context is ever totally identical in
every respect to another (e.g., every lecture is different somehow), but
sometimes the differences are small and not very significant and other times
they are larger and more significant.

3.2 Working with the Context is Reflexive Tool
In this section we will investigate some data in order to use the Context is
Reflexive Tool.
Problem 17
In the data below a college student has done an activity in class where the
students had to read a story and rank the characters in order from worst to
best in terms of how they had behaved morally. In the story, Gregory is
Abigail’s boyfriend. Abigail has done something bad in order to be able to see
Gregory, but when he finds out what it was, he disowns her. In the first
communication below, the young woman is telling her parents at the dinner
table about the task and why she ranked Gregory as the worst character in the
story. In the second, she is telling the same thing to her boyfriend in her
bedroom. Both of these are, of course, just portions of what she said.
To Parents at Dinner:
Well, when I thought about it, I don’t know, it seemed to me that Gregory should
be the most offensive. He showed no understanding for Abigail, when she told
him what she was forced to do. He was callous. He was hypocritical, in the sense
that he professed to love her, then acted like that.
To Boy Friend Late at Night:
What an ass that guy was, you know, her boyfriend. I should hope, if I ever did
that to see you, you would shoot the guy. He uses her and he says he loves her.
Roger never lies, you know what I mean?
Questions:
1. How is the way this young women is speaking—what she says and how she
says it—helping to create or shape the way the listener views the context?
2. How are the contexts of being at dinner with her parents and being in her
bedroom with her boyfriend determining how she speaks?
3. Which is more important here do you think, the way the young women
uses her language to shape the context or the way in which aspects of the
context that are in place (e.g., dinner, parents, boyfriend, bedroom) shape 
Building Things in the World 93
how she speaks? Do all young people speak this way to their parents at
dinner? Do you think she is actively trying to create or shape the contexts
in which she is speaking or more just reflecting what she assumes the
context to be?
4. Which version leaves more interpretive work (more Filling In) to be done
by the listener? Why does the young woman demand more such work in
one case than in the other? What does this have to do with creating or
assuming a context of a certain sort?
5. In which communication does the language sound more like the style of
language we expect at school? Why does the speaker speak “school like”
in one case and not the other? What does this have to do with creating or
assuming a context of a certain sort?
Problem 18
A foreign doctoral student in graduate school in the United States has, after
several years in her program, lost her PhD advisor. She needs to get another
one. She is talking to a professor who she wants as an advisor, but who is
reluctant to take her on as a student. Facing this reluctance, she says: “It’s
your job to help me, I need to learn.”
Questions:
1. What sort of context is this student seeking to create—or, at least,
assuming—given what she says and how she says it?
2. Do you think this is a successful thing to say to the professor to convince
him? How do you think the professor views the context?
3. If you say something like “It’s your job to help me, I need help,” who is
this more likely to work on, a nurse or an accountant? What about a
priest versus a business executive? What do your answers to these
questions tell you about how the student viewed the context or what
context she was trying to create?
4. Do you think this student was actively trying to manipulate the context,
that is, actively to shape how the listener saw the context and responded
to her language or that she did not understand the context of university
PhD students and their professors?
5. The professor in this case, after hearing this utterance, was even more
reluctant to take the student. Why do you think this was so? Would this
be true of all or most professors? Would the field they were in make any
difference?
6. The student is trying to get the professor to overcome his reluctance to
take her on as a student. She says “It’s your job to help me, I need to
learn.” Formulate in your own words another way to seek to accomplish
her goal here. What sort of context does your formulation assume or seek 
 94 Building Things in the World
to create? Does your formulation pretty much assume the context is a
certain way and try to fit it or does it actively seek to shape the context?
Or is it a mixture of the two? In what ways?
7. This student was in ESL (English as a Second Language) classes for a
few years. What she says is grammatical. In fact, her English grammar
was good. Is there anything else her ESL class should have taught her.
Why?
3.3 Building Tasks and Building Tools
In the last unit we argued that we use grammar and words to design and build
structures and their accompanying meanings. We build these structures and
meaning so that we can do things with language. One thing we do with
language is think: we use it to think with in our minds. In fact, some types of
human thought are much like silently talking to oneself. It also appears
humans think in terms of images and a mental language shared by all humans
regardless of their language.
Another thing we do with language is use it to perform actions in the world.
The actions we accomplish using language allow us to build or destroy things
in the world, things like institutions and marriages. We do not usually just
engage in a single isolated action and leave it at that. Rather, we have plans
and goals and engage in series of related actions in related contexts over long
periods of time. These longer term chains of action are usually done in order
to build something in the world (like an institution or a marriage) or to sustain
it across time. In this unit we are going to talk about the things we use language
to build in the world.
We continually and actively build and rebuild our worlds not just through
language, but through language used in tandem with other actions,
interactions, non-linguistic symbol systems, objects, tools, technologies, and
distinctive ways of thinking, valuing, feeling, and believing. Sometimes what
we build is quite similar to what we have built before (e.g., sustaining a good
marriage); sometimes it is not (e.g., starting a new career).
So language-in-use is a tool, not just for saying and doing things, but also,
used alongside other non-verbal tools, to build things in the world. Whenever
we speak or write, we always and simultaneously build one of seven things or
seven areas of “reality.” We often build more than one of these simultaneously
through the same words and deeds. Let’s call these seven things the “seven
building tasks” of language in use. In turn, since we use language to build
these seven things, a discourse analyst can ask seven different questions about
any piece of language-in-use. This gives us, in turn, seven new tools for
discourse analysis.
Below, I list the seven building tasks. We will take up each one in turn in
the following sections where we will develop a discourse analysis tool
connected to each one.
Building Things in the World 95
1. Significance:
We use language to make things significant (to give them meaning or value) in
certain ways. We build significance. As the saying goes, we make “mountains out
of mole hills.” Things are often not trivial or important all by themselves. We
humans make them trivial or important or something in between. If I say, “Guess
what? My daughter got a PROMOTION at the agency” I make the event more
significant and attention worthy than if I say “My daughter was finally promoted
at the agency.”
2. Activities:
I have already said that language is used not just to say things but to do them and
that even informing is a type of action. Thus, we use language to carry out actions
like promising and encouraging and a great many others. This is what the Doing
Not Just Saying Tool was about. However, we humans also enact what I will call
“activities,” using the word in a special and restricted way. By an “activity” I mean a
socially recognized and institutionally or culturally supported endeavor that usually
involves sequencing or combining actions in certain specified ways. Encouraging a
student is an action, mentoring the student is an activity. Telling someone something
about linguistics is an action (informing), lecturing on linguistics is an activity.
Often the term “practice” is used for what I am calling an activity.
We use language to get recognized as engaging in a certain sort of activity. A
graduate student who has lost her advisor after some time in a graduate program
and asks a professor “Will you be my advisor?” is making a request (an action we
do with language). But she is also engaged in the activity of seeking a new graduate
advisor in graduate school. This requires more than just the request. There is
more that needs to be said and done. For instance, the student has to be able to
talk about her background in the program, her knowledge and skills, and her
accomplishments in ways that impress the advisor without seeming too arrogant
or exaggerated.
3. Identities:
We use language to get recognized as taking on a certain identity or role, that is,
to build an identity here and now. For example, I talk and act in one way and I am
speaking and acting as the chair of the committee; at the next moment I talk and
act in a different way and I am speaking and acting as just one peer/colleague
speaking to another. Even if I have an official appointment as chair of the
committee, I am not always taken as acting as the chair, even during meetings.
Doctors talk and act differently to their patients when they are being doctors
than they do when they are talking as acquaintances or friends, even in their
offices. In fact, traditional authoritarian doctors and new humanistic doctors talk
and act differently to the patients, are different types of doctors. Humanistic
doctors try to talk less technically and more inclusively to their patients. One and
the same doctor can even switch between the two identities at different points or
in different activities in his or her treatment of a patient.
4. Relationships:
We use language to build and sustain relationships of all different kinds. We use
language to build relationships with other people and with groups and institutions. 
 96 Building Things in the World
For example, in a committee meeting, as chair of the committee, if I say “Prof.
Smith, I’m very sorry to have to move us on to the next agenda item,” I am
constructing a relatively formal and deferential relationship with Prof. Smith. On
the other hand, suppose I say, “Ed, it’s time to move on.” Now I am constructing
a relatively informal and less deferential relationship with the same person.
5. Politics (the distribution of social goods):
I am going to use the term “politics” in this book in a special way. By “politics” I
do not mean government and political parties. I mean any situation where the
distribution of social goods is at stake. By “social goods” I mean anything a social
group or society as a whole takes as a good worth having.
We use language to build and destroy social goods. For example, for most
people, treating them with respect is a social good and treating them with
disrespect is not. Speaking and acting respectfully and deferentially is to create
and distribute a social good.
However, there are also circumstances where people want to be treated not
deferentially, but with solidarity and bonding. Speaking and acting with solidarity
and bonding towards someone who wants my friendship is in that circumstance
to create and distribute a social good.
Why do I refer to this as “politics”? Because the distribution of social goods and
claims about them—goods like a person being taken as acceptable, normal,
important, respected, an “insider” or an “outsider,” or as being connected to
acceptable, normal, or important things (in the right circumstances)—are
ultimately what give people power and status in a society or not.
People obviously disagree about what are social goods in various circumstances.
They also sometimes fight over the distribution of social goods and demand their
share of them.
Let me give an example that shows that how we construct our sentences has
implications for building or destroying social goods. If I say “Microsoft loaded its
new operating system with bugs,” I treat Microsoft as purposeful and responsible,
perhaps even culpable. I am withholding a social good from them as an institution,
namely respect and a good reputation.
If I say, on the other hand, “Microsoft’s new operating system is loaded with
bugs,” I treat Microsoft as less purposeful and responsible, less culpable. I am still
withholding social goods, but not as much as before. Now it seems they did not
act intentionally, but, nonetheless, still put out a bad product.
If I say, “Like any highly innovative piece of new software, Microsoft’s new
operating system is loaded with bugs,” I have mitigated my withholding of social
goods further and even offered Microsoft some social goods, namely treating them
as innovative and as not really responsible for the bugs. How I phrase the matter
has implications for social goods like guilt and blame, legal responsibility or lack
of it, or Microsoft’s bad or good motives, and Microsoft’s reputation.
6. Connections
Things in the world can be seen as connected and relevant to each other (or not)
in a great many different ways. For example, if I say “Malaria kills many people in
poor countries” I have connected malaria and poverty. If I say “Malaria kills many
people across the globe,” I have not connected the two (though, in reality, Malaria 
Building Things in the World 97
kills many more poor people than richer ones). Some connections exist in the
world regardless of what we say and do (like malaria and poverty). Nonetheless,
we can still render these connections visible or not in our language.
Other connections do not exist so clearly in the world until we have worked—
partly through how we use language—to make them real. For example, many
politicians and media pundits have connected “socialism” and “government
public health care” in the United States so often that a great many Americans
think the two are inherently connected. However, these same people often do not
see Medicare and socialism as connected, despite the fact that Medicare is a
government public health plan for the elderly. Medicare has been around a long
time now, many people use it, and past debates about it are forgotten.
7. Sign Systems and Knowledge
We use language to build up or tear down various sign systems (communicational
systems) and different ways of knowing the world. There are many different
languages (e.g., Spanish, Russian, English). There are many different varieties of
any one language (e.g., different dialects, as well language varieties like the
language of lawyers, biologists, and hip-hop artists). There are communicative
systems that are not language (e.g., equations, graphs, images) or at least not just
language (e.g., hip hop, poetry, video games, ads with pictures and words). These
are all different sign systems.
All these different sign systems are important to the people who participate in
them. People are often deeply connected to and committed to their dialect.
Lawyers are committed to talking like lawyers. Hip hop fans are passionate. There
are even violent arguments over where and when Spanish should be spoken in the
United States. Physicists believe the language of mathematics is superior to
languages like English for explicit communication.
Furthermore, different sign systems represent different views of knowledge and
belief. As we said, physicists believe the language of mathematics is superior to
English for producing and communicating knowledge about the physical world.
Poets believe poetry is a higher form of knowing and insight; people who use
religious varieties of language believe these are a higher form knowing and insight.
Speakers of African-American Vernacular English believe there are some things
that can be expressed or felt in that dialect better than they can in Standard
English. So, too, for Spanish-English bilinguals who favor one language or the
other for different topics or emotions. Statisticians believe statistics is a deep way
of understanding reality, while some qualitative researchers do not or, at least,
believe the language of statistics has spread too far in our understanding of the
social world.
We can use language to make certain sign systems and certain forms of
knowledge and belief favored or not, relevant or privileged, “real” or not in given
situations, that is, we can build privilege or prestige for one sign system or way of
claiming knowledge over another. For example, I can talk and act so as to make
the knowledge and language of lawyers relevant (privileged) or not over “everyday
language” or over “non-lawyerly academic language” in our committee discussion
of facilitating the admission of more minority students.
I can talk and act as if Spanish is an inferior language or not. I can talk and act
so as to privilege the language of “controlled studies” (e.g., “controlled studies of
classrooms”) as “real evidence” or “real science,” or not. I can talk and act so as to 
 98 Building Things in the World
constitute the language of creationism as “scientific” and as a competitor with the
language of evolution, or not.
The Sign System and Knowledge Building task is clearly related to the Politics
task, since constructing privilege for a sign system or way of knowing the world
is to create and offer a social good. But the domain of sign systems (including the
world’s languages) and ways of knowing are especially important domains.
Consider the effort people have spent trying to build or destroy astrology or
creationism (“design science”) as “acceptable” and “true” ways of talking and
acting.
3.4 The Significance Building Tool
One thing we build with language is significance. We use language to make
things significant in certain ways or to downplay their significance in certain
ways. Things are not always trivial or important all by themselves. We humans
make them trivial or important or something in between. Thus, we can state
the first of our seven building tools:
Tool #14: The Significance Building Tool
For any communication, ask how words and grammatical devices are being
used to build up or lessen significance (importance, relevance) for certain things
and not others.
It is important to realize that any use of language is usually engaged in more
than one building task at once. Furthermore, often more than one word or
grammatical choice is contributing to any one building task.
There is one key grammatical choice that is central to building significance,
though many other grammatical devices are used to build or lessen
significance as well. What we choose to put in a main clause is foregrounded
information. What we choose to put in a subordinate clause is backgrounded
information. Foregrounded information is taken to be what is being focused
on here and now and, thus, is treated as the most significant information
here and now.
In a sentence like, “While I know I did wrong, I am basically a good person,”
the clause “I am basically a good person” is the main clause. It is also a
declarative clause (and not, for example, a question), thus it is the asserted
information, what the speaker is asserting or claiming. “While I know I did
wrong” is a subordinate clause and, thus, is not asserted, but just assumed as
background information. If listeners want to be cooperative listeners (and
they don’t always), they are supposed to respond to (agree with or disagree
with) the asserted information and not the background information.
Background information is information they are supposed to assume or take
for granted.
Building Things in the World 99
A sentence like “While I am basically a good person, I know I did wrong”
reverses the foreground and background. Now “I know I did wrong” is
foregrounded and asserted and “I am basically a good person” is background
and assumed taken-for-granted information.
In a question like “Since I haven’t heard yet, what was the outcome of the
meeting?,” the clause “what was the outcome of the meeting?” is foregrounded and
achieves the main speech action here (asking a question). “Since I haven’t heard yet”
is background information. Cooperative listeners don’t say “What do you mean you
haven’t heard yet?” or “Why haven’t you heard?,” but answer the question.
In Section 2.5 you reflected on some data from Paul Gagnon’s book
Democracy’s Untold Story: What World History Textbooks Neglect (Washington,
D.C.: American Federation of Teachers, 1987, pp. 65–71). Here I want to
reflect on that data a bit to make my point about foregrounding information
and backgrounding as a way to engage in the Significance Building Task.
Below I repeat the quote from Gagnon’s book:
Also secure, by 1689, was the principle of representative government, as tested
against the two criteria for valid constitutions proposed in the previous chapter.
As to the first criterion, there was a genuine balance of power in English society,
expressing itself in the Whig and Tory parties. As narrowly confined to the
privileged classes as these were, they nonetheless represented different factions
and tendencies. Elections meant real choice among separate, contending parties
and personalities.
Let me rewrite a part of Gagnon’s text, changing what is a main clause and,
thus, foregrounded and what is a subordinate clause, and, thus, backgrounded:
Though they represented somewhat different factions and tendencies, the Whig
and Tory parties were narrowly confined to the privileged classes. Elections meant
real choice among separate, contending parties and personalities.
Gagnon foregrounded and asserted “they [the Whig and Tory parties]
nonetheless represented different factions and tendencies” by making it the
main clause and, thereby, asserting it. He backgrounded the information that
they were narrowly confined to the privileged classes. My version did the
reverse. I made “the Whig and Tory parties were narrowly confined to the
privileged classes” the main clause and, thereby, asserted it. I made “they
represented different factions” the subordinate clause and, thereby,
backgrounded it and took it as assumed information.
Note that my version makes Gagnon final sentence (“Elections meant real
choice ...”) sound odd, since asserting the two parties were narrowly confined
to the same class of people mitigates any claim that choosing between them in
an election was much of a “real choice.”
Of course, just because we have asserted something or asked a question via
the use of a main clause does not alone make it of great significance. It simply 
 100 Building Things in the World
makes it the main speech action we are engaged in and the information on
which we are currently focusing, which is, indeed, a type of significance. I can
add other things to my assertions and questions to render what I am asserting
or questioning yet more significant (or less), as in:
1. It is important that the Whig and Tory parties represented different
factions.
2. The Whig and Tory parties did indeed represent different factions.
3. The Whig and Tory parties crucially represented different factions.
4. The Whig and Tory parties barely represented different factions.
Examples 1–3 increase the significance of the information that the Whig and
Tory parties represented different factions. Example 4 downplays or mitigates
that significance. Of course, one way to decrease its significance is to remove
it from the main clause and make it a subordinate clause.
I can even increase the significance of information in a subordinate clause,
as in “While it is, indeed, important that the Whig and Tory parties were
narrowly confined to the privileged classes, nonetheless they represented
different factions.” Though I have here increased the significance of the
information in the subordinate clause, that clause is still not asserted, but
assumed and taken as background.
There are times when people assert or ask questions about information that
seems trivial. For example, a neighbor might say in passing, “It’s a nice day”
or “Nice day, isn’t it?.” Commenting on the weather seems trivial, so listeners
reason this way: My neighbor has asserted (questioned) something that seems
trivial and taken for granted, thus, making it foregrounded and significant.
Since this information is not important, the neighbor must mean something
else and be taking something else as significant. What he must be trying to do
is to be cordial to me as his neighbor, either to be nice, to be polite, or to keep
peace in the neighborhood. This is “phatic” communication, in which the
purpose is largely just to keep the peace, so to speak, and keep a channel of
social interaction open.
It is the fact that the neighbor has asserted (or questioned) something trivial,
which we usually do not do, that makes us as listeners reflect on what may be
his real purpose. Of course, by now, for most of us this sort of “weather talk” or
“small talk” is taken for granted and operates pretty much automatically.
3.5 Working with the Significance Building Tool
We use lots of grammatical devices to build or lessen significance, beyond
what we choose to put in a main clause and what we choose to put in a
subordinate clause, though it is always important to consider this. Below I
give some data that will allow you to reflect on and use the Significance
Building Tool.
Building Things in the World 101
Problem 19
The exchange below is from a meeting of a team of college students who are
learning to be engineers. They are part of a project from five colleges across
the country that together are supposed to build and design a model race car
that will be raced in a competition with the cars from other multi-school
teams. Two of the colleges are in the same state and in the transcript below
students from these two schools are meeting. Alex is from a very prestigious
engineering program at a very prestigious university. Katherine is from a
much less prestigious program from a much less prestigious university.
The data below is from the research of Kevin O’Connor at the University of
Rochester (not yet published). The marks in the transcript below mean the
following:
“:” means a sound was lengthened
“/” is a non-final intonation contour
“?” is a final rising intonation contour
“//” is a final falling intonation contour
“(.)” marks a short pause
“(inaud”) means a portion of the speech was inaudible on the tape
Brackets mean the two speaker said the two things marked in brackets at the same
time
Alex: And just to: sort of update the (inaud) right here uh /
 I had a question on what the objective is /
 Of this uh sort of uh sort of fi- five school team?
 Was it to actually produce a working model /
 Or was it to design somethin?
 Because if it is to design somethin /
 Then uh we have to dedicate more time towards uh (.) designing //
 Rather than uh (.) building //
 [Wuh- wuh- what (inaud-)
Kath: [It’s to produce the car //
Alex: It’s actually to produce a car?
Kath: Yes.
Questions:
1. What does Alex do that gives significance to designing and indicates that
he considers designing more important or significant an engineering
activity than building?
2. What does Alex do that downplays the significance of the five school
consortium?
3. How does Katherine make producing the car important? Do you think
her bluntness and conciseness plays a role in this?
 102 Building Things in the World
4. It turns out that the students from Alex’s (prestigious) engineering
program (where many of the students come from professional families)
take design rather than actually building to be the more important aspect
of engineering. Alex’s program was primarily responsible for designing in
this project. On the other hand, the students from Katherine’s (less
prestigious) engineering program (where many of the students come
from working class families) take building to be as important (or more so)
than designing. In this project, Katherine’s program was primarily
responsible for building what was designed. Does this contrast surprise
you? If not, why not? How does it bear on what Alex and Katherine see as
significant?
5. Why do you think Alex hesitates (“uh”) and pauses (“(.)”) before both
“designing” and “building” near the end of his turn at talk?
Problem 20
Below I reprint a small portion of a letter from a department chair to a
university tenure committee. Several members of the committee had voted
against the tenure of a person from this chairman’s department because they
questioned the ethics of some of his research:
I wish to convey deep concern over the validity of the committee’s actions. I don’t
believe that it is up to your committee to assess the ethics of someone’s research.
This university has in place rigorous procedures for assessing this issue.
Questions:
1. How does the writer build significance in each sentence and what is he
making significant? Include word choice and phrasing choices in your
answer.
2. The chairman obviously did not care to mitigate his objections. Perhaps
being this blunt might offend some members of the committee. In this case,
the candidate won a majority of the committee’s votes and only a minority
voted no on ethical grounds. But let’s say a majority had voted no on ethical
grounds and the chairman’s letter needed to convince the committee to
reconsider their vote. Now such bluntness might not work so well. Can you
rewrite this portion of the letter in way that might be more conducive to
getting the committee to reconsider its vote? How does significance building
work in your version and compare to the chairman’s?
3.6 The Activities Building Tool
One thing we build with language, as we saw in earlier sections, are actions.
We do things with language like promising and encouraging. But action goes 
Building Things in the World 103
further than this. We also use language to build what I will call “activities,”
using the word in a special limited sense. Activities are just another way to
look at actions. When I call something an action, I am focusing on doing and
what is being done. When I call something an activity I am focusing on how
an action or sequences of actions carries out a socially recognizable and
institutionally or culturally normed endeavor. Often the word “practice” is
used for what I am calling an activity.
Let me give some examples of the contrast I am trying to make in
distinguishing between actions and activities. If I say someone is “playing a
video game,” I am naming an action. If I say they are “gaming,” I am naming
an activity or practice, which names a way of engaging in various actions so as
to be socially recognized by others as a “gamer.”
If I say a parent is “reading a book to her child,” I am naming an action.
However, there are established ways that some parents read and interact with
their small children to get them ready for school and advantaged (ahead)
when they go to school. They read with lots of expression, ask the child
questions, encourage the child to comment on the text, respond to the child’s
remarks, ask the child what a given word “says” or picture means, and other
such things. This activity or practice does not have a set name, though some
people just call it “book reading” or “reading with your child.” In any case,
many parents recognize this activity as an established routine that gets kids
ready for school.
Not all parents, however, read this way to their small children. Some read
and tell the child to sit quietly and not interrupt. This is an activity or practice
that is not as good for getting kids ready for and ahead in school.
These two different ways of reading to a child or to engage in book reading
with a child are partially class and culturally based. Working class parents and
parents from cultures which value authoritarian parenting tend to adopt the
latter form where the child listens quietly. The other more interactional form
is carried out more often by middle class parents and parents from cultures
which value less authoritarian forms of parenting. The interactional form is
also adopted at school by many kindergarten teachers and is supported by
schools as a way to get children ready for learning to read.
If I say John is “playing baseball at the park” I am naming an action. If I say
“John plays baseball for the Yankees” I am naming an activity, professional
sports. If I say “Mary is writing on her computer” I am naming an action. If I
say “Mary is writing a review of a novel for the school newspaper” I am naming
an activity or practice. If I say, “Professor Smith is talking to the students” I
am naming an action. If I say “Professor Smith is lecturing to the students,” I
am naming an activity or practice.
The distinction between actions and activities is not air tight. It is really
about whether we are concentrating on doing in the here and now (actions)
or the meaning, the social significance, and the social, institutional, or cultural
norms being followed (activity). When we look at something as an action we 
 104 Building Things in the World
are focused on what is being done; when we look at something as an activity
or practice, we are focused on its social, institutional, and cultural significance.
Activities usually involve a set of actions and ways of sequencing or combining
them that are normed by a given institution, culture, or some socially
recognizable group (e.g., video “gamers,” i.e., people who “game”).
Of course, all actions are also socially and culturally normed in the sense
that social groups and cultures have norms and standards about how actions
should be done. But activities (practices) are larger sociocultural endeavors
and when we focus our attention on them we are also focusing particularly on
institutional, social, and cultural support systems and values.
So we can now state our second building tool:
Tool #15: The Activities Building Tool
For any communication, ask what activity (practice) or activities (practices)
this communication is building or enacting. What activity or activities is this
communication seeking to get others to recognize as being accomplished?
Ask also what social groups, institutions, or cultures support and norm (set
norms for) whatever activities are being built or enacted. [The Doing and
Not Saying Tool in Section 2.1 deals with actions; this tool deals with
activities/practices.]
Note that activities like (video) gaming or “book reading” (say of the middleclass interactive sort) have to be built, enacted, or produced anew each time
someone wants to accomplish them. At the same time, when they are built,
enacted, or produced they are done in more or less similar ways as they have
been so before, by ourselves and others, otherwise people would not know
(recognize) what was being done. It is, however, always worth asking of any
activity (practice) being built, enacted, or produced just how similar a given
performance is to the “normal” way this activity is carried out. If there are
significant differences, then the current performance is potentially a source of
disruption or innovation in social life.
Let me turn now to some data. The data below is from the same meeting
that Karen’s data in Section 1.3 is from. The meeting, as we said before, was
composed of an historian from Woodson University, a representative of an
educational research center at the university, several teachers, students, and
one school administrator. The goal of the project was to help middle-school
teachers engage their students with doing history, especially studying the
local history of their own neighborhoods.
As is typical of such meetings, the person chairing the meeting, the
representative of the educational research center in this case, asked the people
in the meeting to take turns introducing themselves. An introduction to a
group in a formal meeting is an activity or practice. 
Building Things in the World 105
Part of the job of discourse analysis is to analyze the structure or patterning
of activities. We also need always to ask how routinized or rigid an activity is.
Some activities are carried out in very similar ways each time they are done.
Little variation is allowed. These activities are highly routinized. Other
activities allow more variation (but are still recognized as the “same” or similar
sorts of activities).
Introductions at formal meetings are particularly rigid or routine in how
they are carried out. While any activity has to bear some similarity to the
same sorts of activities that have been carried out before (or people would
not know what is going on), not all activities are as rigid and routine as
formal introductions in such meetings as this one. For example, much more
variation is allowed in how people carry out an activity like giving a report
at such a meeting, though, of course, there are norms to follow for reports,
as well.
We also want to ask, no matter how routinized an activity is or is not,
what sorts of other communications and actions—what sorts of social
work—people can and do carry out while still respecting the structure of the
main activity in which they are engaged. For example, when we analyze the
data below we will see that even though people follow the pattern for an
introduction quite faithfully and closely, they still manage to engage in
communicating and acting out their own agenda. Even though they are
heavily constrained by the rather rigid pattern of introductions, they still
manage to communicate and act creatively in their own right.
The Activities Building Tool tells us to look at how various actions are
carried out as people build, often together, various activities. Some of these
actions are integral to building the activity. Others are ones people engage in
inside the activity to carry out their own goals and agendas. These actions are
often, as we will see, carrying out others of our seven building tasks.
Even in the type of introduction we will study below, rigid in its demands
though it is, there is still some variation to how it is done, variation across
people and settings. Nonetheless, everyone in this meeting (14 people) used
the very same pattern with which to introduce themselves. Each person first
stated their name. Next they said what role they held that was relevant to why
they were invited to the meeting. Next they gave a rationale for why they were
at the meeting. And finally there was a coda where they “signed off.” It is just
such patterning or structure we are seeking when we analyze the activities
people are building or constructing. Of course, as we said, this patterning or
structure is not always so straightforward and regular.
Below I print the introductions of the two undergraduate students in the
meeting. Both Melissa and Sandy were students in the history professor’s (Sara
Vogel) course at the university. Because they were Sara’s students, they were
recruited by the representative from the university research center (Ariel
Dante) to help on the project. Melissa was a White student. Sandy was an
African-American student.
 106 Building Things in the World
Both Melissa and Sandy were going to work for both Ariel and Sara, the two
women who headed the project, though ultimately Sara was the lead person,
since the project was her idea and she had asked the research center for their
help. There is one crucial piece of context you need to know, however.
Sara, the history professor, was teaching a course on Black History. The
course was concentrating on local Black History (in Middleview), in part
because the project we are discussing was going to be devoted to local history
and students in the course would have the opportunity to work on the project.
This was the course both Melissa and Sandy were in. Most of the AfricanAmerican students on campus had chosen to boycott the course, because Sara
was White. Sandy, an African-American, had chosen not to boycott the course.
She had not only joined the course, but the project as well.
So here is the data:
Melissa’s Introduction:
Name: 1. My name is Melissa Smith //
Role: 2. I’m a student at Woodson University //
Rationale: 3. And I’m working directly with Ariel /
 And the Literacy Center on this project //
 4. And I’m also working with Sara /
 In a seminar around something about history /
 In Black Middleview //
Coda: 5. So that’s about it for me
Sandy’s Introduction:
Name: 1. My name is Sandy Wilson //
Role: 2. I’m a Woodson student also //
Rationale: 3. I’m working directly with Ariel Dante and Prof. Vogel on the
same things that Melissa—[stops, pauses, then continues]
 4. We’re in the same class as I am, this project also //
Coda: 5. That’s about it for me I think //
It is clear that such introductions, as an activity, are pretty constrained. They
follow a pretty rigid pattern and the speaker is not supposed to hold the floor
for too long (though we have all known people who did). Despite the form’s
rigidity, speakers can still get significant social work done.
Melissa splits the rationale in her introduction into two parts. In the first
part she says she is “working directly with Ariel” (the representative of the
research institute) “on this project.” In the second part of her rationale, she
says: “and I’m also working with Sara /in a seminar around something about
history /in Black Middleview //.”
Despite the fact that Sara is the true head of the project, Melissa only states
her relationship to Sara through Sara’s (contested) course, not the project
itself. She could well have said she was working “directly” on the project with
both Ariel and Sara (after all, Ariel was there to facilitate Sara’s work with the
teachers and schools).
Building Things in the World 107
When Melissa says “in a seminar around something about history / in Black
Middleview” this is both distancing (from Sara) and somewhat impolite. It is
somewhat insulting for a student in a professor’s course to say the course is
about “something about history” and then, almost as an afterthought (in a
separate intonational unit), say “in Black Middleview,” when the course was
entirely about Black history with a focus on Middleview. It sounds as if Melissa
does not really know what the class is about or, worse, that Sara has not made
it clear. However, the content of the course had been the subject of much
controversy on the campus—and people very well knew what its content
was—and Melissa was well aware of this.
Melissa, perhaps due to the controversy, is distancing herself from Sara and
her course and connecting herself more “directly” to Ariel. This is a good
example of how people can engage in more than one building task at once. In
constructing her introduction (an activity), Melissa is also building connections
and disconnections, in this case her connections and disconnections to people
on the project (Ariel and Sara), as well as to the project and the course. She is
also, of course, building and mitigating social relationships she has with Ariel
and Sara in the project.
Melissa’s introduction puts Sandy in a hard place. Sandy is loyal to Sara and
has stood up for her in the face of the controversy. She is African-American
and Melissa is White, and, since it is the African-Americans who are boycotting
the course, she is more directly involved with the controversy. Yet she has
remained loyal to Sara. However, formal introductions as a form do not allow
speakers to explicitly undo what previous speakers have said in their
introductions or to directly confront them. Of course, a speaker could do this,
but it would be perceived as confrontational and a violation of the norms of
such introductions.
Worse, it is common in introductions that subsequent speakers follow,
even imitate, the format of the previous speaker, as Sandy tries to do here.
And this is all the more likely here, given that Melissa and Sandy are in
almost exactly the same positions in the project and in their relationships to
Ariel and Sara.
Sandy says: “I’m working directly with Ariel Dante and Prof. Vogel on the
same things that Melissa.” She imitates Melissa’s “directly,” but connects
herself “directly” to both Ariel and Sara. Furthermore, she uses their full
names, treating them as higher in status than her (they are older and leaders
in the project), something Melissa did not do. Thus, both her connections and
relationships building are done differently than Melissa’s.
However, when Sandy says “on the same things that Melissa …,” she stops,
unfinished. She has the same relationship to Ariel and Sara on the project as
does Melissa in a formal sense of their duties, but she is loyal to Sara and not
just Ariel. She and Melissa are not the same in that respect and Sandy does not
want to replicate Melissa’s disconnection from Sara. 
 108 Building Things in the World
At the same time, she does not want to confront Melissa directly and correct
her. So she says “we’re in the same class as I am, this project also .” She is
flummoxed by how Melissa has set up her (Sandy’s) turn at introducing
herself and so this comes out wrong. But she clearly wants to connect the class
and project and say that both she and Melissa are, in actuality, in both of them
together and that they are, in fact, connected. However, saying this explicitly
would have been confrontational with her fellow undergraduate in front of
many people she did not know.
Melissa has deftly built her introduction to follow the rather rigid format
this activity or practice requires, while still engaging in social work, in this
case, the work of building a connection to Ariel and a disconnection to Sandy,
as well as building her social relationship with them in very different directions.
In the process, Melissa has made Sandy’s introduction much harder, as
Sandy tries to follow Melissa’s introduction pattern. This requires Sandy to do
things in a similar way to how Melissa has done them, while not replicating
Melissa’s distancing from, and even impoliteness towards, Sara, all the while
not explicitly responding to and contradicting Melissa. In a sense, her “speech
errors” actually help this to happen.
We have used this data to show how Melissa built (enacted) an activity,
namely doing a formal introduction at a meeting. The building requirements
here are fairly narrow and strict, things have to pretty much be done in one
way: Name, Role, Rationale, Coda, all done in short compass. Nonetheless,
Melissa communicates and acts out her desires about connections and
disconnections and social relationships. At the same time, she situates Sandy
in a difficult position: Sandy has to follow the introduction pattern, even
imitate Melissa, yet not confront Melissa directly, and still not disconnect
from Sara the way Melissa did. This, too, Sandy manages to pull off, speech
errors and all.
Introductions look harmless. But all social activities (practices) are rife with
opportunities for people to engage in social work, all the while “hiding”
behind the activity and its rules. People rarely disrupt activities in which they
are engaged jointly to confront others since that would “break” the activity.
One thing this data is meant to make clear is that even activities we take for
granted as “trivial” or routine can be important, hiding a good deal of
important social work.
3.7 Working with the Activities Building Tool
The Activities Building Tool tells us to ask how people are building a socially
recognizable activity, what actions this takes, and what actions they manage
to accomplish within the activity that realize their own goals and agendas.
People can be building more than one activity at a time. We discourse analysts
always want to ask, as well, how rigid (routine) or not the activity we are
studying is (How much freedom are people normally allowed in how they 
Building Things in the World 109
carry out the activity?) and how much innovation, if any, is occurring in how
the activity is being carried out.
Problem 21
Below is printed a dialogue. What activity are these people engaged in? You
may have to do some research (ask around) to find out what sort of activity
this is. How does the ways in which these people use language reflect and help
build this activity? What actions are Bead and Allele carrying out inside this
activity? This data is good data with which to work with the Making Strange
Tool. What is strange about this communication? How did it ever come to
seem to normal and natural to some people?
Bead: Are you really dead
Allele: Yes, did you get the heart?
Bead: I got the heart—another guy was helping
Allele: Good
Bead: I am standing over your body—mourning
Allele: I died for you
Bead: So touching
Allele: It’s a long way back
Bead: I know—I’ve done it
Does knowing that Allele and Bead are brothers, identical twins in fact, help
you in any way better understand the data?
Problem 22
Below is reprinted a warning on a bottle of aspirin I once had. Answer the
questions below.
Warnings: Children and teenagers should not use this medication for chicken pox or
flu symptoms before a doctor is consulted about Reye Syndrome, a rare but serious
illness reported to be associated with aspirin. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach
of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact
a poison control center immediately. As with any drug, if you are pregnant or
nursing a baby, seek the advice of a health professional before using this product.
IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT NOT TO USE ASPIRIN DURING THE LAST 3
MONTHS OF PREGNANCY UNLESS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED TO DO SO BY
A DOCTOR BECAUSE IT MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS IN THE UNBORN CHILD
OR COMPLICATIONS DURING DELIVERY. 
 110 Building Things in the World
Questions:
1. What activity or activities is this language seeking to build or construct?
Is the only activity here an official (legal) warning?
2. Why doesn’t the sentence “In case of accidental overdose, seek professional
assistance or contact a poison control center immediately?” leave out the
word “accidental”? Why is the word there? Is the label telling us to let
people die who take an overdose on purpose?
3. Why does the first sentence mention this medication (the medication in
the bottle) directly (“this medication”), but the second sentence says “this
and all drugs” and the last says “as with any drug”? Why is the label
sometimes direct about the actual medication in the bottle and sometimes
generic and talking about “all drugs” and “any drug”? Why does the first
sentence use the phrase “this medication,” rather than “aspirin” (after all
it uses “aspirin” at the end of the sentence)?
4. The first sentence (in italics on the label) and the last (in capitals on the
label) were added later. Originally the warning had only the sentences in
the middle (in regular print). Why do you think these additions were
added? The style of language in these additions is different than the style
of language in the middle sentences. How so? Why?
5. People often say that warnings on medicine are meant to protect people
and, thus, should be written in a simple way so that people with poor
reading levels can read them. Is this “warning” written in a way that
people with poor reading levels could read it? Do people usually read
these warnings? Why are they so often in small print? Who is the primary
audience for this “warning”? Who is the “author” of this “warning”?
Problem 23
The data below involves a second grade teacher teaching reading. The teacher
is working with a small group of students. She first dictates a sentence that the
students have to write down. The sentence was “I love the puppy.” Then she
dictates a list of words, one at a time, which the children are to write down
with correct spelling. After they have gone through the list, the teacher asks
the children how the word “love” in the sentence is spelled and how each
word on the list (one after the other) is spelled. The children are supposed to
correct each spelling, if they have made a mistake, after the teacher has elicited
the correct spelling orally from the children.
Below is what one African-American girl’s list looked like. Note that “sume”
(“some”) and “shuve” (“shove”) are spelled incorrectly:
Building Things in the World 111
 dove
 sume
 glove
 one
 shuve
 come
 none
As we said, the teacher has the children correct the original sentence and then
each word in the list one-by-one, eliciting the correct spelling of each item
from the group of as a whole. When she gets to “some,” the second word on
the list, the African-American girl corrects it, then notices what the pattern is
and goes ahead and corrects “shuve” further down the list. The teacher stops
her and sharply reprimands her, saying that they have to go “one at a time”
and she shouldn’t “go ahead.”
The teacher moves on to have the small group of children engage in a “picture
walk” of a book. This is an activity where children “read the pictures” in a book,
using each picture in turn to predict what the text in the book will say. The
African-American girl bounces in her chair repeatedly, enthusiastically
volunteering for each picture. The teacher tells her to calm down. The girl says,
“I’m sorry, but I’m SO happy?.” The teacher responds, “Well, just calm down.”
Questions:
1. What activity is the teacher building in the spelling task? What is the
nature of this activity? What are her goals in this activity? Is there more
than one activity she is building?
2. Is there any way that the teacher’s response to the girl’s “going ahead” in
correcting the spelling on her list could seem to contradict what could be
seen as a key goal of this lesson (i.e., recognizing a spelling pattern in
English)? Why would she contradict this goal?
3. What does the teacher’s response to the girl’s, “I’m sorry, but I’m so
happy” (namely, “Well, just calm down”) and her response to this girl in
the spelling task tell you about how she views what she is doing when she
engages in the activity of teaching reading?
4. A well-known British sociologist of education, Basil Bernstein, said that in
every classroom there is a regulatory discourse and an instructional
discourse and often the instructional discourse is in the service of the
regulatory discourse. Do you have any idea what he meant by this? Does
the data about this teacher and child bear on this remark?

3.8 The Identities Building Tool
We use language to get recognized as taking on a certain identity or role. We
build an identity here and now as we speak. We each act out different identities
in our lives in different contexts. For example, a person might, at one and the
same time or at different times, be acting as a parent, a male, an AfricanAmerican, a professor, an avid video gamer, an evangelical Christian, a
committee chairman, and other such identities. And, too, each of these
identities can influence the others when any one of them is being performed.
We are all members of different cultures, social groups, and institutions and
have different sorts of roles and relationships. In each of these, we have to talk
and act so as to get recognized as having the “right”—or an “appropriate”—
identity. Evangelical Christians or gamers will not recognize just anyone as a
fellow Evangelical or gamer. They expect those they see as sharing their
identities to talk and act in certain ways. The same goes for bird watchers,
gang members, lawyers, and feminists.
Further, there are different types of Evangelical Christians, AfricanAmericans, gamers, feminists, lawyers, or any other identity. When we act and
speak as a particular “type of person,” that is, in a particular socially
recognizable identity, we act and speak specific types of these. There are
multiple ways of being an African-American, a gamer, an executive, a working
class person, or any other identity. Identities, as I am using the term, are about
being and recognizing different socially significant “types of people.”
Since we all have a number of different identities in different contexts, the
issue comes up as to whether there is some core identity or sense of self that
underlies and unifies all these multiple identities. Let’s call this our “core
identity.” Some scholars do not think any such core unified identity really
exists, though almost all humans feel they have one. They feel there is someone
they are that is behind or stands apart from all their social identities and roles.
Other scholars feel that we humans actively create our core identity by the
way we tell the stories of our lives—and what we have to say about who we
are—to others and to ourselves. And yet this story, and what we say about
who we are, can change in different contexts and across time. At the same
time, it is clear that our sense of having a body (and mind) that is ours and
that moves across all different sorts of contexts is part of our sense of having
a unified, core identity.
In any case, as discourse analysts, we do not care whether there is really a
core self or exactly what it is. We care about how people express their sense of
who they are and their multiple other identities through language.
Building Things in the World 113
There is one identity that we can all perform that is important to single out.
We are all capable of being an “everyday person,” not a specialist or expert of
any sort, in certain contexts. When we talk and act as everyday people, we all
talk and act differently depending on our own dialects and cultures, though
there are also certain shared norms about this across a wider society like the
United States. I will call this identity our “life world identity.” The life world
is all those contexts in which we speak and act as everyday people.
Even specialists like doctors, lawyers, physicists, and so forth, do not always
speak and act as specialists or experts. There are contexts where they are
expected to speak and act as everyday people, appealing to commonsense,
“what everybody knows,” and what everyday humans are expected to share.
Using highly specialist language over drinks to talk to friends or intimates
who are seeking to fraternize and socialize is usually considered rude.
Sometimes a group of people who all share the same specialty or expert
knowledge may talk “shop” as they socialize, but even in some of these cases
they do not.
Let me repeat, however, that people from different social classes and cultural
groups in a society use different sorts of language and act in different ways
when they are communicating as everyday people in their life worlds. They
even vary on what counts as “commonsense” (the sense of everyday people).
Furthermore, there is still variation across different contexts, in how any one
person talks and acts as an everyday person. We do not talk the same way at a
bar as we do to our spouses when we are being intimate as we do when we are
talking to people we do not know particularly well (e.g., at a bus stop). But in
each case, we normally talk and act as everyday people and consider all these
contexts life world contexts.
When people are speaking as everyday people they use what we will call a
“vernacular style” of language. People’s vernaculars differ by dialect and
sociocultural group. Further, we each have different versions of the
vernacular—for example, less and more formal versions—that we use in
different contexts.
In Section 3.2 you reflected on some data about a young woman talking to her
boyfriend and to her parents. This woman, who I will call “Jane,” was an upper
middle-class, Anglo-American in her twenties. Jane was attending one of my
courses on language and communication. The course was discussing the ways
in which people varied how they spoke in different contexts to express different
identities. Jane claimed that she herself did not do this. She said she was
consistent from context to context in how she spoke and who she was. In fact,
to do otherwise, she said, would be “hypocritical,” a failure to “be oneself.”
In order to support her claim that she did not switch her style of speaking
in different contexts and for different conversational partners, Jane decided to
record herself talking to her parents and to her boyfriend. In both cases, she
decided to discuss a story the class had discussed earlier, so as to be sure that,
in both contexts, she was talking about the same thing.
 114 Building Things in the World
In the story, a character named Abigail wants to get across a river to see her
true love, Gregory. A river boat captain (Roger) says he will take her only if
she consents to sleep with him. In desperation to see Gregory, Abigail agrees
to do so. But when she arrives and tells Gregory what she has done, he disowns
her and sends her away. There is more to the story, but this is enough for our
purposes here. Students in my class had been asked to rank order the characters
in the story from the most offensive to the least.
In explaining to her parents why she thought Gregory was the worst (least
moral) character in the story, the young woman said the following:
Well, when I thought about it, I don’t know, it seemed to me that Gregory should
be the most offensive. He showed no understanding for Abigail, when she told
him what she was forced to do. He was callous. He was hypocritical, in the sense
that he professed to love her, then acted like that.
Earlier, in her discussion with her boyfriend, in an informal setting, she had
also explained why she thought Gregory was the worst character. In this
context she said:
What an ass that guy was, you know, her boyfriend. I should hope, if I ever did
that to see you, you would shoot the guy. He uses her and he says he loves her.
Roger never lies, you know what I mean?
It was clear—clear even to Jane—that Jane had used two very different styles
of language. The differences between these two styles are everywhere apparent
in the two texts. To her parents, she carefully hedges her claims (“I don’t
know,” “it seemed to me”); to her boyfriend, she makes her claims straight
out. To her boyfriend, she uses terms like “ass” and “guy,” while to her parents
she uses more formal terms like “offensive,” “understanding,” “callous,”
“hypocritical” and “professed.” She also uses more formal sentence structure
to her parents (“it seemed to me that ...,” “He showed no understanding for
Abigail, when ...,” “He was hypocritical in the sense that ...”) than she does to
her boyfriend (... “that guy, you know, her boyfriend,” “Roger never lies, you
know what I mean?”).
Jane repeatedly addresses her boyfriend as “you,” thereby noting his social
involvement as a listener, but does not directly address her parents in this
way. In talking to her boyfriend, she leaves several points to be inferred, points
that she spells out more explicitly to her parents (e.g., her boyfriend must
infer that Gregory is being accused of being a hypocrite from the information
that though Roger is bad, at least he does not lie, which Gregory did in
claiming to love Abigail).
All in all, Jane appears to use more “school-like” language to her parents.
Her language to them requires less inferencing on their part and distances
them as listeners from social and emotional involvement with what she is 
Building Things in the World 115
saying, while stressing, perhaps, their cognitive involvement and their
judgment of her and her “intelligence.” Her language to her boyfriend stresses,
on the other hand, social and affective involvement, solidarity, and coparticipation in meaning making.
This young woman is making visible and recognizable two different versions
of who she is. She is enacting through talk two different identities. In one case
she is “a dutiful, intelligent, and educated daughter having dinner with her
proud parents” (who paid for her education) and in the other case she is “a
girlfriend being intimate with her boyfriend.” Of course, I should add, that
while people like Jane may talk at dinner this way to their parents, not all
people do. There are other identities one can take on for one’s parents. And,
indeed, Jane may very well speak differently to her parents in other contexts.
We will later call the different styles of language that Jane uses—and all
such stylistic variation—different “social languages” (see Section 4.4). In
her language to her boyfriend she uses an informal variety of her vernacular
social language. In her language to her parents, she moves to a quite formal
style of language that is “school-based.” This style of language serves for
many educated people as the most formal version of their vernacular, though
we could also say that when people speak this way they are not really being
everyday people, but “educated people.” People who do not use this style of
language, or at least not when engaged with family and friends, sometimes
think that people who do use it in such contexts are “putting on airs.” In any
case, it is one place where the vernacular transitions into something on the
border of being a “specialist” language (one associated with a good deal of
education).
One way we enact an identity in language is to portray other people and
their identities in certain ways that compare or contrast with the identity we
want to take on or enact. In many cases a given identity cannot exist without
other people taking up or being portrayed as having related identities. For
example, the “Special Ed” teacher needs “Special Ed” (“SPED”) students and
talks about and acts in regard to students in such a way as to create and sustain
this identity as well.
I have often heard teachers talk about “my low” and “my high” students. It
is, of course, not clear that we really can rank students on one single scale as
either high or low. Furthermore, there are those who argue that being “high”
or “low” as a student is not something that resides in the student or the
student’s mental abilities, but in the contexts in which their schooling takes
place and their relations to and within those contexts. On this view, a student
could be “high” in one setting or set of relationships and “low” in another.
Nonetheless, schools are often about ranking and sorting students and within
this Discourse (see Section 4.8) the teacher takes on an identity as a sorter and
the students take on—and sometimes are talked about by teachers in terms
of—an identity as things to be sorted based on the basis of their fixed internal
traits (e.g., being “smart” or “quick”).
 116 Building Things in the World
Jane above is not just enacting in language different identities for herself.
She is also creating different identities for her boyfriend and her parents. She
is “positioning” them in certain ways, that is, through her talk she is creating
an identity “position” or “place” for them to take up and to talk within, for
this time and place.
So we want to ask how people enact different identities, how they portray
other people’s identities, and how they position others to take up identities in
response to them. Thus, we can state our next building tool, the Identity
Building Tool:
Tool #16: The Identities Building Tool
For any communication, ask what socially recognizable identity or identities the
speaker is trying to enact or to get others to recognize. Ask also how the speaker’s
language treats other people’s identities, what sorts of identities the speaker
recognizes for others in relationship to his or her own. Ask, too, how the speaker is
positioning others, what identities the speaker is “inviting” them to take up.

3.9 Working with the Identities Building Tool
People use language to build different identities for themselves in different
contexts. They also help build identities for other people that they “invite”
them to take up. In turn, they often use the identities they are building for
others to further the work they are doing building their own identity (in
terms of comparison and/or contrast). Below I print two sets of data that will
allow you to study both how a speaker constructs an identity for herself and
uses identities she attributes to others to further the construction of her own
identity.
Problem 24
The data below is from an interview with a White middle-school girl named
Emily. Emily has fairly recently moved from a middle-class community to an
upper-middle-class prestigious suburb. In the data below Emily is talking
about her new best friend in the suburb, a White girl named Susie. Read and
reflect on the data and then answer the questions below.
Building Things in the World 117
In the transcript, “/” makes a non-final intonation contour, “//” and “?”
mark final contours. A comma represents a pause and “—” represents a place
where the speaker breaks off and says something else.
1. Like, there’s there was this girl / who was dressed / dressing really like like
preppy //
2. And, and, she came up to me and I was talking with Susie //
3. And she’s like, she’s like, “Yeah” you know / “I really like the Grateful
Dead //
4. I just got one of their albums and I like the song like KC Jones” //
5. Which is like, you know, the most popular song like in the world that the
Dead ever wrote //
6. And um, she’s like, “Yeah, they’re really like cool and I wanna get their
shirt and stuff”//
7. And so after she walked away / I was talking to Susie / And, and I was like
/ I was like, “Oh” //
8. And Susie’s like “So what do you think about” like, “that girl, that she
likes the Dead”?
9. I was like, “I think she’s kind of a poser”//
10. And um, and Susie’s like, “Well why do you say that? //
11. You know if she really likes the Dead what makes her a poser”?
12. So, I mean, it’s like she has a point //
13. But she doesn’t, like, even like—
14. And then I can’t explain myself //
15. I’m just like, “Well, it’s just how it is, you know,” I mean //
16. And like, a lot of times she’ll make comments that I take to be like, like,
like, homophobic or something //
17. Like not really badly, like, she won’t say that gay people are evil or
something //
18. But you know, just like, sort of like innuendoes //
19. And um, I’ll say like, “Oh Susie, you know, please don’t say that / like, it
bothers me” //
20. And, and she’ll like, “Why? It’s not bad / you know, like, I wasn’t saying
anything bad” //
[short aside between Emily and interviewer, then Emily continues about
Susie]
21. About people, like when I, when I was in Colorado / I came back and I
was telling her about um, like, we went on a horse trip //
22. And we stayed with these like cowboys / and like, they were so cool //
23. They were like, right out of the movies //
24. And, right near us there was this shed / and there were like, where we
were camping / which was 22 miles out of civilization t/ his little like run
down like cabin shed thing //
 118 Building Things in the World
25. And they told us all these ghost stories / about this guy who lived there /
like Alfred Packer / who was a cannibal //
26. And so when I came back / I told Susie these stories //
27. And she’s like, “Oh, they’re just making that up to scare you //
28. They don’t believe that and stuff / because, like, it’s not true” //
29. And, you know, I said, “Maybe it’s not true but they do believe it / because
you know that’s like, how they’ve been brought up //
30. And they like really are rednecks / and they like really say these things” //
31. And she’s like, “No:o they aren’t really like that / no, they’re just saying
that, they like—”
32. And I’m like, “Susie, you, you just don’t understand that there are people
like that”//
33. And so, I dunno //
34. She, she’s, like doesn’t understand some things //
35. But she, she’s like really nice and really fun / and that’s why we’re friends //
36. So //
Questions:
1. What sort of identity is Emily building for herself? What sort of identity
is she building for Susie? Go through the data and point to all the ways
Emily is using language to build these identities. Tie all your observations
to specific features of the language in the data.
2. What role does the identity Emily is building for Susie play in Emily’s
own identity building? That is, how does the identity that Emily attributes
to Susie help build the identity she is attempting to construct for herself
in this data?
3. In another part of the interview, Emily tells the interviewer that she
considers the kids in her new town “sheltered” (by their parents) and not
“worldly.” She considers herself more “worldly” because in her old
community she saw more diversity and was “less sheltered.” How does
the data above reflect these viewpoints Emily holds about her identity and
that of the kids in her new town?
4. Do you see any tensions or contradictions in how Emily attempts to build
her own identity both through talk about herself and through juxtaposing
her identity to the one she attributes to Susie?
Problem 25
The data below is from an interview with a middle school Latina named Maria.
Maria goes to school in a blue-collar industrial town that has lost a good deal of
its industry and is in a poor economic condition. There are not a lot of jobs and
those that still do exist often no longer carry good wages and medical benefits.
Many of the parents in the town—(non-Hispanic), Black, or Hispanic—work 
Building Things in the World 119
more than one job to make ends meet and there is high unemployment. There
are not a lot of wealthy people in the town. There are many working class and
poor whites in the town and in the lower tracks at school, as well as Blacks and
Hispanics. However, the small upper track in Maria’s school is almost all white.
At this point in the interview, Maria is talking about why there are so few
professional Hispanics (e.g., doctors) compared to whites:
1. Because like white people get more education //
2. Like Hispanic people don’t, don’t / some of the Hispanic don’t like go to
college and stuff like that //
3. And, you know, just, the white people just like / they like to, they want a
future //
4. You know they—
5. Some, some Hispanic and stuff they, they just—
6. I’m Hispanic but I’m saying—
7. Some um, they just like, like to hang around / they don’t want to go to
school / they don’t you know //
8. So people don’t, don’t think like that //
9. They want to get an education / they want to have a good/ their life //
10. And they really don’t care what people say / like if they make fun of em //
11. Like “gringos” and stuff like that //
12. They don’t, they don’t care / they just do their work and then, they see
after / they’re like, they’re married /and they have their professions and
stuff made, / then, let’s see who’s gonna like, be better //
13. Maybe the Hispanic boy that said that you gonna / that like you’re a nerd
or something //
14. Probably in the streets looking for sh, for money and stuff like that / sick
/ and you have a house / you have your profession / you got money //
15. So—
Questions:
1. What sort of identity is Maria building for herself, Hispanics, and whites?
2. Earlier in the interview Maria has said she thinks s are smarter than
Hispanics. She goes on to say:
They’re just smart // ((slight laugh))
I think they were born smart //
There’s something like, their moms or something they give em a little piece of
smart or something // ((slight laugh))
so they’ll be smart //
How does what Maria says here fit with the way she treats identity in the
data above?
 120 Building Things in the World
3. What tensions or contradictions are present in the ways in which Maria is
building identities for herself, Hispanics, and whites?
4. Maria talks little here directly about herself. How does this affect the
identity or sense of self we as listeners attribute to her? What is the role
of “I’m Hispanic but I’m saying—”?
5. The interviewer was a woman. Do you think this played a role in what
Maria said? Why or why not?
6. Do you think the state of Maria’s town plays a role in how she looks at
identity here?
7. People often tend to blame social problems (like declining economic
fortunes of a town in the global world) on other people and what they can
see and not on larger global and institutional factors. How does this play
a role in Maria’s talk?
8. People get themes they use in building identities from somewhere. They
usually don’t just make them up on the spot. Where do you think Maria
got some of her themes?
3.10 The Relationships Building Tool
We use language to build and sustain relationships of all different kinds. We
use language to build relationships with other people and with groups and
institutions. Clearly this building task is related to the Identities Building task,
since the identity we construct for ourselves in any context is often defined, in
part, by how we see and construe our relationships with other people, social
groups, cultures, or institutions.
In turn, we relate to other people in terms of different identities we take
them to have. I will talk and act towards someone differently if I see my
relationship to them as one of being a professional colleague as against being
a friend. I will even treat one and the same person differently when I relate to
them as a professional colleague and when I relate to them as a friend.
Consider again the data we looked at in Section 3.8 when we were discussing
the Identity Building Tool. There we looked at a young woman talking to her
parents, in one case, and to her boyfriend, in the other case. I reprint the two
communications below:
To Parents:
Well, when I thought about it, I don’t know, it seemed to me that Gregory should
be the most offensive. He showed no understanding for Abigail, when she told
him what she was forced to do. He was callous. He was hypocritical, in the sense
that he professed to love her, then acted like that.
To Boyfriend:
What an ass that guy was, you know, her boyfriend. I should hope, if I ever did
that to see you, you would shoot the guy. He uses her and he says he loves her.
Roger never lies, you know what I mean?
Building Things in the World 121
In Section 3.8 we said that this young woman is making visible and recognizable
two different versions of who she is. She is enacting through talk two different
identities. In one case she is “a dutiful, intelligent, and educated daughter
having dinner with her proud parents” and in the other case she is “a girlfriend
being intimate with her boyfriend.” But, of course, these are two different
sorts of relationships, as well. Jane is engaging in a relationship of solidarity
and bonding with her boyfriend. She is engaging in a relationship of more
formal deference and respect with her parents.
Identity and relationships go hand in hand. However, it is often useful to
focus on them separately. Creating or taking on identity and creating and
sustaining a relationship of a certain type are not the same, however closely
related they are. Identities set up parameters for a relationship. As a professor
(an identity) I can have different sorts of relationships with different sorts and
types of students, though there are constraints I cannot breach without
mitigating or destroying my identity as a professor. Furthermore, even though
I am a professor I have had different sorts of relationships with the college and
universities wherein I have been a professor.
Being a friend is a type of identity: it is a role to enact, a way of being a
certain type of person. Nonetheless, I can form different sorts of relationships
with different friends; for example, kidding and playful with one and more
deferential and polite with another. Here, too, there are parameters beyond
which I cannot go without mitigating or destroying my identity as a friend.
So, we always want to ask about both identity and relationships and how
they interact. Thus, we can state another building tool:
Tool #17: The Relationships Building Tool
For any communication, ask how words and various grammatical devices are
being used to build and sustain or change relationships of various sorts among
the speaker, other people, social groups, cultures, and/or institutions.
Let’s look at an example. In Section 3.2 we discussed a foreign doctoral student
in graduate school in the United States who, after several years in the program,
had lost her PhD advisor. She needed to get another one. She was talking to a
professor who she wanted as an advisor, but who was reluctant to take her on
as a student. She said: “It’s your job to help me, I need to learn.”
This student is construing the professor as being in what we might call a
“helping profession”: “It’s your job to help me.” We think of people in helping
professions as obligated to help people who need help if their need falls into
the domain of the professional’s skills. Thus, we think that priests, doctors,
nurses, and teachers are there to help people and are professionally and
morally obligated to help people in need. Of course, not all people in these
professions actually behave this way. There are doctors who will not treat 
 122 Building Things in the World
people who cannot pay no matter how dire their need. But, at least, ideally we
think of these professions as “helping professions.”
By construing the faculty member as a member of a helping profession, the
student is, of course, construing his relationship with the institution for which
he works in a certain way. She is construing the university as the sort of
institution that is there is to help people and pays its faculty to do so. That is
why it is “his job.” He is in a “helping profession,” she believes.
By saying “I need help” the student is stating her need for help, a need that
is supposed to necessitate that people in helping professions respond. She is
construing her relationship to the faculty member as a needy person who will
be helped by the professor in the way in which health professionals help sick
people or elementary school teachers help children in need of extra aid.
When one construes the relationships between graduate student and
professor in this way what is liable to happen if the professor says no? The
student is liable to make herself yet more needy, to construe herself as worse
off, so as to get the “helper” to help. This is what a sick patient might do if he
or she did not get enough of a response or a quick enough response from a
nurse. And this is, indeed, what the student did when the faculty member
continued to resist her request to be her new advisor.
The faculty member did not view his relationship to his institution or to his
students as one that was like a “helping profession.” He saw himself as mentoring
professionals who were already confident and skilled, much as a professional
sports coach views his or her players. Thus, expressing need was not going to
work. He expected an expression of confidence and skills, even if more skill
building was still needed. Yet more neediness was going to work even worse.
This encounter did not work out well for the student (at least initially).
Nonetheless, she can be seen as trying to get the faculty member to accept the
sort of relationship she was seeking to build. This could have happened, of
course. She might have gotten the faculty member to see his relationships
with his institution and students in a new way. All building is a risk. It may
not work. We can build buildings people refuse to live in.
At the same time this student could have tried to build relationships differently.
She could have used language to seek a relationship with the faculty member that
was, say, closer to the sort of relationship a coach has with a professional sports
team than the one a caring nurse has with her patients. In this case, she would
have had to have crafted herself as less needy and more confident, accomplished,
and competent, inviting the professor to see the relationship as mutually beneficial.
3.11 Working with the Relationships Building Tool
Problem 26
Consider again the data below, which we also saw in Section 1.6. This is data
from the history project we have discussed several times (e.g., see Section 1.4). 
Building Things in the World 123
Here a teacher named Jane (a good friend of Karen’s—who we saw in Section
1.4—Jane and Karen teach at the same school) is telling the historian Sara, and
the representatives of the university research center helping with the project,
about how the teachers are the ones who need to be contacted first if you want
to involve the children in their classes in a project. It is not acceptable to go to
an administrator first and not the teacher, as Sara has now twice done.
Jane is here talking in a context where Sara has written a grant proposal to
continue the project in the next year and has, once again, gone to Mary
Washington, an administrator, first and not the teachers. Joe is an administrator
(and Su and Lucy are teachers at his school) who was also at the first meeting,
the one from which the data from Karen in Section 1.4 above comes. Mary is,
of course, Mary Washington, the same administrator who Sara called and who
told Karen to call Sara:
Well I think /
one thing you need to recognize /
about the STRUCTURE of the Middleview schools
is that if Su, Lucy, Karen, and I /
or any combination thereof /
are involving our classrooms /
we are the people who need to be asked /
and to be plugged into it //
Joe does /
um as curriculum coordinator for Freeland Street /
does not have the right to commit Su Wilson //
Nor Linda Defoe //
Nor does Mary /
have the right to commit /
or structure the grant for us //
Uh it becomes a question /
like Karen said /
this isn’t her priority area / [Because Karen teaches English, not History like Jane]
that she wants to be in //
If it is mine /
or someone else /
we are the direct people //
In a sense we OWN the kids //
If you want the children to be doing the work /
You’ve got to get the classroom teacher /
not the curriculum coordinator or [the next speaker interrupts Jane]
Questions:
1. Looking carefully at Jane’s language, how is she building, constructing, or
construing (however we want to put it) the sorts relationships she and
teachers like her have to other sorts of people (e.g., children in her class 
 124 Building Things in the World
and school) and institutions? Point to specific things Jane says and the
way she says them to answer this question.
2. What sort of relationship is Karen building to those present and listening
to her through the way in which she is using language?
3. When Jane says “In a sense we OWN the kids,” what do you think she
means? Why does she use emphatic stress on “own”?
Problem 27
Below is a posting on a website made by a fifteen-year-old girl who writes
stories (“fan fiction”) using software that comes with the computer game The
Sims. You will see this data again in Section 4.5 below. The girl’s stories are
made up of pictures (from the game) and words (each “slide” has an image
and text beneath it). This girl writes novel-length stories of this sort, one of
which is called Lincoln Heights (“LH”). She has a devoted following of fans
that wait for each new chapter of the story to be posted. Below is a message
she sent out to her fan base. Discuss how this girl (an author) is building her
relationship with her fans (who are also teenage girls).

3.12 The Politics Building Tool
As I said in Section 3.3, I am going to use the term “politics” in this book in a
special way. By “politics,” I mean, not government and political parties, but
any situation where the distribution of social goods is at stake. By “social
goods” I mean anything a social group or society takes as a good worth having.
We use language to build and destroy social goods. There are lots of social
goods in any society. Some are things that are viewed as social goods by nearly
everyone in a society. Others are viewed as social goods only by some subgroup or sub-groups in the society. For example, in the United States, some
people view being able to carry guns in public as a social good and others do
not. When those who do not view carrying guns as a social good seek to
deprive those who do of their guns, the gun carriers see themselves as having
been deprived not just of guns but of a social good, one for which they are
willing to fight. The gun opponents see the social good as a gun-free society.
Almost all humans view being treated with respect or deference as a social
good. They also view being treated with solidarity by those they like as a social 
Building Things in the World 125
good. These can come into conflict. Being respectful and showing deference
means being formal and creating a certain distance between people. If I expect
solidarity from you and I get a respectful distance, I may be hurt. On the other
hand, showing solidarity means being informal, friendly, and close. If I expect
a respectful distance from you and I get solidarity, I may feel you are being too
personal and assuming too much about our friendship.
All humans have what sociologists call “face needs.” “Face” is the sense of
worth or dignity each of us has and wants to be honored by others in society.
Face is something that can be lost, maintained, or enhanced. We have such
idioms as “losing face” and “saving face.” There are two major types of “face
needs” people have. Each person has what are called “negative face” needs.
They want their privacy respected and they do not want others to impose on
them. This is the face they turn away from others unless they choose to
interact with them. But each person also has what are called “positive face”
needs. They want to belong and to be involved and, thus, do not want people
to leave them out. This is the face people turn toward others.
Different people, often based on cultural differences, but sometimes just as
an individual matter, have a different balance between these two face needs.
Some people prefer that others be very careful about imposing on them. They
value negative face needs more than positive face needs. Other people prefer
involvement and want people to err on the side of interacting and involving
them in things. They value positive face needs more than negative face needs.
Some cultures lean one way and other cultures the other way. All people have
both needs, but they balance them differently and expect different things in
different contexts.
Consider what can happen when two strangers are waiting at a bus stop.
After a while some people feel it is rude not to talk to the other person. They
favor involvement and think that ignoring the other person or being ignored
by the other person is disrespectful. They expect positive face needs (needs for
involvement) to operate in this situation. On the other hand, some people
think that a stranger talking to them is being disrespectful of their right to be
left alone and to determine how and when they get involved. They find a
stranger talking to them an imposition. They expect negative face needs
(needs for privacy) to operate in this situation.
Making a request of someone can be “face threatening,” that is, seen as an
imposition or a form of over-involvement. For example, in some circumstances
if I say “Do you want to go to dinner,” you might feel that the request has put
you on the spot. It is hard to say “no” without harming my face need for
involvement. You feel my question has imposed on you in a way that you don’t
like. So I have harmed your face need for privacy and not being imposed upon.
At the same time, in some circumstances if I do not ask I will offend you because
I have harmed your positive face needs by not including and involving you.
In a pluralistic society with many different types of people in it, it can be
difficult for people to navigate face needs and not offend other people. 
 126 Building Things in the World
Sometimes we find we have been too personal and assumed a desire to be
involved where there is none. Sometimes we find we have been too distant
when there was a desire for more closeness and personal involvement.
Face needs are large and general categories of social goods. We can honor
or dishonor these face needs in many different ways.
Another large and general category of social goods which can be given or
withheld in many different ways are things like having ourselves, our
behaviors, or our possessions treated as “normal,” “appropriate,” “correct,”
“natural,” “worthy,” or “good.” Of course, standards for these can change in
different contexts and across different social and cultural groups.
I once worked at a university where each year the school I was in had a
conference where graduate students presented their work. The conference
was organized by the graduate students themselves. When making the
schedule one year, the organizers put together a session called “alternative
research methods.” One student whose paper was placed in this session was
incensed. She felt insulted. She took the term “alternative” to mean she was
not mainstream or “normal.” She demanded an apology, as did others who
supported her. On the other hand, some people would take the term
“alternative research methods” to mean “better” or “newer” methods and be
proud to be “special” and not classed with “mainstream” research in their
area. Nonetheless, taking what people do or say, or what they are, as not
normal, natural, acceptable, correct, good, or worthy when and where they
view these things as social goods can be a source of major insult and conflict.
When we are using language, then, one thing we build is what counts for
us as social goods. We also distribute these to or withhold them from others,
as well as to the groups, cultures, and institutions to which people belong.
And, finally, we build viewpoints about how we think social goods are or
should be distributed in society or among social and cultural groups. This is,
for me, how and where language is “political.” I use the term “political” here
because a great deal of the work of government, elections, and political
parties at all levels is devoted to conflict and negotiation over social goods
and how they should be distributed. So, too, are social interactions and
conflicts throughout society.
So we can introduce another building tool:
Tool #18: The Politics Building Tool
For any communication, ask how words and grammatical devices are being
used to build (construct, assume) what counts as a social good and to distribute
this good to or withhold it from listeners or others. Ask, as well, how words and
grammatical devices are being used to build a viewpoint on how social goods are
or should be distributed in society.
Building Things in the World 127
Let’s look at an example of the Politics Building Tool at work. Below I print
data from an interview with a middle-school girl named Karin. Karin goes to
a prestigious but public school in a very wealthy neighborhood in the United
States. Students from her school go on to the country’s best colleges. At this
point in the interview Karin is being asked whether she believes that the
quality of her school gives her advantages that kids at much poorer schools do
not have.
Interviewer: … just say that it’s a really really poor neighborhood um or a ghetto
school, and, um, do you feel like somebody who goes to school there would have a
chance, um, to succeed or become what they want to become?
Not as good as they would in a good school system //
It depends on—
 I know that they probably don’t //
 If they don’t have enough money /
they might not have enough to put into the school system //
and not, may not be able to pay the teachers and /
 um, the good supplies and the textbooks and everything //
So maybe they wouldn’t, they probably wouldn’t have the same chance //
But, I believe that every person has equal chances /
um, to become what they want to be //
Karin is being asked an explicit question about social goods. Are children
in poor schools denied social goods that they need for success in society?
Karin first makes it clear that she thinks they are: “So maybe they wouldn’t,
they probably wouldn’t have the same chance.” She also makes clear that
the social good they and their school lacks is money. Karin expresses a
theory about good schools as a social good and poor schools as a lack of
that social good: a lack of money leads to less good teachers and supplies
and this can negatively affect the future chances of children who go to
these schools.
At the end, however, Karin seems to contradict this view she has expressed.
She says: “But, I believe that every person has equal chances / um, to become
what they want to be.” It is unclear how the children in the poor school
“wouldn’t have the same chance” and yet “every person has equal chances to
become what they want to be.” Karin, in the latter statement, is expressing a
very different view of how social goods are distributed in society. Now, she
construes the distribution as fair.
Notice, too, how Karin expresses her view that poor kids do not have equal
chances in probabilistic terms: “I know that they probably don’t” and “So
maybe they wouldn’t, they probably wouldn’t have the same chance.” Here we
get “probably” and “maybe.” On the other hand, she expresses her view about
everyone having equal chances in much more certain terms: “I believe that
every person has equal chances.”
 128 Building Things in the World
What is going on here? The viewpoint that every person has an equal
chance to succeed if he or she tries hard enough is one of the most pervasive
beliefs in American society. It is a common sense theory that many Americans
hold about the distribution of social goods that heavily discounts the
workings of poverty and discrimination (see Section 4.6 below on “social
models” and “figured worlds”). Karin holds this view and expresses it
clearly. At the same time, the interview has caused her to reflect a good deal
on the advantages her school brings her and the disadvantages a much
poorer school might bring others. Nonetheless, this reflection does not
cause her to question her view about success and everyone having an equal
shot at success in the United States.
We know from interviews with a number of young people at Karin’s school
that they were deeply concerned about being successful in society (which for
them meant becoming professionals like their parents). They know that there
is great competition for prestigious colleges and jobs. They also want badly to
believe not only that they will be successful, but that they will have earned
that success “fairly” through hard work and not just through the advantages
of social class and wealth.
Thus, Karin wants to concede that poor kids are disadvantaged by poor
schools, since she very much hopes her school and education will
advantage her in the face of the stiff competition she will face to get into a
good college and obtain a good job. At the same time, she wants also to
believe that all people have fair chances, that hard work will bring her
success, and that her success will have been “fairly” earned and stem from
her worth and not her advantages. Indeed, to tell Karin that her success in
school now and in the future is due not to her but to her circumstances
would be to threaten her face needs for respect as a “worthy” and “good”
human being.
It is common in communication for all of us that we seek to balance our
conflicting desires, needs, and beliefs. Karin is not special or benighted in this
respect at all. When we build with language we are often trying both to reflect
reality as we see it and to see reality—and construe it—in ways that make us
feel like humans worthy both of respect (for our achievements) and as
involved with others (as one of them, not unfairly advantaged or set apart in
any unfair way).
At the same time, Karin’s interview shows that confronting people with
“facts,” even facts they concede, does not necessarily get them to change
deeply seated theories about the world—and there are few theories as deep
seated as our views about social goods and how they are and should be
distributed. We will later discuss people’s theories about the world and how
these theories shape their language and actions when we introduce the terms
“social models” and “figured worlds” for theories like Karin’s model of success
(i.e., the viewpoint that everyone has an equal chance in the United States if
they work hard enough).

3.13 Working with the Politics Building Tool
Problem 28
The data below is from an interview with a middle-school teacher. The teacher
teaches in the town we discussed in Section 3.9 when we looked at Maria’s
data. As we said in Section 3.9, the town is a former blue-collar industrial
town that has lost a good deal of its industry and is in a poor economic
condition. There are not a lot of jobs and those that there are often no longer
carry good wages and medical benefits. Many of the parents in the town—
Asian, Black, or Hispanic—work more than one job to make ends meet and
there is high unemployment.
The teacher has been asked about whether she ever discusses social issues
with her students. A part of her response is printed below. In the transcript,
“I” stands for “Interviewer.” Words in brackets are guesses about what was
said when it cannot be well heard on the tape. “[????]” means material is
inaudible.
1. Uh so [what] you you need to do about job hunting /
2. You need to look the part // [I:mm hm]
3. You don’t see anybody at any nice store dressed in jeans // [I: uh huh]
4. They’re not gonna have a job if they do that // [I: uh huh]
5. And a lot of the kids question that //
6. uh I talk about housing /
7. We talk about the [????], we talk about a lot of the low income things //
8. I said “Hey wait a minute” /
9. I said, “Do you think the city’s gonna take care of an area that you don’t
take care of yourself”? [I: uh huh]
10. I said, “How [many of] you [have] been up Saints Street”?
11. They raise their hands /
12. I say “How about Main Ave.”?
13. That’s where those gigantic houses are /
14. I said, “How many pieces of furniture are sitting in the front yard”?
[I: mm hm]
15. “Well, none” //
16. I said “How much trash is lying around”?
 130 Building Things in the World
17. “None” //
18. I said, “How many houses are spray painted”?
19. “How many of them have kicked in, you know have broken down cars in
front of them”? [I: uh huh]
20. I said, “They take care of their area” /
21. I said, “I’m not saying you kids do this” /
22. I said, “Look at Great River Valley /
23. They burn the dumpsters //
24. That’s your housing area” // [I: uh huh]
25. “Do you know how fast that can JUMP into someone’s apartment or
whatever else”?
26. I bring up the uh, they have in the paper /
27. Probably about two years ago /
28. The uh police were being sued—
29. Uh the fire department were being sued by a family that had a girl with
asthma /
30. And the kids had lit the dumpster outside of their bedroom window /
31. And she had a severe asthma attack /
32. And the fire department would not come in /
33. So they couldn’t get the police escort //
34. The fire department used to only go in with a police escort /
35. Because the people living there would throw bottles and cans at them //
[I: uh huh]
36. And you know, again, the whole class would [???] //
37. I don’t understand this //
38. Here is someone who’s coming in here—
39. Maybe the police I could understand /
40. Because you feel like you’re getting harassed by the police /
41. What has the fire department done to you /
42. That you’re gonna throw bottles, rocks, cans at them? [I: uh huh]
43. And stop them from putting out a fire [I: uh huh] that could burn down
your whole house? [I: uh huh]
44. Why do you burn the grass? [I: mm hm]
45. There’s grass here that every single summer as soon as it turns green they
burn /
46. And as soon as it grows back up they burn again //
47. Why do you do that?
Questions:
1. Go through this data line by line and discuss how this teacher is
building or construing what count as social goods and how they are
distributed.
Building Things in the World 131
2. Why are there broken down cars in front of the houses in some poor
neighborhoods and not in richer ones? Where are the broken down cars
in rich neighborhoods?
3. Some people would see what the teacher is talking about in terms of
“social class.” Socioeconomic classes in a society are inherently about
social goods and their distribution. Does the teacher? How does the
teacher construe social class?
4. The teacher at many points performs dialogue she has had in her
classroom. This dialogue is, of course, being enacted here for the
interviewer. However, she is depicting how she talks to her students.
How does talking to the students in this way position them in terms of
social goods and how they are distributed? Is the teacher “blaming the
victim”?
5. In line 21 the teacher says: “I said, ‘I’m not saying you kids do this’.” What
do you make of this? What is she saying about the children (“you kids”)?
What does this have to do with social goods?
6. At the end of the data above the teacher says:
Why do you burn the grass? [I: mm hm]
There’s grass here that every single summer as soon as it turns green they burn /
And as soon as it grows back up they burn again //
Why do you do that?
Here “Why do you burn the grass?” seems to be a question that the teacher
is pretending to put to the students. She then switches from “you” to
“they” in “There’s grass here that every single summer as it turns green
they burn / And as soon as it grows back up they burn it again.” She then
switches back to “you” in “Why do you do that?.” What do you think the
teacher is trying to do here? Think about this question in relation to
question 5 above. How is she positioning herself in relationship to the
interviewer and to her students? How does she position the interviewer in
relation to the students?
7. In line 35 the teacher says that “people” (not necessarily children) throw
rocks at the firemen. Then she reverts to “you” and says things like
“Maybe the police I could understand / Because you feel like you’re getting
harassed by the police / What has the fire department done to you? And
stop them from putting out a fire [I: uh huh] that could burn down your
whole house?.” Who does “you” refer to in these sentences? Go through
the whole data and discuss what “you” refers to in each case and how
“you” is functioning in this communication as a whole (at time “you”
may be ambiguous). What does this have to do with social goods?
 132 Building Things in the World
3.14 The Connections Building Tool
Connections
Things in the world can be seen as connected and relevant to each other (or
not) in a great many different ways. We use language to connect or disconnect
things and to make things relevant to each other or not. If I say “The king and
queen died,” I treat the two deaths as simultaneous or, at least, as though the
difference in timing did not matter. If I say “The king died and then the queen
died,” I imply the queen’s death has something to do with the king’s. If I say
“The king died and then the queen died from grief” or “The queen died
because the king died” I make the connection explicit.
Some things in the world are really connected, for example cigarette
smoking really does cause cancer. However, we can still treat such connections
in different ways in how we speak in different contexts. For example, consider
the sentence below:
Lung cancer death rates are clearly associated with an increase in smoking.
Let’s consider for a moment how this sentence uses wording and grammar to
make connections. The phrase “are clearly associated with” does not say
smoking causes lung cancer. It just says the two are correlated or associated in
some way. The sentence also does not say who is getting lung cancer from
smoking, whether it is just the smokers or non-smokers who inhale secondary
smoke. It says nothing about the connections here. A version of this sentence
like: “Lung cancer deaths of smokers and non-smokers (via second-hand
smoke) are caused by increased smoking in a society” would make different
and more direct connections.
Sometimes connections are not made explicit because the speaker assumes
the listener will make them. The speaker leaves such connections to the Filling
In Tool. At other times speakers want to manipulate more overtly how listeners
think about particular connections and what connections they make in their
minds, so they word what they have to say to accomplish these goals.
So we can state yet another of our building tools:
Tool #19: The Connections Building Tool
For any communication, ask how the words and grammar being used in the
communication connect or disconnect things or ignore connections between
things. Always ask, as well, how the words and grammar being used in a
communication make things relevant or irrelevant to other things, or ignores
their relevance to each other.
Building Things in the World 133
Let’s look at one more example of how words and grammar are used to build
connections and the Connections Building Tool in action. Consider the
sentences below from a talk by the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick
(Retrieved September 26 from http://deoxy.org/pkd_how2build.htm):
The basic tool for the manipulation of reality is the manipulation of words. If you
can control the meaning of words, you can control the people who must use the
words.
This sentence first connects reality and words: words are tools for manipulating
reality. But it isn’t really words that manipulate reality, it is the manipulation
of words and that is something speakers and writers do. The second sentence
connects words and people: speakers or writers can control people through
their control of the meanings of words. They do not control these people by
controlling their non-verbal actions but by controlling what words they in
turn use. Later in his talk Dick makes clear that the words people are
manipulated to use (and he adds the images used in the media) affect reality
by causing people to perceive reality in certain ways and to behave in certain
ways.
By pairing “manipulation of reality” with “manipulation of words” in his
first sentence and “control the meanings of words” and “control people” in his
second sentence, Dick sets up an almost puppet like version of the connections
between words and reality. The speaker or writer pulls (manipulates, controls)
the strings and the puppet (people) say what he or she wants them to say.
Speakers and writers who can manipulate words or control meaning (and
Dick is a professional writer) put words into people’s mouths and thereby
control their perceptions and behavior and thus, too, reality.
Now presumably any and every speaker manipulates words and controls
meanings whenever he or she speaks. That is what language is about after all.
This common trait we all share cannot be what Dick is talking about or we
would all be controlling reality and each other every time we speak and none
of us would be more powerful than any others of us. Presumably he means to
say that people who are good, adept, or skilled at manipulating words and
controlling meanings are the powerful ones who control other people and
reality. Dick’s sentences are in that sense special pleading for the power of
“professionals” of speaking (e.g., politicians) and writing (e.g., novelists) and
image making (e.g., the media).
There is a paradox with the connections Dick has created. He sets up the
following connections: Manipulate words (well)  control the meanings of
words  control the words other people use  control their perceptions and
behavior  control reality. But now that Dick has told us of this power of
writers—and himself as a writer—why would we not think that anything he
said or wrote was meant only to manipulate and control us? Would not he
now have lost his power?
 134 Building Things in the World
Dick, of course, wants us to trust him. His target is other manipulators:
…today we live in a society in which spurious realities are manufactured by the
media, by governments, by big corporations, by religious groups, political
groups—and the electronic hardware exists by which to deliver these pseudoworlds right into the heads of the reader, the viewer, the listener.
But, then, the real question would become how do we know when we are
being manipulated and when we are not? Is the (view of) reality Dick goes on
to offer in his talk “spurious” or not? In the quote above Dick makes the
connection between words (and images) and manipulation of people quite
direct: “deliver these pseudo-worlds right into the heads of the reader, the
viewer, the listener.” The agency of the reader, the viewer, the listener is not
mentioned; people’s ability to think about, reflect on, and reject messages is
not highlighted. Thus, agency is not rendered relevant to the way Dick sees
words and images working in society.
At the same time, this view of manipulation leaves us as readers of Dick’s
talk to ask the following question: When and if we agree with his view of
reality (which is a striking one), do we agree because we are being reflective
agents or just because Dick has become a better wordsmith and manipulator
than his enemies? How would we know? It is an interesting question whether
the sorts of connections between words, reality, and people’s perceptions and
their behavior that Dick wants to make could have been made in a different
way so as to have avoided this dilemma that Dick has created for himself.

Grammar Interlude # 8: Cohesion
In Grammar Interlude #4 we talked about the way clauses can be integrated
together into single sentences. But speakers and writers have to do more than
connect clauses within sentences. They must also connect sentences across whole
oral or written texts. The grammatical devices we use to create such connections
are called cohesive devices. They signal to the listener or reader the connections
among the sentences of a communication and are part of what makes a spoken or
written communication sound like it “hangs together” (coheres).
There are six major types of cohesive devices. Examples of each of them
(numbered in reference to the following discussion) are seen in the little
discourse on the next page (note that the second sentence has been placed
vertically):
Building Things in the World 135
The Federal Government expected Indian Nations to sign treaties.
 However, though = 6
 most of = 2
 them = 1
 had in fact = 6
 done so, = 3
 the = 2
 Seminoles = 5
 would not . = 4
Each of the numbered words or phrases is a cohesive device that signals to the
hearer how the second sentence is linked (or how it coheres) with the
preceding sentence. Below, I list the six major classes of cohesive devices and
show how the member of that class represented in our example above
functions. The numbers below correspond to those used in the example.
1. Pronouns. In the example, the pronoun “them” links back to the preceding
sentence by picking up its reference from a phrase in that sentence
(“Indian Nations”).
2. Determiners and Quantifiers. The quantifier “most” links to the preceding
sentence by indicating that we are now talking about a part (“most”) of a
whole that was talked about in the preceding sentence (“Indian Nations”).
The determiner “the” in front of “Seminoles” links to the preceding
sentence by indicating that the information it is attached to (“Seminoles”)
is information that is assumed to be predictable or known on the basis of
the preceding sentence. In this case, it is predictable because the preceding
sentence mentioned Indian Nations and Seminoles are an Indian Nation.
3. Substitution. The words “done so” are a dummy phrase that substitutes for
(stands in for) “signed treaties” in the previous sentence. This allows us
both not to repeat this information and to signal that the second sentence
is linked to the preceding one.
4. Ellipsis. The blank after “would not” indicates a place where information
has been left out (elided) because it is totally predictable based on the
preceding sentence (the information is “sign a treaty”). Since we
reconstruct the left out information by considering the preceding sentence
this ellipsis is a linking device.
5. Lexical cohesion. The word “Seminoles” is lexically related to “Indian”
since Seminoles are Indians. This links the two sentences together through
the fact that they contain words that are semantically related. Lexical
cohesion can involve exact repletion of words or repetition of words that
are related to each other.
6. Conjunctions, adjunctive adverbs, and other conjunction-like links. The
word “however” signals how the hearer is to relate the second sentence
to the first. It signals that there is an adversative relation between the 
 136 Building Things in the World
two sentences. “In fact” also links the second sentence to the first,
though in a way that is subtle enough and hard enough to describe that
it is possible that only native speakers would get its placement just right
in a variety of cases. Related to this category are “discourse particles,”
words like “so” and “well” that also help tie sentences together into
meaningfully related chains of sentences that “sound” like they go
together.
Let’s consider a moment how cohesion works in the text below:
Also secure, by 1689, was the principle of representative government, as tested
against the two criteria for valid constitutions proposed in the previous chapter.
As to the first criterion, there was a genuine balance of power in English society,
expressing itself in the Whig and Tory parties. As narrowly confined to the
privileged classes as these were, they nonetheless represented different factions
and tendencies. Elections meant real choice among separate, contending parties
and personalities.
The author devotes a great deal of the words and grammatical devices in this
passage to cohesion. He uses the phrase “as to the first criterion” in his second
sentence to tie back to the phrase “two criteria” in the first sentence. In the
third sentence, he uses a pronoun inside a subordinate clause in its sentence
(“as narrowly confined to the privileged classes as these were”) and another
pronoun in the main clause (“they”) to tie back to “the Whig and Tory parties”
in the preceding sentence. His final sentence about elections is not tied to the
previous sentences in any explicit way (in fact, “elections” comes rather “out
of the blue” here), for example, the author does not use any logical connectors
like “and therefore.”
The final sentence about elections is, however, tied to the previous sentences
by lexical (word-level) relations. “Elections” is a word that is in the same
semantic (meaning) family as the words in phrases like “different factions and
tendencies,” “the Whig and Tory parties,” “balance of power,” “constitutions,”
and “representative government” in the previous sentences (these are all
words and phrases about governing and government). This connects
“elections” back to these sentences. The author seems to suggest, by this
tactic, that his claim about elections—i.e., that they constituted a “real
choice”—follows rather straightforwardly from the very meaning of what he
has previously said. He treats his claim about meaningful elections as needing
no more explicit logical connection to what has come before than that. He
treats it almost as a mere restatement of what he has already said, despite the
fact that a critical reader might worry about how meaningful (and for whom)
these elections among the “privileged classes” were.
Thus, we can state another grammatical tool:
Building Things in the World 137
Tool #20: The Cohesion Tool
For any communication, ask questions like: How does cohesion work in this
text to connect pieces of information and in what ways? How does the text fail
to connect other pieces of information? What is the speaker trying to
communicate or achieve by using cohesive devices in the way he or she does?
Problem 29
Consider the utterance below. This is from a teacher in the history project we
have discussed several times so far. She was supposed to bring maps to the
meeting she is in so the people in the meeting could plan what neighborhoods
children would study:
I do have all the maps //
Unfortunately, my source said that the city of Middleview no longer has any of the
big ones //
They’re not being printed //
I do have three or four //
Discuss how this speaker uses cohesion to tie her clauses and sentences
together across her entire utterance. Check each word in each sentence (and
what is left out—ellipsis) to see if it plays a role in tying sentences together.
Problem 30
The text below is from a young woman with schizophrenia who is telling a
therapist a story about how much she loved horses as a kid and how she
worked at a camp taking care of horses (so she is associated by the other girls
at the camp with the horses):
1. That was at summer camp / Camp Quonset / a girl’s camp I worked at //
2. And all the other girls my age / they were rich //
3. They were all going to camp there //
4. And they / uh most of them were sort of afraid of horses //
5. So I couldn’t get to be very friendly with them / where they wanted to come
around / and hang around with me or anything / because they were more or
less afraid //
Counting each numbered line here as a sentence, discuss cohesion in this
communication. What type of cohesion device is operating after the word
“afraid” in (5)? There is a crucial ambiguity here. What is it? Why do you 
 138 Building Things in the World
think it occurred? Has the speaker used this cohesive device to create this
ambiguity as a form of communication?

3.15 Working with the Connections Building Tool
In this section I will give you some data that you can use to work with the
Connections Building Tool. When people speak and write they engage in
several or all of the seven building tasks at once. So, too, we discourse analysts
must often use several or all of the seven building tools at once. So here think,
as you apply the Connections Building Tool, how all the other building tools
you have seen so far would apply to the data below, as well. Remember that
cohesion is only one way to signal connections. There are many others
(though they do not fall into such a neat grammatical system as does cohesion).
Pay attention to as many as you can.
Problem 31
Once again we will consider data below from the history project we have
discussed in Section 1.6 and elsewhere in this book. The project involved an
historian, an educational researcher, undergraduate students, and teachers
working together. The historian (Sara) and the educational researcher (Ariel)
had brought in two curriculum consultants to help them work with the
teachers in building curriculum for the project. At a meeting where the
teachers had objected to not having been consulted on a grant proposal that if
successful would have involved children in their classrooms (see data in
Section 3.11—where Jane was speaking), one of the two curriculum
consultants tried to defend the project and the confusions that had been part
of it. Part of her communication is printed below.
1. There’s a there’s a big complicated process /
2. Of working through the materials /
3. Figuring out how to teach it /
4. Which is called curriculum development //
5. And that’s what we’re involved in now /
6. And it’s very murky /
7. And it’s very complicated /
8. And we we don’t know where we’re going /
Building Things in the World 139
9. But that’s an innate part of curriculum development /
10. Unfortunately /
11. Especially when you work with a group of people /
12. And you’re not just doing it yourself //
13. Um so /
14. And that’s where Sandy and I were hired /
15. As sort of the hired guns /
16. To come in and help facilitate it /
17. Because we know you don’t have the time //
18. Um and and um Sara and Ariel /
19. Didn’t don’t have the experience /
20. Of working in the classroom /
21. And they teach in a different structure /
22. Which is very different //
23. And so /
24. So we’re there as the helping hands to give you /
25. To to help you where you need /
26. And to act as sort of the interpreters /
27. And the shapers /
28. But in response to what is necessary //
29. I mean /
30. We’re not coming in to do something that we want to do //
31. We’re trying to facilitate what you want to do //
Questions:
1. What sorts of connections is this speaker (a curriculum consultant on the
project) building? What sort of connection does she build between herself
and the teachers? Between herself and the two academics (Sara and Ariel)?
Between herself and curriculum development? Between teachers and
curriculum development? Between the two academics and curriculum
development?
2. Both Sara and Ariel are college professors and teach college students in
classrooms, as the speaker concedes in line 12. So why does she say they
don’t have “the experience of working in the classroom” in lines 10 and
11? Why is the word “classroom” here used to mean only classrooms of
teachers who do not teach at the college level, but not college professors?
What does this tell you about the connections the speaker is building
between teachers, professors, and classrooms? [Note how we often use
“teacher” for non-college teachers and “professor” for people who teach
in colleges and how “classroom teacher” seems never to mean a person
teaching at the college level. Even when we say that someone teaches at a
“teaching college” and not a research-based university, we still call him or
her a professor and not a teacher.]
 140 Building Things in the World
3. In lines 15 and 16 the speaker switches word choice from “give you” to
“help you.” Why? There is a certain tension here, what is it? Are there
other indications of this tension in the data?
4. How does the Politics Building Tool apply to this data?
Problem 32
The data below is from a college professor being interviewed about her views
on race in society. This professor works at a college in the town where the
history project took place, but at a different college from Sara and Ariel.
Interviewer: . . . How, do you see racism happening, in society, let’s put it that way.
1. Um, well, I could answer on, on a variety of different levels // [I: uh huh]
2. Um, at the most macro level /
3. Uum, I think that there’s um, um /
4. I don’t want to say this in a way that sounds like a conspiracy / [I: mm hm]
5. But I think um, that um, basically that the lives of people of color are are, are
irrelevant to the society anymore // [I: mm hm]
6. Um, they’re not needed for the economy because we have the third world to
run away into for cheap labor // [I: uh huh]
7. Um, and I think that, that the leadership /
8. This country really doesn’t care if they shoot each other off in in the ghettos
/ [I: uh huh]
9. Um, and, and so they let drugs into the ghettos /
10. And they, um, they, let people shoot themselves /
11. Shoot each other /
12. And they don’t have, a police force that is really gonna, um, work /
13. And they cut the programs that might alleviate some of the problems //
14. And, um—
15. So I think there’s /
16. That it’s manifested at, at the most, structural level as, um, you know, a real
hatred, of, of, of uh people of color //[I: uh huh]
17. And, and it’s shown, in, the cutbacks and so forth //
18. And, um, I think that um, that, it’s, it’s reflected in, in the fact that, they’re,
they’re viewed as, expendable / [I: mm hm]
19. By our leadership //
20. Um, and so I think, I see cutbacks in programs as just a, an example of, of a
broader / [I: mm hm]
21. You know, sense, that, that, from the point of view of, of those in power /
22. People of color are expendable / [I: uh huh]
23. And, and irrelevant //
Building Things in the World 141
Questions:
1. How does this speaker build (see) the connections among “people of
color,” “society,” the “third world,” and “leadership” (of the country)?
2. In line 4 the speaker says “I don’t want to say this in a way that sounds
like a conspiracy.” Why does she say this? Does she say it in a way that
sounds like a conspiracy or not? How do connections work in so-called
“conspiracy theories”?
3. This professor is being interviewed by the same interviewer who
interviewed the teacher in Section 3.13 (Working with the Politics
Building Tool). Go back and look at that data. Who gives the people they
are talking about (in the case of the professor, “people of color,” and in
the case of the teacher, her working class students and the people who
live where they do) more agency? How do the professor and the teacher
see the world in terms of connections differently? Even though they live
and work in the same town, the interviewer asked the professor how she
thought about race in society and the teacher if she ever dealt with social
issues like race and class in her classroom. Why this difference in
questions? Does it surprise you? How does it help shape the sorts of
answers the interviewees give and the connections they make?
3.16 The Sign Systems and Knowledge Building Tool
We use language to build up (or privilege) or denigrate various sign systems
(communicational systems) and different ways of knowing the world. There
are many different languages (e.g., Spanish, Russian, English). There are many
different varieties of any one language (e.g., different dialects, as well language
varieties like the language of lawyers, biologists, and hip-hop artists). There
are communicative systems that are not language (e.g., equations, graphs,
images) or at least not just language (e.g., hip hop, poetry, ads with pictures
and words). These are all different sign systems.
All these different sign systems are important to the people who use them
and at least partly define their identities in terms of them. People are often
deeply connected to and committed to their dialect. Lawyers are committed to
talking like lawyers. Hip hop fans are passionate about hip hop. There are
even arguments over where and when Spanish should be spoken in the United
States. Physicists believe the language of mathematics is superior to languages
like English for explicit communication.
Furthermore, different sign systems represent different views of knowledge
and belief, different ways of knowing the world. As we said, physicists believe
the language of mathematics is superior to English for producing and
communicating knowledge about the physical world. Poets believe poetry is a
higher form of knowing and insight, as do, in another sense, people who use
religious varieties of language. Speakers of Black Vernacular English believe 
 142 Building Things in the World
there are some things that can be expressed or felt in that dialect better than
they can in standard English. So, too, for Spanish–English bilinguals who
favor one language or the other for different topics or emotions. Statisticians
believe statistics is a deep way of understanding reality, while some qualitative
researchers do not or, at least, believe the language of statistics has spread too
far in our understanding of the social world.
We humans contest over the value of different languages and other sorts of
sign systems. We contest, as well, over different ways of knowing the world.
We can use language to make or construe certain sign systems and certain
forms of knowledge and belief as better or worse than others, as relevant or
privileged or not in a given context. We can build privilege or prestige for one
sign system over others or for one way of claiming knowledge over other
ways. For example, I can talk and act so as to make the knowledge and
language of lawyers relevant (privileged) or not over “everyday language” or
over “non-lawyerly academic language” in our committee discussion of
facilitating the admission of more minority students.
So we can introduce the last of our seven building tools, the Sign Systems
and Knowledge Building Tool:
Tool #21: Systems and Knowledge Building Tool
For any communication, ask how the words and grammar being used privilege
or de-privilege specific sign systems (e.g., Spanish vs. English, technical
language vs. everyday language, words vs. images, words vs. equations, etc.) or
different ways of knowing and believing or claims to knowledge and belief?
The Sign Systems and Knowledge Building Tool is clearly closely related to
the Politics Building Tool. This is so because the mastery, use, and maintenance
of languages, dialects, sign systems, and ways of knowing the world are, for
the people who “own” them, social goods. Thus, when we use language to
build them up or tear them down, we are engaged in politics in the sense of
building viewpoints on the distribution of social goods in society. But
language, sign systems, and ways of knowing the world are so important to
people and distinctive for human beings that we separate them out as
particularly important social goods over which people negotiate and contest
in the world.
Let’s discuss an example of data where the Sign Systems and Knowledge
Building Tool applies. Consider the two excerpts below written by the same
biologist on the same topic. The first is for a scientific journal; the second is
for a popular science magazine read by non-scientists (e.g., National
Geographic, Natural History). These examples reflect two major styles within
professional scientific writing, each of which uses distinct kinds of language
and represents a distinctive way of knowing the world. 
Building Things in the World 143
1. Experiments show that Heliconius butterflies are less likely to oviposit on
host plants that possess eggs or egg-like structures. These egg-mimics are
an unambiguous example of a plant trait evolved in response to a hostrestricted group of insect herbivores.
2. Heliconius butterflies lay their eggs on Passiflora vines. In defense the
vines seem to have evolved fake eggs that make it look to the butterflies
as if eggs have already been laid on them.
Let’s consider the differences between these two texts. The first excerpt,
published in a professional scientific journal, is concerned with furthering
conceptual understanding within a sub-discipline of biology. Its language is
carefully developed to do this—to build evidence and marshal support for
certain biological claims within particular parts of the biological community.
The subject of its initial sentence is “experiments,” a primary methodological
tool in biology. The subject of the next sentence is “these egg mimics.” Note
here how parts of the plant (“these egg mimics”) are named, not in terms of the
plant itself, but in terms of the role they play in a particular theory of natural
selection and evolution, namely, co-evolution of predator and prey (co-evolution
means that two species interact with each other over a long period of time so as
to mutually shape each other’s evolution). Note, too, how they are framed as an
“unambiguous example” of the relation in question, a linguistic turn that
underscores the importance of the experiments being reported.
Looking further into this text, the butterflies are referred to as “a hostrestricted group of insect herbivores,” which points simultaneously to an
aspect of scientific methodology (as “experiments” did) and to the logic of a
theory (as “egg mimics” did). Scientists arguing for the theory of co-evolution
face the difficulty of demonstrating a causal connection between a particular
plant characteristic and a particular predator when most plants have many
different animals attacking them. To overcome this problem, they use a
strategic methodological technique: they study plant groups that are preyed
on by only one or a few predators (i.e., “host-restricted”). “Host-restricted
group of insect herbivores,” then, refers both to the relationship between
plant and insect that is at the heart of the theory of co-evolution and to the
methodological technique of focusing research on plants and insects that are
restricted to each other. This first excerpt, then, is concerned with addressing
a particular problem and advancing knowledge within biology; the language
of the text has been carefully shaped to communicate these concerns.
The second excerpt, published in a popular science magazine, is about
animals in nature, not methodology and theory or claims and arguments.
Scientists write for popular magazines to inform the public and to build public
support for their work and the field at large. Here, too, they shape their
language to meet these purposes. The language in the second example focuses
on nature itself as the subject, rather than the activity of science as in the first
text. In the second text, the subject of the first sentence is “butterflies” and the 
 144 Building Things in the World
subject of the second is “the vine.” In contrast with the first text, the butterflies
and vine are both labeled as such, rather than being described in terms of their
role in a particular theory. This second text is a story about the struggles of
insects and plants that are transparently open to the trained gaze of the
scientist (as opposed to inferences derived from clever experimental
manipulation, as suggested in the first text). The plant and insect are
dramatically represented as intentional actors: The plants act in their own
“defense” and things “look” a certain way to the insects, who are deceived by
appearances as humans sometimes are.
Interestingly, these two excerpts reflect a historical shift in the relationship
between the scientist and nature. In the history of biology, the biologist’s
relationship with nature has gradually changed from telling stories about
direct observations of nature (as in the excerpt from the popular science
magazine) to carrying out complex experiments to test complex theories (as
reflected in the excerpt from the professional journal). These two texts also
reflect a shift in curricular focus from early elementary science, where direct
observation is usually stressed, to upper level science education, where
experiment grows in importance. A shift in the academic nature of the
language used in the science classroom, from conversational, story-like styles
to more academic styles, likewise accompanies the transition from elementary
to high school.
Thus, these two texts, though written by the same person and about “the
same thing” (in one sense), are not the same. Each uses a distinctive style of
language—and each style is used in a different communication system (i.e.,
professional science, popular science)—and each represents and privileges, as
well, a different but distinctive way to know the world and make claims about
it. It is interesting that the way of knowing the world and the style of language
in the more popular text, the one for wider consumption, represents a way of
knowing and a style of language that the author and his discipline would
“dismiss” as “wrong” (perhaps, “misleading”) or “immature” in their more
professional disciplinary identities. The two texts are built to privilege two
different ways of knowing (theoretically-driven experimentation versus
observation in the world) and two different styles of language (specialist
scientific language versus popular science language).

3.17 Working with the Sign Systems and Knowledge Building Tool
Problem 33
The data below is once again from the history project. The group has had a
long and contentious meeting. This is the same meeting from which the data
in Sections 3.11 and 3.15 were taken. The meeting is now over and only Karen
and Jane (two teachers), Joe (an administrator from a school involved in the
project, though not Karen and Jane’s school), and Sara (the university
historian) are still present. They are engaging in “small talk”—no longer
talking about the project—before themselves leaving.
Karen, Jane, and Joe were all born in Middleview. So were their parents. Sara
was born and educated elsewhere, worked at Woodson University in Middleview
at the time of this project, and is now at another university in another state.
Read and reflect on the data below. Then answer the questions following
the data.
KAREN:
1. My mother used to talk about in the 40s /
2. You’d hang around at Union Station /
3. And anybody would just pick you up /
4. Because everybody was going down to dance at Bright City /
5. Whether you knew them or not //
JOE:
6. Lakeside Ballroom //
JANE:
7. Yeah definitely //
JOE:
8. My father used to work there //
JANE:
9. And also, once you finally get into the war situation /
10. Because you have Fort Derby /
11. Everybody would get a ride in to come to Bright City /
12. To the amusement park //
13. So it was this influx of two, three cars worth of guys /
14. That were now available to meet the girls that suddenly were there //
SARA:
15. Well actually street, street cars had just come in in this /
16. And as I recall um from a student who wrote a paper on this /
17. Bright City and Park was built by the street car company /
18. In order to have it a sort of target destination for people to go to /
19. And to symbiotically make money off of this //
 146 Building Things in the World
JANE:
20. Because once you got there /
21. You could take a boat ride /
22. And go up and down a lake /
23. And there were lots of other ways to get the money from people //
Questions:
1. How does the way in which Sara builds and privileges knowledge of the
world differ from how Karen, Jane, and Joe do? How does their ways of
using language build and privilege their different ways of claiming
knowledge about the world here?
2. What do Karen, Jane, and Joe base their claims on? What does Sara base
her claims on?
3. Is what Sara says potentially disruptive or rude in this context? Why is or
isn’t it?
4. What do you think of Jane’s remarks after Sara has spoken? Are they
responsive to Sara? How does what Jane says here connected to what Sara
said? To what Karen and Joe has said before?
5. In what ways is Sara at a disadvantage in this discussion?
6. Can you see any differences in the styles of language (the “social
languages”) Sara uses and the longtime Middleview residents use in this
episode of “small talk”?
Problem 34
In several states in the United States, bilingual education has become controversial.
Some people argue that immigrant children should be allowed to learn school
content (such as science and math) in their native language while they are also
learning English. Others argue that immigrant children should learn English
immediately and quickly and then be exposed to school content only in English.
The point of the data and questions below is to study how viewpoints on
language and languages are expressed (including your own). The point is not
to convince you here of one viewpoint on bilingual education or “Englishonly” as policy. If you are doing this exercise collaboratively, pay attention to
how you express your viewpoints and respect other people’s viewpoints (while
insisting, of course, that everyone offer fair arguments for those viewpoints).
In the state of Arizona, immigrant students are grouped in classrooms based
on English language proficiency determined by a test (the Arizona English
Language Learner Assessment—AZELLA). In these classrooms, the children
receive four hours of mandated skill-based English language instruction each
day. Teaching and learning does not include the content areas, such as science
or social studies. Students are segregated from native English speaking
students in these four-hour blocks. No bilingual education is allowed.
Building Things in the World 147
A proposition passed by voters (Proposition 203) led to the implementation
of this system. Here is part of what the proposition said:
 The English language is the national public language of the United States of
America and the state of Arizona …. Immigrant parents are eager to have their
children acquire a good knowledge of English, thereby allowing them to fully
participate in the American Dream of economic and social advancement….
Therefore it is resolved that: all children in Arizona public schools shall be taught
English as rapidly and effectively as possible. (Retrieved September 24, 2009 from
www.azsos.gov/election/2000/Info/pubpamphlet/english/prop203.htm)
Here is how the Arizona Department of Education frames the four-hour block policy:
The year of intensive instruction is designed to advance a student to English
language proficiency, thereby moving the student into the mainstream classroom
where they [sic] will have access to the curriculum allowing for academic success.
The language skills are pre-requisite skills to academic content. (Retrieved
September 24, 2009 from www.ade.state.az.us/oelas/sei/SEIModelsFAQs.doc)
Finally, printed below is one teacher’s view of the policy from an interview:
It’s racism. Blatant racism. There’s no other way to describe it. It’s against the 14th
amendment [of the U.S. Constitution]. It’s made specifically to isolate children
who are immigrants to this country. And that’s what it is, because if you’re an
immigrant, you’re coming in this class. And to say that there’s no time to teach
them science and social studies is against the 14th amendment of the Constitution.
It is segregation at its finest, because you are not providing the same educational
opportunities for the kids in that class that you are providing to native English
speakers. (Data from: Heineke, A. J. (2009). Teacher’s discourse on English language
learners: Cultural models of language and learning. Unpublished doctoral
dissertation. Mary Lou Fulton College of Education, Tempe, Arizona, p. 162)
Questions:
1. How does the language in the first two excerpts build a view of English in
relation to immigrant children and their families? What is that view?
2. Not saying something—staying silent about it—can be a way of privileging
what you do say, since you leave unsaid information that might make the
listener or reader think differently about your viewpoint. The third
excerpt from the teacher brings up things that are unsaid in the two
earlier excerpts. What are these? How do they change (if they do) how a
reader might respond to the two earlier excerpts if that reader kept this
unsaid information in mind?
3. Many people argue that in a global world, all children should know at
least two languages, both orally and for writing and reading. Skill with
language learning is seen as an important twenty-first century skill in a
global world. This is not said in any of the excerpts above. One could
imagine it as a state policy. If one accepts this claim about the importance 
 148 Building Things in the World
of being bilingual and bi-literate in a global world, how might this change
the way in which one responds to the excerpts above?
4. The second excerpt above says “The language skills are pre-requisite
skills to academic content.” This clearly means in context “English
language skills.” Why doesn’t it say so? If language skills are a prerequisite to [learning] academic content, then why would that not be an
argument to start teaching content in Spanish, for example, for Spanish
speaking children, while they are also learning English? Wouldn’t this
also mean these children would acquire literacy in Spanish and thus end
up bilingual and bi-literate in two languages (a seemingly good thing in a
global world)? Is this a contradiction in the text? Why or why not?
5. It is clear that being silent about certain things—children being segregated
away from peers who are native speakers of English and thus models for
learning English; children not receiving school content instruction to
keep up with other students in a school; children not gaining literacy in
their native language or learning more than one language—is one device
to enhance building the importance of an English only policy in the two
earlier policy excerpts. If readers do not think of what is unsaid, the two
excerpts sound more convincing and “natural” than they otherwise
would. The issue here is not what viewpoint you should have on bilingual
education or English only. The issue is how you can defend your views in
fair and convincing ways. Write a short policy statement about language
learning policy or goals for immigrant children that is not silent on the
issues we have just mentioned. How has your text used language to build
a viewpoint on languages and aspects of language (e.g., literacy) in the
world as social goods?
Grammar Interlude #9: Topic Flow or Topic Chaining
Earlier, we discussed subjects, topics, and themes, as well as cohesion. Now
we take up topic-comment structure and topic chaining. People do not just
introduce a topic in a single sentence and then drop it. They usually continue
to talk about the same topic for a while. Further, when they switch topics they
must signal this in some way.
When one speaker speaks after another, the second speaker usually has to
either continue talking about the same topic as the first speaker or at least tie
or relate to that topic in some way before introducing a new topic. When one
speaker or a second speaker continues to talk about the same topic, we will
say that they are speaking “on topic.” When they switch topics but try in some
fashion to relate the new topic to the old, we will say they are speaking
“topically.”
English clauses and sentences usually have a topic-comment structure. The
subject is normally in first position which makes it both topic and theme (if
something is in front of the subject, then that is the theme and the subject is 
Building Things in the World 149
just the topic). What follows the subject is the comment, what is being said
about it. Normally the subject/topic is old information, that is, information
that has already been talked about or is assumed by the speaker to be known
already to the listener. Normally the comment is, or at least contains, new
information, information that moves the communication along and that is not
already known or assumed to be known by the listener. As we pointed out in
Grammar Interlude #3 on intonation, where in a clause the major pitch change
(which demarcates the focus of the clause) is placed determines what
constitutes the new information and this is usually some place in the comment.
Of course, some subject/topics are new information when we start a new topic.
If we continue talking about it, it is thereafter old information. So I could say “A
unicorn is in the garden. It is really beautiful.” Here “a unicorn” is a new topic and
new information (in fact, everything in the sentence is new information), and “it”
continues talking about it and is old and assumed information.
A structure like “There is a unicorn in the garden” has a “dummy subject” (a
meaningless subject) and shifts the old subject (“a unicorn”) towards the back
of the sentence. This is a way of introducing and emphasizing topics that are
new information. Structures like “It is clear that John lied” do a similar thing.
This could be said as “That John lied is clear,” but here the subject/topic (“that
John lied”) is heavy and a lot of new information for subject position. So English
can move it towards the back of the sentence where new information more
normally occurs. We can call these structures (“There is a unicorn in the
garden,” “It is clear that John lied”) topic shifted structures, since the normal
subject/topic is not in first position but shifted towards the back of the sentence.
Consider the written passage below. This is from a paper written by a
Mexican-American academic about a controversy that arose in a court of law as
to whether a burrito was a sandwich or not (Richard Ruiz, “The ontological
status of burritos,” 2008, unpublished paper, University of Arizona, Tuscan,
Arizona). I have numbered each sentence and placed material on different lines
to make the data easier to read. I have capitalized and underlined the subject/
topics of main clauses. These are the most prominent topics in a communication.
I have bolded the subject/topics of embedded and subordinate clauses. These
are less prominent topics, sort of sub-topics. There are three cases (in 2, 5, and
6) where heavy subject/topics with lots of new information have been shifted.
First Paragraph:
1. A few months ago, A JUDGE IN MASSACHUSETTS declared that a burrito
was not a sandwich.
2. It is not clear WHAT HIS CREDENTIALS WERE TO MAKE THIS DECISION.
3. HIS NAME does not lead me to conclude that he had the kind of intimate
personal experience with Mexican food that I and many others like me have
had, although I fully acknowledge that names are not a good way to
determine national origin 
 150 Building Things in the World
4. (I went to school with a Mexican-American named Plunkett and I work with
a Puerto Rican who counts Schwartzkopf as one of his family names.)
5. THE JUDGE’S DECISION was explicitly legal, but IT still brings us to question
what social and cultural considerations might have gone into this determination.
Paragraph 2:
6. It is not new THAT JUDGES AND COURTS DECIDE QUESTIONS FOR
WHICH THEIR BACKGROUND MAY BE DEEMED INADEQUATE.
7. SOME OF THESE DECISIONS are much more important than resolving the
ontological status of burritos.
8. In 1896, A COURT decided that a law requiring Black and White people to
use separate public facilities was constitutional.
9. THE PLAINTIFF was Homer Plessy, a man who was one-eighth Black.
The first paragraph starts with the topic “a judge in Massachusetts.” The
indefinite article “a” tells us this topic is new information and not already
assumed known (if it were already assumed known, the author would have
said “The judge in Massachusetts). The second sentence has a dummy subject,
the word “it” and shifts the subject “what his credentials were to make this
decision” towards the back of the sentence. “His credentials” is the subject/
topic of this embedded clause (the clause is itself a shifted subject). In “his
credentials,” “his” refers back to “a judge in Massachusetts.” Sentence (3) has
the topic “his name,” with “his” once again linking back to the judge. So we
get the chain: “a judge in Massachusetts”  “his credentials”  “his name,”
all of which are about the judge. This chain of topics all referring to the judge
creates a coherent sense that the paragraph so far is about one thing.
The shifted subject structure in (2) is a way to introduce “what his
credentials were to make this decision” as both a topic and important new
information. In fact, it is the central idea around which the whole paragraph
turns. The paragraph is about the judge’s lack of cultural credentials and the
fact that the author does have such credentials.
Then we get an aside, placed in parentheses in sentence (4). Here we have a
two conjoined clauses (both main clauses, then), both of which have the topic
“I.” These two “I” topics follow a number of mentions of the author himself in
the preceding sentence. In fact, we get a run of “I” subjects in subordinated or
embedded clauses preceding the conjoined clauses in (4), which constitutes “I”
as a sort of sub-topic in this paragraph. And, indeed, the author is trying to try
a comparison and contrast between the judge and himself:
… that I and many others like me have had
although I fully acknowledge
that names are not
a good way to determine national origin
(I went to school with a Mexican-American named Plunkett
and I work with a Puerto Rican who counts Schwartzkopf as one of his family names). 
Building Things in the World 151
(5) is another sentence made up of two conjoined clauses. The topic of the
first conjoined clause is “the judge’s decision” and the topic of the second is
the pronoun “it” referring to the judge’s decision. So, after the aside we
return to the judge as the overall topic of the paragraph. The embedded
topic “social and cultural considerations” in (5), which is new information,
introduces in a subordinated way a topic that will become prominent later
in the essay.
In this first paragraph the author is saying things about the judge that
question his credentials, especially his cultural credentials. A sub-theme in
the paragraph is about the author himself (“I”). About himself, the author says
things that make clear his own cultural credentials as a Mexican-American,
but one with sophistication about culture in a cosmopolitan country like the
United States. He thus, juxtaposes his cultural competence against his
suspicion of the judge’s lack of such competence.
In the second paragraph the author wants to change topics away from the
judge to a list of court decisions. He does this by using a shifted subject
structure: “It is not new THAT JUDGES AND COURTS DECIDE QUESTIONS
FOR WHICH THEIR BACKGROUND MAY BE DEEMED INADEQUATE.”
This allows him to introduce the embedded clause “that judges and courts
decide questions for which their background may be deemed inadequate” as
an important topic and new information. In fact, it is the topic of the next
paragraph as a whole. The subject/topic of this embedded clause (“judges and
courts”) links back to the topic of the first paragraph (the judge) and, thus,
speaks topically.
In sentence (7) the subject/topic is “some of these decisions,” which links
back to “that judges and courts decide questions for which their background
may be deemed inadequate” via the “decide”/”decisions” relationship. The
author then lists several decisions (I quote only one) where courts made
culturally insensitive decisions of much greater consequence than the decision
about burritos. The topics of sentence (8)—“court”—and (9)—“plaintiff”—
are terms that link back to “some of these decisions,” since legal decisions
involve courts and plaintiffs. So, again, we get a chain of topics that give
coherence and unity to the paragraph.
The author both controls topic flow—or chains topics—and introduces
topics that are new information in lucid ways that help focus and guide the
attention of his reader. It should be clear, too, that topic chaining or topic flow
is a form of creating cohesion and, in turn, uses several of the cohesive devices
we discussed in Grammar Interlude #8. Topic chaining ties sentences together
across an oral or written text and helps listeners organize information in their
minds.
In doing a discourse analysis it is always a good idea to map topics as I have
done, since topic flow or topic chaining is one key way speakers and writers
create a perspective and seek to control their listeners and readers attention.
This allows us to introduce another grammatical tool:
 152 Building Things in the World
Tool #22: The Topic Flow or Topic Chaining Tool
For any communication, ask what the topics are of all main clauses and how
these topics are linked to each other to create (or not) a chain that creates an
overall topic or coherent sense of being about something for a stretch of speech
or writing. Topics in subordinated and embedded clauses represent less
prominent topics that are subordinated to the main chain of topics in main
clauses, but it is useful to ask how they relate to the main chain of topics. Ask,
as well, how people have signaled that they are switching topics and whether
they have “spoken topically” by linking back to the old topic in some first. Look,
as well, for topic shifted structures and how they are being used.
Problem 35
Below is data from the history project we have discussed several times before.
You saw this data before in Section 3.17. Karen, Jane (teachers), and Joe (an
administrator) work in the Middleview schools. They were born in Middleview
and they intend to stay there and want their children to stay there. Sara is a
university professor not born in Middleview (or the state it is in) and not
intending to stay there (and she eventually moved to another university to
advance her career).
How are topics and topic chaining working in this conversation? How do
topics and topic chaining work here to communicate a sense of identity? How
are topic shifted structures being used? Does Sara speak topically (i.e., tie
back to the topic being talked before or while introducing a new topic)? Does
Jane in her last contribution speak topically by linking back to Sara’s topic?
How so?
I have capitalized and underlined the subject/topics of each idea unit (tone
unit). I have not here considered the topics of subordinate and embedded
structures that are not tone units by themselves, nor made a distinction
between tone units that are main clauses and ones that are not. (13) and (14)
make up a complex shifted subject structure (“it was …” is a colloquial version
of “there was …”). (23) is another shifted subject structure. In two cases, I
have placed information in brackets that was not said but which is understood:
KAREN:
1. MY MOTHER used to talk about in the 40s /
2. YOU’d hang around at Union Station/
3. And ANYBODY would just pick you up /

4.1 Six Theoretical Tools
We turn now to six tools that are centered in different theories (core ideas)
about how language ties to the world and to culture. First, we will draw on a
theory from cognitive psychology about how meaning works. We will
introduce the notion of “situated meanings” and argue that we humans
actively build meanings “live on line” when we use language in specific
contexts.
Second, we will draw on a theory from sociolinguistics about how different
styles or varieties of using language work to allow humans to carry out
different types of social work and enact different socially significant, sociallysituated identities. We will introduce the notion of “social languages” and
argue that any language (like English or Russian) is composed of a great many
different social languages. Each of these is connected to meanings and
activities associated with particular social and cultural groups.
Third we will draw on theories from literary criticism to introduce the
notion of “intertextuality.” When anyone speaks or writes they often make
reference to what other people or various texts (like the Bible) or media (like
movies) have said or meant. They may quote or just allude to what others
have said. This means that one “text” (where the word here means any stretch
of spoken or written language) refers to or points to another “text” (words
from what others have said or written). Thus, if I say “Even though life is
sweet sorrow, I prefer it to the alternative,” I am alluding to (for those in the
know) Shakespeare’s quote that “love is such sweet sorrow” and mixing these
words from Shakespeare into my “text.” Plagiarism is, of course, an extreme
and “stealth” version of such “intertextual” references (that is, references,
quotations, or allusions in one text to another text).
Fourth, we will draw on a theory from psychological anthropology about
how humans form and use theories to give language meaning and understand
each other and the world. Here we will introduce the notion of “figured
worlds.” Figured worlds are narratives and images different social and cultural
groups of people use to make sense of the world. They function as simplified
models of how things work when they are “normal” and “natural” from the
perspective of a particular social and cultural group. They are meant to help
people get on with the business of living and communicating without having
to explicitly reflect in everything before acting.
Fifth, we will draw on theories from a variety of areas (cultural anthropology,
cultural psychology, sociolinguistics, and philosophy) about how meaning
goes well beyond human minds and language to involve objects, tools,
technologies, and networks of people collaborating with each other. Here we
will introduce the notion of “Discourses” with a capital “D” (so-called “big ‘D’
Discourses”). Discourses are ways of enacting and recognizing different sorts
of socially situated and significant identities through the use of language
integrated with characteristic ways of acting, interacting, believing, valuing, 
 Theoretical Tools 157
and using various sorts of objects (including our bodies), tools, and
technologies in concert with other people.
Finally, we will draw on history and the nature of public debates and social
change. Here we will introduce the notion of “Conversations” with a capital
“C” (so-called “big ‘C’ Conversations”). It is not just people that have
conversations with each other. Discourses—historically different kinds of
people enacting and recognizing different socially significant identities—use
people, texts, and media to carry on historically significant Conversations
(debates) among different themselves. Often when I talk as a professor, a
(video) gamer, an environmentalist (a “green”), or as a Baby Boomer what I
say relates to, assumes, and contributes to relatively widely known and
recognized historically evolving topics, issues, debates, controversies, and
different sides in debates.
4.2 The Situated Meaning Tool
Meaning is a very complicated concept. One important distinction we can
make is between the general meaning a word or utterance has (sometimes
called “utterance type meaning”) and the specific meaning a word or utterance
takes on in a specific context of use (sometimes called “utterance token
meaning”).
When we interpret any piece of language we have general expectations about
how our language is normally used. Another way to put this is to say that any
word or structure in language has a certain “meaning potential,” that is, a
range of possible meanings that the word or structure can take on in different
contexts of use. Thus, for example, the word “cat” has to do, broadly, with the
felines; the (syntactic) structure “subject of a sentence” has to do, broadly,
with naming a “topic” in the sense of “what is being talked about.” This is
general meaning (utterance-type meaning.) Such meanings are connected to
the prototypical situations in which a word or structure is usually used.
Such general meanings are what word definitions in dictionaries try to
capture. For example, a definition of “cat” might be something like:
1 a : a carnivorous mammal (Felis catus) long domesticated as a pet and for
catching rats and mice b : any of a family (Felidae) of carnivorous usually solitary
and nocturnal mammals (as the domestic cat, lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, cougar,
wildcat, lynx, and cheetah) [Retrieved September 24, 2009 from www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/cat]
No one knows exactly how definitions work in our heads, though psychologists
and linguists have long studied the matter. Definitions like the one above are
certainly not typical of what is in heads. Few people know cats are classified
as “Felis catus” and not everyone knows cats are carnivorous (or what
“carnivorous” really means, i.e., that cats cannot survive with meat, not just 
 158 Theoretical Tools
that they happen to eat or like meat). What is in our heads is probably a
combination of the following things: images or prototypes of what is typical of
the things the word refers to; information and facts we know (but which not
all of us share exactly); and typical uses of the word and the typical range of
contexts in which the word is normally used.
In any case, we will just talk about “general meanings,” meaning by this the
range of typical meanings a word (or structure) has. This is the “meaning
potential” of the word or the “meaning resources” it represents. Such meaning
potential or meaning resources can, of course, change as we hear the word
used in more contexts or as people change how they use the word.
In actual situations of use, words and structures take on much more specific
meanings within the range of (or, at least, related to the range of) their
meaning potentials. This is what I will call “situated meaning.” Thus, in a
situation where we are discussing species of animals and say something like
“The world’s big cats are all endangered,” “cat” means things like lions and
tigers; in a situation where we are discussing mythology and say something
like “The cat was a sacred symbol to the ancient Egyptians,” “cat” means real
and pictured cats as symbols; and in a situation where we are discussing
breakable decorative objects on our mantel and say something like “The cat
broke,” “cat” means a statue of cat.
Turning to structures, rather than words: while the subjects of sentences
are always “topic-like” (this is their general meaning), in different situations
of use, subjects take on a range of more specific meanings. In a debate, if I say,
“The constitution only protects the rich,” the subject of the sentence (“the
constitution”) is an entity about which a claim is being made; if a friend of
yours has just arrived and I usher her in saying “Mary’s here,” the subject of
the sentence (“Mary”) is a center of interest or attention; and in a situation
where I am commiserating with a friend and say something like “You really
got cheated by that guy,” the subject of the sentence (“you”) is a center of
empathy (signaled also by the fact that the normal subject of the active version
of the sentence—“That guy really cheated you”—has been “demoted” from
subject position through use of the “get-passive”).
So words do not have just general meanings. They have different and
specific meanings in different contexts in which they are used and in different
specialist domains that recruit them. This is true of the most mundane cases.
For instance, notice the change in meaning in the word “coffee” in the
following utterances which refer to different situations: “The coffee spilled, go
get the mop” (coffee as liquid), “The coffee spilled, go get a broom” (coffee as
grains), “The coffee spilled, stack it again” (coffee in cans). Or notice the quite
different meanings of the word “work” in everyday life and in physics (e.g., I
can say, in everyday life, that I worked hard to push the car, but if my efforts
didn’t move the car, I did no “work” in the physics sense of the word).
In actual contexts, people do not just look up the meanings of words in
their heads, like a dictionary. They know the possible range of the meanings 
 Theoretical Tools 159
of a word, but they also know this can change with new uses. People must in
context actively “make up” (guess) the meanings of the words and phrases
they hear. Often this is fairly routine, since they have heard meanings like this
before. But sometimes they must do more work and actively seek to ask what
people must mean here and now if they have said what they said in the context
in which they have said it.
For example, if someone says “The cat is floating away,” in some contexts
they may be referring to a “cat-shaped cloud.” The phrase “things you would
save first from your house in a fire” will mean different specific things to
different people in different contexts (e.g., would you take your cat or your
expensive painting?). To know what it means to you, you have to think about
what meaning you would give it in the context of a fire and your own life.
What does someone mean in the context of current political debates in the
United States by the word “democracy” if they say: “The United States will not
really be a democracy until we have real campaign finance reform.”
So we can introduce the first of our four theoretical tools, the Situated
Meaning Tool:
Tool #23: The Situated Meaning Tool
For any communication, ask of words and phrases what situated meanings they
have. That is, what specific meanings do listeners have to attribute to these
words and phrases given the context and how the context is construed?
The Situated Meaning Tool is obviously closely related to the Filling In Tool.
It is part of what we fill in from context. But it is a particularly crucial part of
the filling in process. Words and phrases in actual contexts of use do not
always have clear dictionary like meanings. Listeners have to figure out—
guess—what they mean based on what else has been said and other aspects of
the context. So do we discourse analysts. Meaning making is not a “look up”
process. It is an active process.
There is one important aspect of situated meaning to keep in mind. One
way we as listeners situate the meanings of words and phrases is to use our
previous experience of—and knowledge of—what is being talked about.
Speakers have to make assumptions about what sorts of experience and
knowledge are shared or shared enough with others to communicate. If you
have never heard about campaign finance reform and know nothing about
U.S. politics, then you cannot situate a meaning for “democracy” in an
utterance like “The United States will not really be a democracy until we have
real campaign finance reform.”
All utterances make assumptions about people’s previous experiences and
knowledge. They assume certain experiences and knowledge in order to be
understood. In that sense, any utterance, in terms of how it is formulated, 
 160 Theoretical Tools
makes assumptions about the “kind of person” who is an “appropriate” or
“acceptable” listener (and maybe even person). We will see this aspect of
language more when we discuss figured worlds and Discourses below.
4.3 Working with the Situated Meaning Tool
The Situated Meaning Tool tells us to ask what words and phrases mean in
specific contexts. In many cases, the meanings of words and phrases in
context are clear and well within the normal and routine range of meanings
these words and phrases typically have. But this is not always the case and
we want to be on the watch for cases where words and phrases are being
given situated meanings that are nuanced and quite specific to the speaker’s
worldview or values or to the special qualities of the context the speaker is
assuming and helping to construe or create (remember the reflexive property
of context).
In this section we will look at cases where the Situated Meaning Tool applies
in important ways.
Problem 36
A typical dictionary definition of “democracy” is “government by the people;
a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and
exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral
system” (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/democracy). This definition
captures pretty well what we have called the general meaning of the word
“democracy.” However, a word like “democracy” is what we might call a
“contested word.” People argue a good bit about what political systems
“really” deserve to be called a “democracy.” People use the word with specific
nuances of meaning that reflect their viewpoints and values.
Consider the quotes below. Each uses the word “democracy.” First, ask
yourself how the definition of democracy, its general meaning, does or does
not fit with the way the word is being used in the quote. Then specify what
situated meaning the word has in each quote (what additional meanings,
connotations, and nuances the word is being given). What does each author
mean in specific terms by the word? Finally, what does the way the author has
used the word “democracy” tell you about his or her value system and political
viewpoint? The quote in (4) is from a ruling of the Israeli Supreme Court. In
(3) you want to analyze what Penalosa has to say about “democracy.”
1. … yet I believe [Milton] Friedman is right that thoroughgoing restrictions
on economic freedom would turn out to be inconsistent with democracy
(Retrieved Sept. 24, 2009 from www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/
2006/11/on_milton_fried.html).
 Theoretical Tools 161
2. If democracy is about creating processes that allow people to empower
themselves, then pirates [people running illegal pirate radio channels] are
clearly the perfect catalyst for such processes (Mason, M., 2008, The
pirate’s dilemma: How youth culture is reinventing capitalism. New York:
Free Press, p. 47).
3. Penalosa [Mayor of Bogota, Columbia] observes that “high quality public
pedestrian space in general and parks in particular are evidence of true
democracy at work” (Brown, L. R., 2008, Plan B 3.0: Mobilizing to save
civilization. Revised and Expanded Edition. Washington, DC: Earth
Policy Institute, p. 193).
4. That is the fate of democracy, in whose eyes not all means are permitted,
and to whom not all the methods used by her enemies are open (The
Public Committee Against Torture in Israel v The State of Israel, cited in
Weisberg, J., 2008, The Bush tragedy. New York: Random House.
pp. 181–82).
Problem 37
In the state of Arizona in the United States, immigrant children take a test of
their English proficiency. Based on their scores they are put into classes that
meet four hours every day where they are taught English language skills
only in English. The teacher below teaches children classified as “4” by the
test. If a child does better than 4 they are consider proficient in English and
do not need to take the four-hour English language classes. Read the
teacher’s quote and say what you think her situated meaning for “gifted” is.
Why is the teacher using hedges like “pretty” in “pretty advanced,” “pretty
gifted,” “pretty high” and “per se” in “don’t have gifted kids per se”? This
teacher can be seen as creating a situated meaning for “fours.” What is it?
Can one tell whether a child is “gifted” or not by how well they speak a
language they don’t yet fully know? Do all “gifted” people learn second
languages quickly? How are the situated meanings this teacher is creating
for “gifted,” “pretty gifted,” “pretty high,” and “fours” related to an implicit
contrast she is drawing to kids who scored lower on the test (and, thus,
aren’t in her classroom)?
They’re fours. So they’re pretty advanced actually. They’re pretty gifted, not
gifted. I don’t have any gifted kids per se, but I think they’re pretty high. Like
just when we were sorting out the whole second grade, they’re pretty high. They
have a lot of their basic phonics and they’ve been reading their books pretty well
in the second grade text. [Data from: Heineke, A. J. (2009). Teacher’s discourse

 162 Theoretical Tools
4.4 The Social Languages Tool
People do not speak any language “in general.” They always speak a specific
variety of a language (which might actually mix together more than one
language, e.g., English and Spanish) and they use different varieties in different
contexts. There are social and regional varieties of language that are called
“dialects” (see Section 1.1), such as African-American Vernacular English,
Appalachian Vernacular English, or different working class varieties of English
in different parts of the United States. However, we are going to concentrate
here on what I will call “social languages” (many linguists use the term
“register” in a somewhat similar way).
To understand what a speaker says, a listener needs to know who is
speaking. But it is not enough to know, for example, that Mary Smith is the
speaker. I need to know what identity Mary is speaking out of. Is she speaking
to me as a teacher, a feminist, a friend, a colleague, an avid bird watcher, a
political liberal, or a great many other possible identities or roles?
Listeners need to know who speakers are. Is my doctor saying I look
“stressed” just as a friend or is he speaking as a doctor? When the policeman
says “I think you should move your car” is she speaking as a policeman and
ordering me to move the car or speaking as a helpful fellow citizen giving me
advice?
I will define social languages as styles or varieties of a language (or a mixture
of languages) that enact and are associated with a particular social identity. All
languages, like English or French, are composed of many (a great many)
different social languages. Social languages are what we learn and what we
speak. Here are some examples of social languages: the language of medicine,
literature, street gangs, sociology, law, rap, or informal dinner-time talk
among friends.
Even within these large categories there are sub-varieties. Not all types of
gangs or sociologists speak the same when they are speaking as gang members
or sociologists. To know any specific social language is to know how its
characteristic lexical and grammatical resources are combined to enact specific
socially-situated identities (that is, being, at a given time and place, a lawyer,
a gang member, a politician, a literary humanist, a bench chemist, a radical
feminist, an everyday person, or whatever). To know a particular social
language is either to be able to “do” a particular identity or to be able to
recognize such an identity, when we do not want to or cannot actively
participate.
Dialects can be seen as social languages as well. Southern English is a way
to mark oneself as a southerner. African-American Vernacular English is a
way to mark oneself as an African-American of a certain sort (at a certain time
and place).
Let me give two examples, both of which we have seen earlier. First, a
young woman, telling the same story to her parents and to her boyfriend, says 
 Theoretical Tools 163
to her parents at dinner: “Well, when I thought about it, I don’t know, it
seemed to me that Gregory should be considered the most offensive character,”
but later to her boyfriend she says: “What an ass that guy was, you know, her
boyfriend.” In the first case, she uses distinctive lexical and grammatical
resources to enact “a dutiful and intelligent daughter having dinner with her
proud parents” and in the other case to enact “a girlfriend being intimate with
her boyfriend.”
Note, by the way, that the particular labels I use here are not important.
Many social languages have no names and names need not be used by people
overtly. People who use a given social language may differ on what they call
it. The point just is that people must have some, however tentative, unspoken,
and sometimes problematic, idea of who is speaking in the sense of what
social identity is at play.
Second, to take an example from Myers 1990 book Writing Biology: Texts in
the social construction of scientific knowledge, an example which we saw in
Sections 3.16 and 3.17, a biologist writing in a professional science journal
writes: “Experiments show that Heliconius butterflies are less likely to oviposit
on host plants that possess eggs or egg-like structures”; writing about the
same thing in a popular science magazine, the same biologist writes:
“Heliconius butterflies lay their eggs on Passiflora vines.” The first passage
uses distinctive lexical and grammatical resources to enact “a professional
adaptationist biologist of a certain type engaged in managing uncertainty
through the manipulation of theory and experiment”; the second passage uses
distinctive lexical and grammatical resources to enact “a highly trained
observer looking at animals and plants in nature.”
Within any social language, as the speaker acts out a particular type of
who—a particular socially-situated identity—the speaker must also make
clear what he or she is doing, what action or activity, appropriate to that
identity, he or she is carrying out. Listeners need to know not only who is
talking but what they are seeking to accomplish. So speakers always use social
languages to enact specific actions or activities as well.
For example, a listener needs to know if a doctor who says “Have you been
stressed lately” is asking a diagnostic question as a doctor or showing concern
(or even just making “small talk”) as a friend. If a policeman says “I think you
should move your car” I need to know if she is giving me a polite but official
order or just offering helpful advice as a fellow but well informed citizen. If a
professor asks a student “What does ‘democracy’ mean?,” the student needs to
know if this is “test” (and the answer has to be the one the professor thinks is
correct) or a request for an considered opinion that might further class
discussion. We need to know both who is speaking and what they are doing.
Each social language has its own distinctive grammar. However, two
different sorts of grammars are important to social languages, only one of
which we ever think to study formally in school. One grammar is the traditional
set of units like nouns, verbs, inflections, phrases and clauses. These are real 
 164 Theoretical Tools
enough, though quite inadequately described in traditional school grammars.
Let’s call this “grammar 1.”
The other—less studied, but more important—grammar is the “rules” by
which grammatical units like nouns and verbs, phrases and clauses, are used
to create patterns which signal or “index” characteristic social identities and
social activities. That is, we speakers and writers design our oral or written
utterances to have patterns in them in virtue of which interpreters can attribute
situated identities and specific activities to us and our utterances. We will call
this “grammar 2.”
These patterns are called “collocational patterns.” This means that various
sorts of grammatical devices “co-locate” with each other. The patterns I am
trying to name here are “co-relations” (correlations) among many grammatical
devices, from different “levels” of grammar 1. For example, in Jane’s utterance
to her boyfriend, “What an ass that guy was, you know, her boyfriend,” note
how informal terms like “ass” and “guy,” the vague reference “that guy,” the
informal parenthetical device “you know,” and the informal syntactic device
of “right dislocation” (i.e., letting the phrase “her boyfriend” hang out at the
end of the sentence) all pattern together to signal that this utterance is in an
informal social language used to achieve solidarity.
The situation here is much like choosing clothes that go together in such a
way that they communicate that we are engaged in a certain activity or are
taking up a certain style connected to such activities. For example, consider
how flip-flops, bathing suit, tank top, shades, and sun hat “co-locate” together
to “signal” to us things like outdoor and water activities and the situated
identities we take up in such situations.
To see another example of how different word choices and grammatical
structures pattern together to signal a given social language, consider the two
sentences below:
1. Hornworms sure vary a lot in how well they grow.
2. Hornworm growth displays a significant amount of variation.
The first sentence is a vernacular style of language, a vernacular social
language. Everyone who is a native speaker of English, regardless of their
dialect, can utter some equally good variant of this sort of sentence (if they
know what hornworms are—green caterpillar-like creatures with yellow
horns).
The second sentence is in an academic social language. While every native
speaker’s grammar contains all the grammatical structures that this sentence
contains (e.g., nominalizations), not every speaker knows that combining them
in just this way is called for by certain social practices of certain academic (and
school-based) domains (what we will later call “Discourses”). This has to be
learned and this knowledge is not acquired on the basis of any biological
capacity for language, as is our knowledge of the vernacular. It is manifestly 
 Theoretical Tools 165
the case that many children in school struggle to acquire forms of language
like that in sentence 2, though none (if they are native speakers) struggle with
the forms of language like that in sentence 1.
Again, every native speaker of English has a grammar that contains all of
the sorts of grammatical structures that are used in sentence 2. All of them are
used at times in vernacular forms of language. However, to produce a sentence
like 2 you must know more than this. You must know that, in this style of
language, verbs naming dynamic processes (e.g., “grow” and “vary”) are often
turned into nouns naming abstract things (e.g., “growth” and “variation”).
You have to know that in this form of language emotive markers like “sure”
are not used. You have to know that in this form of language a vague phrase
like “a lot” must be replaced by a more explicit one like “significant variation”
(where “significant” has a fairly precise definition in areas like biology). You
have to know that subjects of sentences in this form of language will very
often not be simple nouns (like “hornworms”), but nominalizations (like
“hornworm growth”) expressing a whole clause worth of information (i.e.,
hornworms grow) as an abstract concept. And most importantly you have to
know all these things together and that these linguistic features, in fact, tend to go
together—to pattern together—in this form of language.
The term “social language” applies to specific varieties of language used to
enact specific identities and carry out specific sorts of practices or activities. A
single written or oral text can be in one social language or it can switch
between two or more or even mix them up pretty thoroughly.
For example, consider the warning on an aspirin bottle that you saw in
Section 3.7:
Warnings: Children and teenagers should not use this medication for chicken pox or
flu symptoms before a doctor is consulted about Reye Syndrome, a rare but serious
illness reported to be associated with aspirin. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach
of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact
a poison control center immediately. As with any drug, if you are pregnant or
nursing a baby, seek the advice of a health professional before using this product.
IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT NOT TO USE ASPIRIN DURING THE LAST 3
MONTHS OF PREGNANCY UNLESS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED TO DO SO BY
A DOCTOR BECAUSE IT MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS IN THE UNBORN CHILD
OR COMPLICATIONS DURING DELIVERY. See carton for arthritis use+ and
Important Notice.
There are two different social languages or varieties of language in this
warning. The first is made up of the following sentences:
Children and teenagers should not use this medication for chicken pox or flu symptoms
before a doctor is consulted about Reye Syndrome, a rare but serious illness reported to
be associated with aspirin. IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT NOT TO USE ASPIRIN
DURING THE LAST 3 MONTHS OF PREGNANCY UNLESS SPECIFICALLY 
 166 Theoretical Tools
DIRECTED TO DO SO BY A DOCTOR BECAUSE IT MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS IN
THE UNBORN CHILD OR COMPLICATIONS DURING DELIVERY.
Here things are referred to quite specifically (“children or teenagers,” “this
medication,” “chicken pox,” “flu,” “Reye Syndrome,” “aspirin,” “last 3
months,” “unborn child,” “delivery”), doctors are called “doctor,” and matters
are treated emphatically (italics, capitals, “should not,” “rare but serious,”
“especially important,” “specifically directed”).
The second social language is made up of the following sentences, placed in
the middle of the other two:
Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose,
seek professional assistance or contact a poison control center immediately. As
with any drug, if you are pregnant or nursing a baby, seek the advice of a health
professional before using this product.
Here things are referred to more generally and generically (“this and all
drugs,” “any drug,” and “this product,” rather than “this medication” and
“aspirin”; “children” rather than “children and teenagers,” “pregnant” rather
than “last 3 months of pregnancy”), doctors are not mentioned, rather the
health profession is referred to more generally (“professional assistance,”
“poison control center,” “health professional”), and matters are treated less
stridently with the exception of the word “immediately” (here we get small
print and the less strident phrases “keep out of reach,” “accidental overdose,”
“seek ... assistance,” “seek advice,” rather than the more direct “should not”
and “important not to use” of the other part of the warning).
These two social language “feel” different. They are authorized and issued
by different “voices” to different purposes and effects. The first speaks with a
lawyerly voice responding to specific potential legal problems and court cases;
the second speaks with the official voice of a caring, but authoritatively
knowledgeable company trying to protect and advise people, especially
women and children, while still stressing that aspirin is not particularly special
or dangerous compared to drugs in general.
Of course, this second social language sits in some tension with the first. By
the way, the second social language on the aspirin bottle used to be the only
warning on the bottle (with the order of the sentences a bit different). And,
indeed, the warning has changed yet again on newer bottles.
This warning, like all utterances, reflects the company it has kept, or, to put
the matter another way, it reflects a history that has given rise to it. In this
case, presumably, the new sterner, more direct social language was added to
the more general and avuncular one because the company got sued over things
like Reye’s syndrome.
The warning on the aspirin bottle is heteroglossic. That is, it is “doublevoiced,” since it interleaves two different social languages together. Of course, 
 Theoretical Tools 167
in different cases, this sort of interleaving could be much more intricate, with
the two (or more) social languages more fully integrated, and harder to tease
apart.
We can now state the second of our theoretical tools, The Social Languages
Tool:
Tool #24: Social Languages Tool:
For any communication, ask how it uses words and grammatical structures
(types of phrases, clauses, and sentences) to signal and enact a given social
language. The communication may mix two or more social languages or switch
between two or more. In turn, a social language may be composed of words or
phrases from more than one language (e.g., it may mix English and Spanish).

4.5 Working with the Social Languages Tool
Problem 38
The text below is from a published article in a journal on child development.
Read it and think about how what sort of social language and identity this text
represents.
The present study sought to clarify and extend previous work suggesting that
physically abused children develop perceptual sensitivity to anger. First, we sought
to further examine the ways in which physically abused children can regulate
attentional processes when confronted with anger or threat. Second, because prior
research suggested that physically abused children would be especially sensitive to
anger, the anger-related stimuli presented to the children occurred in the background
and were irrelevant to the child’s purported task and not personally meaningful.
This created a relatively conservative test of children’s attentional regulation. The
present data suggest that once anger was introduced, abused children maintained a 
 168 Theoretical Tools
state of anticipatory monitoring of the environment. In contrast, non-abused
children were initially more aroused by the introduction of anger, but showed better
recovery to baseline states once anger was resolved. (Pollak, S. D., Vardi, S., Putzer
Bechner, A. M., and Curtin, J. J. (2005). Physically abused children’s regulation of
attention in response to hostility.” Child Development 76.5: 968–77—see p. 974)
Questions:
1. List some of the features in terms of word choice, grammatical structures, and
patterns of grammatical structures that make this a distinctive social language.
2. This type of language is often referred to as “academic language.”
However, there are many different varieties of academic language (e.g.,
physics, sociology, linguistics, etc.). How would you characterize the
academic area this social language is connected to?
3. What is the situated meaning of the phrase “not purposefully meaningful”
in the text? Are their senses (situated meanings) of “personally
meaningful” in which anger, even if not expressed directly at them, could
be “personally meaningful” to a child who has been physically abused by
angry parents (as were these children)?
4. How would you characterize the identity that the authors of this text are
enacting or expressing through this social language?
Problem 39
In Section 3.13 we looked at data from an interview with a middle-school
teacher. As we said earlier, this teaches lives in a town that is a former bluecollar industrial town that has lost a good deal of its industry and is in a poor
economic condition. There are not a lot of jobs and those that still do exist
often no longer carry good wages and medical benefits. Many of the parents in
the town—Black or Hispanic—work more than one job to make ends meet
and there is high unemployment.
The teacher was asked about whether she ever discussed social issues with
her students. A part of her response is reprinted below. In the transcript, “I”
stands for “Interviewer.” Words in brackets are guesses about what she said
when it cannot be well heard on the tape. “[????]” means material is inaudible.

Questions:
1. Much of the language of this data, at least in terms of word choice, is in the
teacher’s vernacular English. While some university academics who had been
interviewed in the same study often answered the questions in academic
forms of language or mixtures of academic language and the vernacular, this
teacher stays pretty close to the vernacular. Yet she uses a certain style of
speaking—uses patterns of words and grammar—that are pretty distinctive.
Her style is a form of “teacher talk” in this town. She and other teachers in
this town often used this style. So this is really not just her vernacular. How
would you characterize this social language—point to specific stylistic
features the teacher uses. What do you think the function of this style of
language is? What is the teacher trying to say and do by speaking this way?
2. The university academics we interviewed often based what they said on
the authority of their disciplines, which is why they often used academic
language in the interviews when they were asked social and political
questions. What is the source of the teacher’s authority for the things she
says in the communication above?
3. What is the situated meaning of “the low income things” in the
communication above?
4. How would you characterize the identity this teacher is enacting or
expressing through this social language?

4.6 The Intertextuality Tool
When we speak or write, we often quote or allude to what others have said.
Here I will use the word “text” in a special way to mean what someone has
said or written, a stretch of speech or writing. When one text (in this sense)
quotes, refers to, or alludes to another text (that is, what someone else has said
or written), we will call this “intertextuality.” We can expand this to cover
references or allusions to media (television, film, video games, etc.), treating
these as “texts” too.
There are obviously lots of ways one text can quote, refer to, or allude to
another one. One way is direct quotation as in “It’s funny that Bob said ‘I’ll
never give up’ and then gave up.” Another way is indirect quotation as in “It’s
funny that Bob said he would never give up and then gave up.” Yet another
way is just to allude what hearers or readers in the know will realize are words
taken from some other source as in “Even if life is sweet sorrow, I prefer it to
the alternative,” where “sweet sorrow” echoes a quote from Shakespeare:
“love is such sweet sorrow.” If I say that “When John fought with the boss, it
was David against Goliath,” the mere mention of David and Goliath is enough
(again, for people who know the reference) to make reference to the Biblical
story where the young David defeats the giant Goliath with his sling shot.
Here my speech (my “text”) has alluded to (made an intertextual reference to)
a Biblical text.
Another type of intertextuality occurs when a text written in one style (in
one social language associated with one identity) incorporates a style of
language (a social language) associated with a different identity. For example,
Wired magazine once printed a story with this title: “The New Face of the
Silicon Age: Tech jobs are fleeing to India faster than ever. You got a problem
with that?” (February 2004). The sentence “You got a problem with that?”
reminds us of “tough guy” talk we have heard in many movies or read in
books. It intrigues us that such talk occurs in a magazine devoted to technology
and otherwise written in popular culture high-tech magazine style.
Finally, one text can refer or allude to another text or style of language
(social language) by using or mimicking the grammar or phrasing, but not
necessarily the words, of another text or style of language. For example, I
could write a letter in Biblical sorts of prose or in iambic pentameter verse
thereby making reference to the Bible or traditional English poetry, but with
very different content.
 172 Theoretical Tools
Thus, we can state another tool for discourse analysis:
Tool #25: The Intertextuality Tool:
For any communication, ask how words and grammatical structures (e.g., direct
or indirect quotation) are used to quote, refer to, or allude to other “texts” (that
is, what others have said or written) or other styles of language (social
languages).

4.7 Working with the Intertextuality Tool
In this section you will work with the intertextuality tool. Here you will be
looking for any “echoes” of any sort in one text to another, whether these be
as direct as quotation or as indirect as allusion. You also want to ask how
intertextuality is used to engage in our various building tasks.
Problem 41
Consider the data below from an article about sports (the World Series in
baseball) on the internet (the author is talking about the New York Yankees
beating the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2009 World Series):
Sometimes Goliath wins, or, if you prefer the most appropriate analogy after
World Series Game 6, Godzilla kicks butt.
After years of seeing upstarts, hot teams and cursebreakers win the World Series
and playoff baseball reduced to “a crapshoot,” we got an old fashioned, the-bestteam-won World Series.

 Theoretical Tools 173
Questions:
1. Find and discuss all the intertextual references here. What is being
referred to? What function or role does each such reference play in the
data? [By the way “crapshoot” is in “scare quotes.” If you do not know
what scare quotes are, look it up. Why is “crapshoot” in scare quotes?
Some editors do not approve of scare quotes. Why do you think that is?]
2. Why does it seems sports reporting in newspapers and in other popular
media (e.g., television) is so prone to the sorts of intertextual references
in the data below?
3. If you do not follow baseball, sports, or U.S. sports, pair up with someone
who does and ask whether an “insider” gets more in terms of intertextual
references or what they mean or are doing in this data than does someone
who is an “outsider.”
4. Find other examples of intertextuality in sports writing or reporting. It
would be interesting to compare writing about different sports or about
sports in different countries in this regard.

how direct quotation works here as a form of intertextual reference. Why

differences would direct or indirect quotation make here?

4.8 The Figured Worlds Tool
Is the Pope a bachelor? Though the Pope is an unmarried man—and “bachelor”
as a word is defined as “an unmarried man”—we are reluctant to call the Pope
a bachelor. Why? The reason is that we do not use words just based on their
definitions or what we called earlier (see Section 4.2) their “general meanings.”
We use words based, as well, on stories, theories, or models in our minds
about what is “normal” or “typical.”
It is typical in our world that men marry women. A man who is somewhat
past the typical age when people marry we call a “bachelor,” assuming he is
open to marriage but has either chosen to wait or has not found the “right”
person. The Pope is both well past the normal age for marriage and has vowed
never to marry. He just does not fit the typical story in our heads.
We use words based on such typical stories unless something in the context
makes us think the situation is not typical. If the issue of gay marriage or the
chauvinism of calling men “bachelors” and women “spinsters” comes up, then
we have to think more overtly about matters and abandon, if only for the time,
our typical picture. Indeed, things can change in society enough that what
counts as a typical story changes or becomes contested. People may even stop
using words like “bachelor” based on the typical story and form a new typical
story—and, thus, start calling marriage-eligible women “bachelors” as well.
We use such typical pictures so that we can go on about the business of
communicating, acting, and living without having to consciously think about
everything—all the possible details and exceptions—all the time. This is good
for getting things done, but sometimes bad in the ways in which such typical 
 Theoretical Tools 175
stories can marginalize people and things that are not taken as “normal” or
“typical” in the story.
What counts as a typical story for people differs by their social and culture
groups. For example, some parents confronted by a demanding two-year-old
who angrily refuses to go to bed take the child’s behavior as sign of growth
towards autonomy because they accept a typical story like this: Children are
born dependent on their parents and then grow towards individual autonomy
or independence. On their way to autonomy, they act out, demanding
independence, when they may not yet be ready for it, but this is still a sign of
development and growth. Other parents confronted by the same behavior take
the behavior as a sign of the child’s willfulness because they accept a typical
story like this: Children are born selfish and need to be taught to think of
others and collaborate with the family rather than demand their own way.
It is, perhaps, not surprising that this latter typical story is more common
among working class families where mutual support among family and friends
is important. The former story is more common among middle and uppermiddle-class families with many more financial resources where people are
expected to grow into adults who have the resources to go it more on their
own.
Such typical stories are not “right” or “wrong.” For example, children are,
of course, born dependent on their parents. But are children primarily
inherently selfish and in need of being taught how to cooperate with others or
are they inherently reliant on caregivers and in need of learning to be
independent? The different stories we discussed are probably both true in
some sense, but one or the other can be stressed and help form the main
parenting style in the home. They are simplified theories of the world that are
meant to help people go on about the business of life when one is not allowed
the time to think through and research everything before acting. Even theories
in science are simplified views of the world meant to help scientists cope,
without having to deal with the full complexity of the world all at once.
These typical stories have been given many different names. They have
been called “folk theories,” “frames,” “scenarios,” “scripts,” “mental models,”
“cultural models,” “social models,” “discourse models,” and “figured worlds”
(and each of these terms has its own nuances). Such typical stories are stored
in our heads (but we will see in a moment that they are not always only in our
heads) in the form of images, metaphors, and narratives.
We will use the term “figured world” here for these typical stories. The term
“figured world” has been defined in Dorothy Holland’s influential 1998 book,
written with several colleagues, Identity and agency in cultural worlds, as
follows:
A socially and culturally constructed realm of interpretation in which particular
characters and actors are recognized, significance is assigned to certain acts, and
particular outcomes are valued over others. Each is a simplified world populated 
 176 Theoretical Tools
by a set of agents who engage in a limited range of meaningful acts or changes of
state as moved by a specific set of forces. (p. 52)
A figured world is a picture of a simplified world that captures what is taken
to be typical or normal. What is taken to be typical or normal, as we have said,
varies by context and by people’s social and cultural group (as we saw in the
example of acting out two-year-olds above). For example, if I ask you to
imagine a suburban bedroom you will populate the room with people and
things in a quite different way than if I ask you to imagine a bedroom in a
college dorm. You base what you take to be typical on your experiences and
since people’s experiences vary in terms of their social and cultural groups,
people vary in what they take to be typical. And, again, as society changes
what people take as typical can and does change. Figured worlds are not static.
To give another example, consider the figured world (or typical story) that
might arise in someone’s mind if they think about an elementary school
classroom: Typical participants include one teacher (a female) and a group of
kids of roughly the same age and some support staff including teachers who
help kids with special problems (e.g., learning disabilities, reading problems,
or who are learning English as a second language), sometimes by pulling them
out of the classroom. The kids are sitting in desks in rows facing the teacher,
who is doing most of the talking and sometimes asks the kids questions to
which she knows the answers. There are activities like filling our sheets of
paper with math problems on them. There are regular tests, some of them
state standardized tests. There is an institution surrounding the teacher that
includes a principal and other teachers as well as curriculum directors and
mandates from officials. Parents are quasi “outsiders” to this institution. There
are labels for individual kids, labels such as “SPED” (special education), “LD”
(learning disabled), and “ESL” (English as a Second Language).
This figured world—with its typical participants, activities, forms of
language, and object and environments—is, of course, realized in many actual
classrooms. However there are many exceptions, as well, but they do not
normally come to mind when we think and talk about schools. In fact, every
aspect of this figured world is heavily contested in one or more current school
reform efforts (e.g. age grading, lots of testing, skill sheets, too much teacher
talk, children in rows, etc.). The taken-for-granted nature of the figured world,
however, often stands in the way of change. Reforms just do not seem “normal”
or “right” or “the ways things should be.” For example, today it is not
uncommon that young children can teach adults things about digital
technology, but the child teaching and the teacher learning violates our typical
story. It also violates the values and structures of authority this typical story
incorporates.
I have said that these typical stories—what we are calling figured worlds—
are in our heads. But that is not strictly true. Often they are partly in our heads
and partly out in the world in books and other media and in other people’s 
 Theoretical Tools 177
heads, people we can talk to. The figured world in which children are born
dependent and development is progress towards individual autonomy and
independence as eventual adults who can manage their own lives based on
their own resources is a model that is found in lots of child-raising self-help
books and in the talk and actions of many parents who are professionals (e.g.,
doctors, lawyers, professors, executives, and so forth) with whom we can
interact if we live in the right neighborhood.
Thus, we can state out third theoretical tool, the Figured World Tool. It is
clear that this tool is related to the Filling In Tool, since assumptions about
shared figured worlds is a part of context and what speakers assume listeners
will be able to fill in:
Tool #26: Figured World Tool
For any communication, ask what typical stories or figured worlds the words
and phrases of the communication are assuming and inviting listeners to
assume. What participants, activities, ways of interacting, forms of language,
people, objects, environments, and institutions, as well as values, are in these
figured worlds?
In Section 3.10 we discussed a foreign doctoral student in graduate school in
the United States who has, after several years in the program, lost her PhD
advisor. She needed to get another one. She was talking to a professor who she
wanted as an advisor, but who was reluctant to take her on as a student. She
said: “It’s your job to help me, I need to learn.” While we talked about this
utterance in terms of the Relationships Building Tool, we can also see a conflict
of figured worlds here.
The student was using a figured world of the relationship between professors
and students in which professors were in a helping profession and the students
were the ones they helped. In this figured world there are helpers who have
the skill to help and who are obligated to help if someone needs their help.
The more in need of help the person is, the more the helper is morally and
professionally obligated to help. This figured world fits some professions (e.g.,
doctors, nurses, teachers) better than it does others (e.g., professional sports,
accountants, bookies). And since all figured worlds are oversimplified, it does
not always actually fit well the professions for which it is a best fit (e.g.,
doctors and hospitals who will not treat poor people who are sick).
The professor’s figured world of the relationship between professors and
students was different, perhaps based on his own graduate education and his
years in the profession. He saw the professor as training students who are
already well on their way to being professionals and who, if they succeeded as
researchers themselves, would be his legacy. The relationship was mutually
beneficial. This is not an uncommon model for professors in disciplines like 
 178 Theoretical Tools
physics, say, though professors in education (and in ESL) sometimes do adopt
the helping profession model.
The conflict in the student and professor’s figured worlds could best have
been resolved if it had risen to consciousness and been overtly discussed.
Then the student could have had the opportunity to rephrase her request or
the professor could have rethought the role of helping in his profession. But
figured worlds (typical stories of how things typically are in the world) are
usually unconscious and taken-for-granted. It can be an important strategy for
people to seek to understand them better and bring them to overt attention
when there are conflicts in communication.

4.9 Working with the Figured Worlds Tool
Figured worlds are “theories” or models or pictures that people hold about
how things work in the world when they are “typical” or “normal.” We all
hold a myriad of such figured worlds. We all use them so that we do not have
to consciously think about everything before we talk and act. The best way to
get at what figured worlds a speaker is assuming in a given context is to ask
the following question: What must this speaker assume about the world—
take to be typical or normal—in order to have spoken this way, to have said
these things in the way they were said? Often interviewing people is a good
way to uncover figured worlds (e.g., people’s assumptions about what typical
schools and schooling look like).
Because figured worlds deal in what is taken as typical or normal, they can
sometimes become means to judge and discriminate against people who are
taken as untypical or not normal. Often the sense of typical or normal that is
captured in a figured world lapses over into a notion of what is “appropriate”
or “good.”

Problem 44
Below are two excerpts from interviews or working men in Rhode Island from
Claudia Strauss’s important 1992 paper “What makes Tony run?” (see Reading
at end of this Section for citation). Reflect on the data and answer the questions
below.
I believe if you put an effort into anything, you can get ahead. ... If I want to
succeed, I’ll succeed. It has to be, come from within here. Nobody else is going to
make you succeed but yourself... And, if anybody disagrees with that, there’s
something wrong with them. (p. 202)
[The worker is discussing the workers’ fight against the company’s proposal
mandating Sunday work] But when that changed and it was negotiated through a
contract that you would work, so you had to change or keep losing that eight
hours pay. With three children, I couldn’t afford it. So I had to go with the flow
and work the Sundays. (p. 207)
Questions:
1. State the figured world (the picture of the world or a story about the
world each speaker takes for granted as expressing what is “typical” or
“normal”; how the speaker assumes “things work” in the world) expressed
in each excerpt. How do they differ?
2. The figured world or cultural model expressed in the first excerpt has
been called “the success model” and is held by a great many people in the
United States. The figured world or cultural model expressed in the
second excerpt has been called “the good provider model.” Strauss found
that the working class men she interviewed held both models, though
they were often in conflict in their lives. When their lives did not lead to
success (often because they had chosen to support their families over
their own interests as individuals) in larger societal terms (e.g., having to
do with things like income) who do you think they blamed?
3. Strauss found that upper-middle-class men often sacrificed the needs of
their families when they moved in order to take better jobs in order to
achieve success. Why do you think they did this? She found that the
working class men she interviewed did not do this and sometimes gave up
promotions and new job opportunities rather than harm their families
other interests. Why do you think they did this?
Problem 45
In Section 3.15 you worked with some data from a college professor being
interviewed about her views on race in society. This data is reprinted below.
Though this speaker is using academic language, there are, of course, still 
 180 Theoretical Tools
figured worlds at play in her talk. Indeed, these figured worlds are influenced
by her academic discipline, but also carry over into her views of the world
around her in her own town.
When academic disciplines develop theories of the world, especially in the
social sciences, they are like figured worlds, but usually more explicit and we
hope more open to evidence and falsification. We call them “theories” (but,
remember, theories are themselves simplified views of the world used to help
us understand the world better by leaving aside some of its complexity).
It is, of course, possible that an academic discipline claims that something
is a theory that really just replicates the figured worlds of some group of
people in society. This most certainly happened in psychology when
psychologists in the first half of the twentieth century claimed, often in
textbooks, that African-Americans were inferior to Whites and women inferior
to men in many respects.
The speaker’s reference to different levels of reality is a core theme of much
work in the social sciences. The distinction between the “macro” level (the
level of institutions and large social trends) and the “micro” level (the level of
human social interactions) has been deeply important to the social sciences.
At the same time it is a major problem in the social sciences as to how to
understand the relationship between the macro level and the micro level. Do
larger institutional and social forces cause individuals’ social actions and
interactions or are larger institutional and social forces simply made up of
these social actions and interactions? There are important questions here. We
are concerned in analyzing the data below in the uses the speaker makes of
“levels.”
Reflect on the data and then answer the questions below.
Interviewer: . . . How, do you see racism happening, in society, let’s put it that
way.
1. Um, well, I could answer on, on a variety of different levels // [I: uh huh]
2. Um, at the most macro level /
3. Uum, I think that there’s um, um /
4. I don’t want to say this in a way that sounds like a conspiracy / [I: mm hm]
5. But I think um, that um, basically that the lives of people of color are are, are
irrelevant to the society anymore // [I: mm hm]
6. Um, they’re not needed for the economy because we have the third world to
run away into for cheap labor // [I: uh huh]
7. Um, and I think that, that the leadership /
8. This country really doesn’t care if they shoot each other off in in the ghettos
/ [I: uh huh]
9. Um, and, and so they let drugs into the ghettos /
10. And they, um, they, let people shoot themselves /
11. Shoot each other /
12. And they don’t have, a police force that is really gonna, um, work /
13. And they cut the programs that might alleviate some of the problems //
14. And, um—
 Theoretical Tools 181
15. So I think there’s /
16. That it’s manifested at, at the most, structural level as, um, you know, a real
hatred, of, of, of uh people of color //[I: uh huh]
17. And, and it’s shown, in, the cutbacks and so forth //
18. And, um, I think that um, that, it’s, it’s reflected in, in the fact that, they’re,
they’re viewed as, expendable / [I: mm hm]
19. By our leadership //
20. Um, and so I think, I see cutbacks in programs as just a, an example of, of a
broader/ [I: mm hm]
21. You know, sense, that, that, from the point of view of, of those in power /
22. People of color are expendable / [I: uh huh]
23. And, and irrelevant //
Questions:
1. State the basic figured world this speaker is using in terms of how people,
activities, institutions, and environments function in this picture of the
world (e.g., Who or what are the actors and what do they do?).
2. Would you call the picture of the world behind this speaker’s
communication here a “theory” or a “figured world” (which are theories
or pictures of the world that are more tacit, taken-for-granted and often
more simplified than academic theories) or some of both?
3. What is the situated meaning of the phrase “people of color” here (e.g.,
consider the use of the word “ghetto”). Who are being taken as typical
“people of color”? Why?
4. Can you think of figured worlds (picture of the world) that some people
might hold that would be quite different than the one expressed by the
speaker above? Who might these people be and why would they hold a
different model?
5. What would social activism look like if one accepts the figured world
expressed by this speaker? What are some different figured worlds an
activist for causes concerned with poverty and equity in society might
assume as a starting point?

4.10 The Big D Discourse Tool
People talk and act not just as individuals, but as members of various sorts of
social and cultural groups. We do not invent our language, we inherit it from
others. We understand each other because we share conventions about how to 
 182 Theoretical Tools
use and interpret language. We can most certainly innovate within these
conventions—create new words, give new situated meanings to words, find
new ways of saying things—but these innovations must be shared with others
in order to be understood and to survive. Furthermore, our innovations are
carried out against the background of shared conventions about how to use
and interpret language.
The social groups with which we share conventions about how to use and
interpret language are many and varied. These groups include cultures; ethnic
groups; professions like doctors, lawyers, teachers, and carpenters; academic
disciplines; interest-driven groups like bird watchers and video gamers; and
organizations like street gangs, the military, and sports teams. There are yet
many other sorts of social groups. Each of them has distinctive ways with
words associated with distinctive identities and activities.
There is no one word for all these sorts of groups within which we humans
act out distinctive identities and activities. People have tried various names for
them: “cultures” (broadening the term), “communities of practice,” “speech
communities,” “discourse communities,” “activity systems,” “actor-actant
networks,” and others. Each label is meant to capture just some such groups
or just some aspects of such groups.
I will use the term “Discourse” with a capital “D” (so-called “big D
Discourses”). I use this term because such groups continue through time—for
the most part, they were here before we arrived on earth and will be here after
we leave—and we can see them as communicating (discoursing) with each
other through time and history, using us as their temporary mouthpieces.
We introduced the term “social language” earlier for distinctive styles or
varieties of language with which people enact specific socially recognizable
identities and actions or activities. Social languages allow people to speak as
certain types of African-Americans, Anglo-Americans, doctors, soldiers,
gamers, mathematicians, gang members, bird watchers, politicians, or any of
a great many other things. However, when we enact an identity in the world,
we do not just use language all by itself to do this. We use language, but we
also use distinctive ways of acting, interacting with others, believing, valuing,
dressing, and using various sorts of objects and tools in various sorts of
distinctive environments.
If you want to show me you are a basketball player you cannot just talk the
talk, you have to walk the walk and do that with a basketball on a basketball
court in front of other people. If you want to get recognized as a devout Catholic,
you cannot just talk the “right” way about the “right” things, you also have to
engage in certain actions (like going to Mass) with the “right” people (e.g.,
priests) in the “right” places (e.g., church) and you have to display the “right”
sorts of beliefs (e.g., about the virgin birth of Christ from his mother Mary) and
values (e.g., deference to the Pope). The same is true of trying to get recognized
as a “Native American,” a “good student,” a “tough policeman,” or a “competent
doctor.” You need to talk the talk and walk the walk.
 Theoretical Tools 183
A Discourse with a capital “D” (I will use “discourse” with a little “d” just
to mean “language in use” or stretches of oral or written language) is composed
of distinctive ways of speaking/listening and often, too, distinctive ways
writing/reading. These distinctive ways of speaking/listening and/or reading/
writing are coupled with distinctive ways of acting, interacting, valuing,
feeling, dressing, thinking, and believing. In turn, all of these are coupled with
ways of coordinating oneself with (getting in synch with) other people and
with various objects, tools, and technologies. All this is in the service of
enacting specific socially recognizable identities. These identities might be
things like being–doing a Los Angeles Latino street-gang member, a Los
Angeles policeman, a field biologist, a first-grade student in a specific classroom
and school, a “SPED” student, a certain type of doctor, lawyer, teacher,
African-American, Mexican-American, worker in a “quality control”
workplace, man, woman, boyfriend, girlfriend, or regular at the local bar, etc.,
through a nearly endless list.
Discourses are about being “kinds of people.” There are different ways to be
an African-American, Latino, or Anglo. Thus, there are different kinds of
African-Americans or different kinds for any other social or cultural group.
Being a policeman is to act out a kind of person. So is being a “tough cop,”
which is to talk and act as sub-kind of person within the kind of being a
policeman. Being a SPED student (“Special Ed”) is one way to be a kind of
student, it is one kind of student. There are kinds within kinds.
Kinds of people appear in history and some disappear. At one time in
history, in England and the United States, you could be recognized as a witch,
if you talked the talked and walked the walk (and you might in some cases do
so unintentionally). Now it is much harder to get recognized as a witch in
many of the places where it was once much easier, though there are still places
in the world where you can get recognized as a witch. That “kind of person”
has pretty much disappeared in England and the United States.
The whole point of taking about Discourses is to focus on the fact that when
people mean things to each other, there is always more than language at stake.
To mean anything to someone else (or even to myself) I have to communicate
who I am (in the sense of what socially-situated identity am I taking on here
and now). I also have to communicate what I am doing in terms of what
socially-situated activity I am seeking to carry out, since Discourses (being
and doing kinds of people) exist in part to allow people to carry out certain
distinctive activities (e.g., arresting people for a policeman, taking communion
for a Catholic, getting an “A” for a good student).
Language is not enough for this. We have to get our minds and deeds
“right,” as well. We also have to get ourselves appropriately in synch with
various objects, tools, places, technologies, and other people. Being in a
Discourse is being able to engage in a particular sort of “dance” with words,
deeds, values, feelings, other people, objects, tools, technologies, places and
times so as to get recognized as a distinctive sort of who doing a distinctive 
 184 Theoretical Tools
sort of what. Being able to understand a Discourse is being able to recognize
such “dances.”
Discourses are not units or tight boxes with neat boundaries. Rather they
are ways of recognizing and getting recognized as certain sorts of whos doing
certain sorts of whats. One and the same “dance” can get recognized in
multiple ways, in partial ways, in contradictory ways, in disputed ways, in
negotiable ways, and so on and so forth through all the multiplicities and
problematics that work on postmodernism has made so popular. Discourses
are matters of enactment and recognition, then.
All recognition processes involve satisfying a variety of constraints in
probabilistic and sometimes partial ways. For example, something recognized
as a “weapon” (e.g., a baseball bat or a fireplace poker) may share some
features with prototypical weapons (like a gun, sword, or club) and not share
other features. And there may be debate about the matter. Furthermore, the
very same thing might be recognized as a weapon in one context and not in
another. So, too, with being in and out of Discourses, e.g., enacting and
recognizing being–doing a certain type of street gang member, Special Ed
student, or particle physicist.
While there is an endless array of Discourses in the world, nearly all human
beings, except under extraordinary conditions, acquire an initial Discourse
within whatever constitutes their primary socializing unit early in life. Early
in life, we all learn a culturally distinctive way of being an “everyday person”
as a member of our family and community. We can call this our “primary
Discourse.” Our primary Discourse gives us our initial and often enduring
sense of self and sets the foundations of our culturally specific vernacular
language (our “everyday language”), the language in which we speak and act
as “everyday” (non-specialized) people.
As a person grows up, lots of interesting things can happen to his or her
primary Discourse. Primary Discourses can change, hybridize with other
Discourses, and they can even die. In any case, for the vast majority of us, our
primary Discourse, through all its transformations, serves us throughout life
as what I will call our “life world Discourse.” Our life world Discourse is the
way that we use language, feel and think, act and interact, and so forth, in
order to be an “everyday” (non-specialized) person. In our pluralistic world
there is much adjustment and negotiation as people seek to meet in the terrain
of the life world, given that life worlds are culturally distinctive (that is,
different groups of people have different ways of being–doing “everyday
people”).
All the Discourses we acquire later in life, beyond our primary Discourse,
we acquire within a more “public sphere” than our initial socializing group.
We can call these “secondary Discourses.” They are acquired within
institutions that are part and parcel of wider communities, whether these be
religious groups, community organizations, schools, businesses, or
governments. 
 Theoretical Tools 185
As we are being socialized early in life, secondary Discourses very often play
an interesting role. Primary Discourses work out, over time, alignments and
allegiances with and against other Discourses, alignments and allegiances that
shape them as they, in turn, shape these other Discourses.
One way that many social groups achieve an alignment with secondary
Discourses they value is by incorporating certain aspects of the practices of
these secondary Discourses into the early (primary Discourse) socialization of
their children. For example, some African-American families incorporate
aspects of practices and values that are part of African-American churches into
their primary Discourse, as my family incorporated aspects of practices and
values of a very traditional Catholicism into our primary Discourse. This is an
extremely important mechanism in terms of which bits and pieces of a valued
“community” or “public” identity (to be more fully practiced later in the
child’s life) is incorporated as part and parcel of the child’s “private,” “homebased,” life world identity.
Social groups that are deeply affiliated with formal schooling often
incorporate into the socialization of their children practices that resonate with
later school-based secondary Discourses. For example, their children from an
early age are encouraged (and coached) at dinner time to tell stories in quite
expository ways that are rather like little essays, or parents interact with their
children over books in ways that encourage a great deal of labeling and the
answering of a variety of different types of questions, as well as the forming of
intertextual relationships between books and between books and the world.
There are, of course, complex relationships between people’s primary
Discourses and the secondary ones they are acquiring, as well as among their
academic, institutional, and community-based secondary Discourses. For
example, children acquire a secondary Discourse when they go to school, a
Discourse that involves the identity of being a student of a certain kind and
using certain kinds of “school language” (this Discourse can change across
grades and levels of schooling). This identity and these forms of language can,
at points, conflict with the identities, values, and ways with words some
children have learned at home as part of their primary Discourse. For other
children there is a much better fit or match.
Here is one example of such a conflict. In some Native American groups,
people in a subordinate status stay quiet in the presence of elders or people of
higher status who speak and display their knowledge. School often requires
children to talk and display their knowledge to the teacher so she can assess
it. But the teacher is higher status, the authority figure, and the child’s homebased Discourse dictates listening and not speaking and displaying in this sort
of context.
We can now introduce our last theoretical tool, the Big “D” Discourse Tool.
Keep in mind that Discourses can mix or be ambiguous. For example, an
African-American running for office might, in giving a talk in a church, be
speaking and acting from a mixture of a church Discourse—seeking to get 
 186 Theoretical Tools
recognized as a Christian of a certain sort—and a political Discourse—seeking
to get recognized as a politician of a certain sort. Or there may be ambiguity
about which Discourse is in play at which time. When people speak and act
they are “bidding” to get recognized as a certain kind of person and the “bid”
may not always be successful (and may be successful in some contexts and not
in others) or the person may get recognized in different ways than he or she
intended.
Tool #27: The Big D Discourse Tool
For any communication, ask how the person is using language, as well as ways
of acting, interacting, believing, valuing, dressing, and using various objects,
tools, and technologies in certain sorts of environments to enact a specific
socially recognizable identity and engage in one or more socially recognizable
activities. Even if all you have for data is language, ask what Discourse is this
language part of, that is, what kind of person (what identity) is this speaker or
writer seeking to enact or get recognized. What sorts of actions, interactions,
values, beliefs, and objects, tools, technologies, and environments are associated
with this sort of language within a particular Discourse?

4.11 Working with the Big D Discourse Tool
Discourses take us beyond language. In order to study them we have to
research both language and people’s actions, interactions, values, beliefs, and
uses of objects, tools, and environments within social or institutional settings.
This, though, is part of a job we have seen we already have as discourse 
 Theoretical Tools 187
analysts, namely to study the context in which a spoken or written
communication occurs.
We can analyze communications in terms of the Discourses they express
(what identity the speaker is trying to get recognized) or in terms of how they
talk about and imply things about Discourses and how Discourses inter-relate
in the world. Often when we speak we not only speak out of a given Discourse
(e.g., biology) but also say or imply things about other, sometimes competing,
Discourses (e.g., creationism).
Problem 46
In Section 3.17 we discussed the state of Arizona’s policy on teaching
immigrant children. Immigrant students are grouped in classrooms based on
English language proficiency determined by a test (the Arizona English
Language Learner Assessment—AZELLA). In these classrooms, the children
receive four hours of mandated skill-based English language instruction each
day. Teaching and learning does not include the content areas, such as science
or social studies. Students are segregated from native English speaking
students in these four-hour blocks. No other language than English and no
bilingual education are allowed in these classrooms. On the basis of the
AZELLA test children are given a score between 1 and 4 and placed with
students with the same number. If the children do not make fairly rapid
progress to learning English and move on to regular mainstream classrooms
the teachers and their schools can be sanctioned in various ways.
Below several teachers are talking to researcher (Amy) about these
classrooms in which they teach. Read and reflect on the data and then answer
the questions following [Data from: Heineke, A. J. (2009). Teacher’s discourse
on English language learners: Cultural models of language and learning.

Erica: But I think that I’ve probably seen this difference [linguistic] because I
[my classroom] am the mix, I have threes and fours, so I can see like those
[students] who – and I have some threes that I swear could be fours, I
don’t think they’re three.
Amy: What do you see as the distinction between [a three and four]?
Erica: Like they learn, well, I won’t say they learn things faster, but they do seem to
pick up a little faster, and then their output [spoken English] is so different.
Joni: Between a four and a three? Yeah.
Erica: Oh, yes. Like the output is different. Like they’re the kind of kids that will
take the language objectives and remember to use it, they are the ones
that are a little bit more self-initiated. They will try to read, if you say
point to the words and follow me, they will, these are seen as differences
between a three and a four.
Joni: My home base is fours, and I mean, they rock, most of my kids rock.

Questions:
1. The Arizona policy is only a few years old. However it is creating a new
Discourse. Students and teachers must find ways to be the “kinds of
students” and “the kinds of teachers” that this policy and its implementation
has required. To be these kinds, the students and teachers must talk, act,
interact, value, think, and relate to various objects and environments in
certain ways. From what I have told you about the policy and from the
language above what are some of the ways of talking, acting, interacting,
thinking and valuing that this Discourse does or probably will involve?
What sorts of objects and environments play roles in this Discourse and
what sort of roles do they play?
2. How is this emerging Discourse changing language, giving rise to what
might be aspects of a new social language?
3. How does the concept of figured worlds relate to this data? Discourses
recruit favored figured worlds (that is models or pictures of what is typical
in the world). What figured worlds are expressed or assumed by the way
these teachers are communicating?
4. Erica seems to equate a child’s level of English, intelligence, and
willingness to follow instructions. Why does she do this? Are the three
really things that go together?
Problem 47

his Mexican family they called anything rolled in a tortilla a “taco.” They did
not use the word “burrito.” He goes on to say:
In fact, many Mexicans in my circle would say that “taco” is metaphorical (actually
metonymic—the Mexicans I know tend to be precise in their use of classical rootwords), an icon that stands for much more than a piece of food. Vamos a echarnos
un taco, literally “let’s go throw a taco on ourselves,” means something like “let’s
do lunch” or, more liturgically, “let us break bread together.” Here, no one is
really talking about bread. It is a way of indicating an interest in establishing or
reinforcing a friendship beyond whatever formal roles the participants may be
playing. In this, “taco” may be sociolinguistically unique; you don’t hear people
inviting someone to throw an enchilada or tamale (sic) on each other, thankfully.
(If they did, I imagine it would be taken as an invitation to some sort of kinky
Mexican duel—but that would be different.)
Questions:
1. How does the concept of Discourse we have developed apply to this text? What
aspects of a certain type of “being a Mexican” Discourse is Ruiz pointing to?
 Theoretical Tools 189
2. What objects, ways of acting, interacting, valuing, objects, and
environments play a role in this Discourse and what role do they play?
Problem 48
Pick a Discourse of which you are a member and detail some of the ways of
talking, acting, interacting, believing, valuing, and using objects, tools, and
environments that help people in this Discourse recognize others as in it or
bidding to be in it. For example, if you were Native American or an avid gamer
how do you get recognized as a Native American or gamer and how do you
recognize others as Native Americans or gamers? Feel free to write a piece
along the lines of Ruiz’s text above where he uses some telling details to spell
out a little piece of a Discourse (in Ruiz’s case, of what it means to be a Mexican
of a certain sort, namely the sort he and others in his “circle” are).
4.12 The Big C Conversation Tool
Big D Discourses—socially recognizable ways of being different kinds of
people—often existed before we were born and will go on existing long after
we die. Discourses are partly defined in terms of their relationships of
allegiance and opposition to each other. It is as if they use us humans (for our
time on earth) to talk to, with, and against each other. Historically, Jews,
Muslims, Catholics, and Protestants; capitalists, socialists, Marxists, and
anarchists; different races, ethnic groups, nations, and cultures, and even the
fans of competing sports teams, television shows, or video games have defined
themselves in relations to each other.
When we humans talk about the public debates that swirl around us in the
media, in our reading, and in our interactions with other people, we are
talking and taking part in debates among the Discourses that make up society.
On certain large issues (e.g., abortion, smoking, gambling, feminism,
affirmative action, etc.) nearly everyone in the society know what the “sides”
are, how these sides are talked about and argued for, and what sort of people
tend to be on specific sides. Some such issues are known by nearly everyone
in a society, but others are known only by specifically defined groups (e.g., the
ongoing big controversies in a given academic field, controversies which can
be debated over a great many years). This knowledge about public issues and
their sides is an ever present background people bring to their interpretations
of what they hear and read or in terms of which you can formulate their own
talk and writing.
I will call such public debates, arguments, motifs, issues, or themes
“Conversations” with a capital “C,” speaking metaphorically as if the various
sides in debates around issues like abortion or smoking were engaged in one
grand conversation (or debate or argument, whatever we want to call it). Of
course, this big Conversation is composed of myriad of interactional events 
 190 Theoretical Tools
taking place among specific people at specific times and places and within
specific institutions.
Let me give you an example of what I am trying to get at here. It has for
some time now been fashionable for businesses to announce (in “mission
statements”) their “core values” in an attempt to create a particular company
“culture” (see Collins and Porras 1994; examples below are from pp. 68–69).
For instance, at one time, the announced core values of Johnson & Johnson,
a large pharmaceutical company, included “The company exists to alleviate
pain and disease” and “Individual opportunity and reward based on merit,” as
well as several others.
One might wonder, then, what the core values of a cigarette company might
be. Given the Conversations that most of us are familiar with—about the U.S.
and its history, as well as about smoking—we can almost predict what they
will be. For example, the espoused core values of Philip Morris, a large
company which sells cigarettes among a great many other products, once
included “The right to personal freedom of choice (to smoke, to buy whatever
one wants) is worth defending,” “Winning—being the best and beating
others,” and “Encouraging individual initiative,” as well as (in a statement
similar to one of Johnson & Johnson’s statements) “Opportunity to achieve
based on merit, not gender, race, or class.”
We all readily connect Philip Morris’s core value statements to themes of
American individualism and freedom. We can interpret these statements in
light of what we know about various Conversations that have gone on
historically in the United States not just over smoking itself, but also over
freedom, individuality, government, and other topics. Conversations interact
and affect each other. Note how the values of “individual initiative” and
“reward for merit,” which are part of the core values of both Johnson and
Johnson and Philip Morris, take on a different coloring in the two cases. In the
first case, they take on a humanistic coloring and in the other the coloring of
“every man for himself.” This coloring is the effect of our knowledge of the
two sides to the “smoking Conversation” in which, we all know, individual
freedom is pitted against social responsibility. This debate has gone on now
for decades and is, perhaps, near its end in places like the United States where
social responsibility, coupled with heath issues and health care costs are close
to winning out and closing the historical debate over smoking.
Note here, then, how values, beliefs, and objects play a role in the sorts of
Conversations I am talking about. We know that in this Conversation some
people will hold values and beliefs consistent with expressions about
individualism, freedom, the “American way,” and so forth, while others will
express values and beliefs consistent with the rights of others, social
responsibility, and protecting people from harm, even harm caused by their
own desires. In turn, these two value and belief orientations can be historically
tied to much wider dichotomies centering around beliefs about the
responsibilities and the role of governments.
 Theoretical Tools 191
Furthermore, within this Conversation, an object like a cigarette or an
institution like a tobacco company, or an act like the act of smoking itself, take
on meanings—symbolic values—within the Conversation, but dichotomous
meanings. Smoking can be seen as an addiction, an expression of freedom, or
a lack of caring about others. The point is that those familiar with the Smoking
Conversation and the other Conversations it engages with, know the possible
meanings of cigarettes, tobacco companies, and smoking.
The themes and values that enter into Conversations circulate in a multitude
of texts and media. They are the products of historical disputes between and
among different Discourses. Think, for example, of the historic debate between
the Discourse of evolutionary biologists and the Discourse of fundamentalist
creationists. This debate, over time, has constituted a Conversation that many
people in society know something about. For that reason it is hard for a
newspaper to discuss evolution in any terms without triggering people to
think about this debate and to try to interpret what the newspaper is saying in
terms of it.
People are often unaware of specific historical clashes among Discourses
(e.g., the Reformation, the history of creationism, the changing nature of
feminist Discourses). Often they are only aware of the residue of issue, debates,
claims, and clashes that make up Big C Conversations. Historical interactions
of Discourses leads to certain debates (“Conversations”), (for example,
debates over smoking, race, evolution, global warming, and “nature” of men
and women, males, females, and gays) being known widely by people in a
society or social group, even by people who are not themselves members of
those Discourses or even aware of their histories.
Big C Conversations—the topics, issues, sides, and debates that have
become widely known in society at large or among large groups of people as
they have enacted their Discourses (multiple identities) through history in
talk, texts, and media—gives us our last tool:
Tool #28: The Big C Conversation Tool
For any communication, ask what issues, sides, debates, and claims the
communication assumes hearers or readers know or what issues, sides, debates,
and claims they need to know to understand the communication in terms of
wider historical and social issues and debates. Can the communication be seen
as carrying out a historical or widely known debate or discussion between or
among Discourses? Which Discourses?

4.13 Working with the Big C Conversation Tool
I am using the term (“Big C”) “Conversation” here because I want to stress
that sometimes as members of a wider society and other times as members of
social or cultural groups we realize or can come to realize that our everyday
conversations and what we hear and react to in books and/on media constitutes
Conversations among Discourse in history and not just talk and texts in the
here and now. Often we understand issues in society in terms of at least partial
understandings of how different kinds of people have talked, acted, and
argued in history.
Problem 49
Discuss how the election of Barack Obama and the controversies it caused can
be understood in terms of different kinds of peoples’—different Discourses’—
interactions now and in history. What different historical kinds of people or
Discourses are involved? What are the issues and the “sides” in the debate?
Problem 50
Discuss the issue of how global warming caused by human activities can be
understood in terms of different kinds of peoples’—different Discourses’—
interactions now and in history. What different historical kinds of people or
Discourses are involved? What are the issues and the sides in the debate? Can
you name any actual people alive today who are strongly associated with
particular Discourses with a stake in the issue of global warming?
Problem 51
Below is a quote from an interview I once gave about using video games for
learning and education:
All technologies can be good or bad depending on how they are used. Textbooks
are pervasive in schools but one of the worst learning technologies ever invented,
because they try to do everything with one tool, standardized for everyone, with
no care about context and individual differences in learning. We need to be 
 Theoretical Tools 193
careful not to see technology as the main focus, but rather to see the main focus
as creating good interactive learning systems in and out of classrooms, learning
systems that stress participation, deep understanding, problem solving, and
innovation.
People from different backgrounds will read this passage in relation to different
controversies over education, technology, learning, and schools. What are
some of the issues and sides in debates among Discourses that this passage
might be seen as relevant to and in part contributing to? What are the larger
Conversations it engages?

Conclusion
The “tools” approach in this book is meant to stress that speakers and writers
are active designers and builders. They are making things, acting on others
and on the world, and simultaneously reproducing social order, institutions,
and cultures. They are making history as they enact and recognize—and
thereby keep alive—a great variety of different Discourses, different ways of
being in the world, different ways of being certain kinds of people.
All of our tools are basically about “recipient design,” that is, designing for
who we take our listeners or readers to be or who we want them be as we
interact with them. All our tools are also basically about the related notion of
“response design,” that is, designing not just for who we take our listeners and
readers to be or who we want them to be, but designing for what we want
them to do in the world in response to what we have said or written. Here
“who” means “socially recognizable and socially significant types of people,”
identities that in interaction make the social world and make history.
This book is meant to be a beginning to discourse analysis for its readers.
Now that beginning is nearly at an end. The best way for readers to end this
book would be to choose a topic of their own, collect their own data, and
engage in their own discourse analysis. Readers can use each of the 28 tools
we have introduced. This will lead them to ask 28 questions. As I said in the
Introduction, there is no necessary order to the tools. Indeed, it is often useful
to go through them backwards from 28 to 1, or to choose an order that works
for the data and the researcher.
What makes a discourse analysis valid? I take validity to be something that
different analyses can have more or less of, i.e., some analyses are more or less
valid than others. Furthermore, validity is never “once and for all.” All analyses
are open to further discussion and dispute, and their status can go up or down
with time as work goes on in the field. Validity for discourse analysis is based
on the following four elements:
1. Convergence: A discourse analysis is more, rather than less valid (i.e.,
“trustworthy”), the more the answers to the 28 questions converge in the way
they support the analysis or, put the matter the other way round, the more
the analysis offers compatible and convincing answers to many or all of them.
2. Agreement: Answers to the 28 questions above are more convincing the
more “native speakers” of the social languages in the data and “members” 
 196 Conclusion
of the Discourses implicated in the data agree that the analysis reflects
how such social languages actually can function in such settings. The
native speakers do not need to know why or how their social languages so
function, just that they can. Answers to the 28 questions are more
convincing the more other discourse analysts (who accept our basic
theoretical assumptions and tools), or other sorts of researchers (e.g.,
ethnographic researchers), tend to support our conclusions.
3. Coverage: The analysis is more valid the more it can be applied to related
sorts of data. This includes being able to make sense of what has come
before and after the situation being analyzed and being able to predict the
sorts of things that might happen in related sorts of situations.
4. Linguistic Details: The analysis is more valid the more it is tightly tied to
details of linguistic structure. All human languages have evolved,
biologically and culturally, to serve an array of different communicative
functions. For this reason, the grammar of any social language is composed
of specific forms that are “designed” to carry out specific functions,
though any form can usually carry out more than one function. Part of
what makes a discourse analysis valid, then, is that the analyst is able to
argue that the communicative functions being uncovered in the analysis
are linked to grammatical devices that manifestly can and do serve these
functions, according to the judgments of “native speakers” of the social
languages involved and the analyses of linguists.
Why does this constitute validity? Because it is highly improbable that a good
many answers to 28 different questions, the perspectives of different “inside”
and “outside” observers, additional data sets, and the judgments of “native
speakers” and/or linguists will converge unless there is good reason to trust
the analysis. This, of course, does not mean the analysis is true or correct in
every respect. Empirical science is social and accumulative in that investigators
build on each other’s work in ways that, in the long run, we hope, improves
it. It does mean, however, that a “valid” analysis explains things that any
future investigation of the same data, or related data, will have to take seriously
into account.
Well that is the end of this book. This book is about “preparation for future
learning.” I have given you one theory of discourse analysis to use for practice
and for getting a bit familiar with the area. The purpose has not been to get
you to stop here and believe me. It is to prepare you to read further, confront
other perspectives, and reflect on your own views. The book itself, in this
sense, is meant to be a tool to get some initial work done, initial work that will
lead you to yet other tools and other work.
For those who will not themselves be discourse analysts, the goal is to
deepen your view of language in use and to push you to go on to read and
think more about language. For those who will do discourse analysis
professionally, the goal is to show you the territory with the hope that you 
 Conclusion 197
come to make your maps and find your way—and eventually make better and
more novel contributions than this book. For all readers, I hope that I have
added to—and not detracted from—the wonder that is language in human
hands and minds.
What response have I designed my text to get from you? I have wanted
readers to see that language is a force for action, for good or bad, that they are
or can be active designers and makers, and that through language and
understanding Discourses they can change the world for the better. The world
badly needs it. And it is to this identity—as a powerful maker in your own
right, bearing powerful tools—that I hope I have summoned you.

APPENDIX
List of Tools
Tool #1: The Diexis Tool
For any communication, ask how deictics are being used to tie what is said
to context and to make assumptions about what listeners already know or
can figure out. Consider uses of the definite article in the same way. Also ask
what deictic like properties any regular words are taking on in context, that
is, what aspects of their specific meanings need to be filled in from context
(we will see this latter task again later in the Situated Meaning Tool in
Section 4.2).
Tool #2: The Fill In Tool
For any communication, ask: Based on what was said and the context in which
it was said, what needs to be filled in here to achieve clarity? What is not being
said overtly, but is still assumed to be known or inferable? What knowledge,
assumptions, and inferences do listeners have to bring to bear in order for this
communication to be clear and understandable and received in the way the
speaker intended?
Tool #3: The Making Strange Tool
For any communication, try to act as if you are an “outsider.” Ask yourself:
What would someone (perhaps, even a Martian) find strange here (unclear,
confusing, worth questioning) if that person did not share the knowledge and
assumptions and make the inferences that render the communication so
natural and taken-for-granted by insiders?
Tool #4: The Subject Tool
For any communication, ask why speakers have chosen the subject/topics
they have and what they are saying about the subject. Ask if and how they
could have made another choice of subject and why they did not. Why are
they organizing information the way they are in terms of subjects and
predicates? 
 200 List of Tools
Tool #5: The Intonation Tool
For any communication, ask how a speaker’s intonation contour contributes
to the meaning of an utterance. What idea units did the speaker use? What
information did the speaker make salient (in terms of where the intonational
focus is placed)? What information did the speaker background as given or
old by making it less salient? In dealing with written texts, always read them
out loud and ask what sort of intonation contour readers must add to the
sentences to make them make full sense.
Tool #6: The Frame Tool
After you have completed your discourse analysis—after you have taken
into consideration all the aspects of the context that you see as relevant to
the meaning of the data—see if you can find out anything additional about
the context in which the data occurred and see if this changes your
analysis. If it doesn’t, your analysis is safe for now. If it does, you have
more work to do. Always push your knowledge of the context as far as you
can just to see if aspects of the context are relevant that you might at first
have not thought were relevant or if you can discover entirely new aspects
of the context.
Tool #7: The Doing and Not Just Saying Tool
For any communication, ask not just what the speaker is saying, but what he
or she is trying to do, keeping in mind that he or she may be trying to do more
than one thing.
Tool #8: The Vocabulary Tool
For any English communication, ask what sorts of words are being used in
terms of whether the communication uses a preponderance of Germanic
words or of Latinate words. How is this distribution of word types functioning
to mark this communication in terms of style (register, social language)? How
does it contribute to the purposes for communicating?
Tool #9: The Why This Way and Not That Way Tool
For any communication, ask why the speaker built and designed with grammar
in the way in which he or she did and not in some other way. Always ask how
else this could have been said and what the speaker was trying to mean and do
by saying it the way in which he or she did and not in other ways.
List of Tools 201
Tool #10: The Integration Tool
For any communication, ask how clauses were integrated or packaged into
utterances or sentences. What was left out and what was included in terms of
optional arguments? What was left out and what was included when clauses
were turned into phrases? What perspectives are being communicated by the
way in which information is packaged into main, subordinate, and embedded
clauses, as well as into phrases that encapsulate a clause’s worth of information?
Tool #11: The Topic and Theme Tool
For any communication, ask what the topic and theme is for each clause and
what the theme is of a set of clauses in a sentence with more than one clause.
Why were these choices made? When the theme is not the subject/topic, and,
thus, has deviated from the usual (unmarked) choice, what is it and why was
it chosen?
Tool #12: The Stanza Tool
In any communication (that is long enough), look for stanzas and how stanzas
cluster into larger blocks of information. You will not always find them clearly
and easily, but when you do, they are an important aid to organizing your
interpretation of data and of how you can display that interpretation.
Tool #13: The Context is Reflexive Tool
When you use the Fill in Tool, the Doing and Not Just Saying Tool, the Frame
Problem Tool, and the Why This Way and Not That Way Tool, and all other
tools that require that you think about context (and not just what was said),
always ask yourself the following questions:
1. How is what the speaker is saying and how he or she is saying it helping
to create or shape (possibly even manipulate) what listeners will take as
the relevant context?
2. How is what the speaker is saying and how he or she is saying it helping
to reproduce contexts like this one (e.g., class sessions in a university),
that is, helping them to continue to exist through time and space?
3. Is the speaker reproducing contexts like this one unaware of aspects of
the context that if he or she thought about the matter consciously, he or
she would not want to reproduce?
4. Is what the speaker is saying and how he or she is saying it just, more or
less, replicating (repeating) contexts like this one or, in any respect,
transforming or changing them? 
 202 List of Tools
Tool #14: The Significance Building Tool
For any communication, ask how words and grammatical devices are being
used to build up or lessen significance (importance, relevance) for certain
things and not others.
Tool #15: The Activities Building Tool
For any communication, ask what activity (practice) or activities (practices)
this communication is building or enacting. What activity or activities is this
communication seeking to get others to recognize as being accomplished?
Ask also what social groups, institutions, or cultures support and norm (set
norms for) whatever activities are being built or enacted. (The Doing and Not
Saying Tool in Section in Section 2.1 deals with actions; this tool deals with
activities/practices.)
Tool #16: The Identities Building Tool
For any communication, ask what socially recognizable identity or identities
the speaker is trying to enact or to get others to recognize. Ask also how the
speaker’s language treats other people’s identities, what sorts of identities the
speaker recognizes for others in relationship to his or her own. Ask, too, how
the speaker is positioning others, what identities the speaker is “inviting”
them to take up.
Tool #17: The Relationships Building Tool
For any communication, ask how words and various grammatical devices are
being used to build and sustain or change relationships of various sorts among
the speaker, other people, social groups, cultures, and/or institutions.
Tool #18: The Politics Building Tool
For any communication, ask how words and grammatical devices are being
used to build (construct, assume) what count as a social good and to distribute
this good to or withhold it from listeners or others. Ask, as well, how words
and grammatical devices are being used to build a viewpoint on how social
goods are or should be distributed in society.
Tool #19: The Connections Building Tool
For any communication, ask how the words and grammar being used in the
communication connect or disconnect things or ignore connections between
things. Always ask, as well, how the words and grammar being used in a 
List of Tools 203
communication make things relevant or irrelevant to other things, or ignores
their relevance to each other.
Tool #20: The Cohesion Tool
For any communication, ask questions like: How does cohesion work in this
text to connect pieces of information and in what ways? How does the text fail
to connect other pieces of information? What is the speaker trying to
communicate or achieve by using cohesive devices in the way he or she does?
Tool #21: Systems and Knowledge Building Tool
For any communication, ask how the words and grammar being used privilege
or de-privilege specific sign systems (e.g., Spanish vs. English, technical
language vs. everyday language, words vs. images, words vs. equations, etc.)
or different ways of knowing and believing or claims to knowledge and belief?
Tool #22: The Topic Flow or Topic Chaining Tool
For any communication, ask what the topics are of all main clauses and how
these topics are linked to each other to create (or not) a chain that creates an
overall topic or coherent sense of being about something for a stretch of
speech or writing. Topics in subordinated and embedded clauses represent
less prominent topics that are subordinated to the main chain of topics in
main clauses, but it is useful to ask how they relate to the main chain of topics.
Ask, as well, how people have signaled that they are switching topics and
whether they have “spoken topically” by linking back to the old topic in some
first. Look, as well, for topic shifted structures and how they are being used.
Tool #23: The Situated Meaning Tool
For any communication, ask of words and phrases what situated meanings
they have. That is, what specific meanings do listeners have to attribute to
these words and phrases given the context and how the context is construed?
Tool #24: Social Languages Tool
For any communication, ask how it uses words and grammatical structures
(types of phrases, clauses, and sentences) to signal and enact a given social
language. The communication may mix two or more social languages or
switch between two or more. In turn, a social language may be composed of
words or phrases from more than one language (e.g., it may mix English and
Spanish). 
 204 List of Tools
Tool #25: The Intertextuality Tool
For any communication, ask how words and grammatical structures (e.g.,
direct or indirect quotation) are used to quote, refer to, or allude to other
“texts” (that is, what others have said or written) or other styles of language
(social languages).
Tool #26: Figured World Tool
For any communication, ask what typical stories or figured worlds the words
and phrases of the communication are assuming and inviting listeners to
assume. What participants, activities, ways of interacting, forms of language,
people, objects, environments, and institutions, as well as values, are in these
figured worlds?
Tool #27: The Big “D” Discourse Tool
For any communication, ask how the person is using language, as well as ways
of acting, interacting, believing, valuing, dressing, and using various objects,
tools, and technologies in certain sorts of environments to enact a specific
socially recognizable identity and engage in one or more socially recognizable
activities. Even if all you have for data is language, ask what Discourse is this
language part of, that is, what kind of person (what identity) is this speaker or
writer seeking to enact or get recognized. What sorts of actions, interactions,
values, beliefs, and objects, tools, technologies, and environments are
associated with this sort of language within a particular Discourse?
Tool #28: The Big C Conversation Tool
For any communication, ask what issues, sides, debates, and claims the
communication assumes hearers or readers know or what issues, sides,
debates, and claims they need to know to understand the communication in
terms of wider historical and social issues and debates. Can the communication
be seen as carrying out a historical or widely known debate or discussion
between or among Discourses? Which Discourses?
