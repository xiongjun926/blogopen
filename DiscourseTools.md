5. THE JUDGE’S DECISION was explicitly legal, but IT still brings us to question
what social and cultural considerations might have gone into this determination.
Paragraph 2:
6. It is not new THAT JUDGES AND COURTS DECIDE QUESTIONS FOR
WHICH THEIR BACKGROUND MAY BE DEEMED INADEQUATE.
7. SOME OF THESE DECISIONS are much more important than resolving the
ontological status of burritos.
8. In 1896, A COURT decided that a law requiring Black and White people to
use separate public facilities was constitutional.
9. THE PLAINTIFF was Homer Plessy, a man who was one-eighth Black.
The first paragraph starts with the topic “a judge in Massachusetts.” The
indefinite article “a” tells us this topic is new information and not already
assumed known (if it were already assumed known, the author would have
said “The judge in Massachusetts). The second sentence has a dummy subject,
the word “it” and shifts the subject “what his credentials were to make this
decision” towards the back of the sentence. “His credentials” is the subject/
topic of this embedded clause (the clause is itself a shifted subject). In “his
credentials,” “his” refers back to “a judge in Massachusetts.” Sentence (3) has
the topic “his name,” with “his” once again linking back to the judge. So we
get the chain: “a judge in Massachusetts”  “his credentials”  “his name,”
all of which are about the judge. This chain of topics all referring to the judge
creates a coherent sense that the paragraph so far is about one thing.
The shifted subject structure in (2) is a way to introduce “what his
credentials were to make this decision” as both a topic and important new
information. In fact, it is the central idea around which the whole paragraph
turns. The paragraph is about the judge’s lack of cultural credentials and the
fact that the author does have such credentials.
Then we get an aside, placed in parentheses in sentence (4). Here we have a
two conjoined clauses (both main clauses, then), both of which have the topic
“I.” These two “I” topics follow a number of mentions of the author himself in
the preceding sentence. In fact, we get a run of “I” subjects in subordinated or
embedded clauses preceding the conjoined clauses in (4), which constitutes “I”
as a sort of sub-topic in this paragraph. And, indeed, the author is trying to try
a comparison and contrast between the judge and himself:
… that I and many others like me have had
although I fully acknowledge
that names are not
a good way to determine national origin
(I went to school with a Mexican-American named Plunkett
and I work with a Puerto Rican who counts Schwartzkopf as one of his family names). 
Building Things in the World 151
(5) is another sentence made up of two conjoined clauses. The topic of the
first conjoined clause is “the judge’s decision” and the topic of the second is
the pronoun “it” referring to the judge’s decision. So, after the aside we
return to the judge as the overall topic of the paragraph. The embedded
topic “social and cultural considerations” in (5), which is new information,
introduces in a subordinated way a topic that will become prominent later
in the essay.
In this first paragraph the author is saying things about the judge that
question his credentials, especially his cultural credentials. A sub-theme in
the paragraph is about the author himself (“I”). About himself, the author says
things that make clear his own cultural credentials as a Mexican-American,
but one with sophistication about culture in a cosmopolitan country like the
United States. He thus, juxtaposes his cultural competence against his
suspicion of the judge’s lack of such competence.
In the second paragraph the author wants to change topics away from the
judge to a list of court decisions. He does this by using a shifted subject
structure: “It is not new THAT JUDGES AND COURTS DECIDE QUESTIONS
FOR WHICH THEIR BACKGROUND MAY BE DEEMED INADEQUATE.”
This allows him to introduce the embedded clause “that judges and courts
decide questions for which their background may be deemed inadequate” as
an important topic and new information. In fact, it is the topic of the next
paragraph as a whole. The subject/topic of this embedded clause (“judges and
courts”) links back to the topic of the first paragraph (the judge) and, thus,
speaks topically.
In sentence (7) the subject/topic is “some of these decisions,” which links
back to “that judges and courts decide questions for which their background
may be deemed inadequate” via the “decide”/”decisions” relationship. The
author then lists several decisions (I quote only one) where courts made
culturally insensitive decisions of much greater consequence than the decision
about burritos. The topics of sentence (8)—“court”—and (9)—“plaintiff”—
are terms that link back to “some of these decisions,” since legal decisions
involve courts and plaintiffs. So, again, we get a chain of topics that give
coherence and unity to the paragraph.
The author both controls topic flow—or chains topics—and introduces
topics that are new information in lucid ways that help focus and guide the
attention of his reader. It should be clear, too, that topic chaining or topic flow
is a form of creating cohesion and, in turn, uses several of the cohesive devices
we discussed in Grammar Interlude #8. Topic chaining ties sentences together
across an oral or written text and helps listeners organize information in their
minds.
In doing a discourse analysis it is always a good idea to map topics as I have
done, since topic flow or topic chaining is one key way speakers and writers
create a perspective and seek to control their listeners and readers attention.
This allows us to introduce another grammatical tool:
 152 Building Things in the World
Tool #22: The Topic Flow or Topic Chaining Tool
For any communication, ask what the topics are of all main clauses and how
these topics are linked to each other to create (or not) a chain that creates an
overall topic or coherent sense of being about something for a stretch of speech
or writing. Topics in subordinated and embedded clauses represent less
prominent topics that are subordinated to the main chain of topics in main
clauses, but it is useful to ask how they relate to the main chain of topics. Ask,
as well, how people have signaled that they are switching topics and whether
they have “spoken topically” by linking back to the old topic in some first. Look,
as well, for topic shifted structures and how they are being used.
Problem 35
Below is data from the history project we have discussed several times before.
You saw this data before in Section 3.17. Karen, Jane (teachers), and Joe (an
administrator) work in the Middleview schools. They were born in Middleview
and they intend to stay there and want their children to stay there. Sara is a
university professor not born in Middleview (or the state it is in) and not
intending to stay there (and she eventually moved to another university to
advance her career).
How are topics and topic chaining working in this conversation? How do
topics and topic chaining work here to communicate a sense of identity? How
are topic shifted structures being used? Does Sara speak topically (i.e., tie
back to the topic being talked before or while introducing a new topic)? Does
Jane in her last contribution speak topically by linking back to Sara’s topic?
How so?
I have capitalized and underlined the subject/topics of each idea unit (tone
unit). I have not here considered the topics of subordinate and embedded
structures that are not tone units by themselves, nor made a distinction
between tone units that are main clauses and ones that are not. (13) and (14)
make up a complex shifted subject structure (“it was …” is a colloquial version
of “there was …”). (23) is another shifted subject structure. In two cases, I
have placed information in brackets that was not said but which is understood:
KAREN:
1. MY MOTHER used to talk about in the 40s /
2. YOU’d hang around at Union Station/
3. And ANYBODY would just pick you up /
4. Because EVERYBODY was going down to dance at Bright City /

4.1 Six Theoretical Tools
We turn now to six tools that are centered in different theories (core ideas)
about how language ties to the world and to culture. First, we will draw on a
theory from cognitive psychology about how meaning works. We will
introduce the notion of “situated meanings” and argue that we humans
actively build meanings “live on line” when we use language in specific
contexts.
Second, we will draw on a theory from sociolinguistics about how different
styles or varieties of using language work to allow humans to carry out
different types of social work and enact different socially significant, sociallysituated identities. We will introduce the notion of “social languages” and
argue that any language (like English or Russian) is composed of a great many
different social languages. Each of these is connected to meanings and
activities associated with particular social and cultural groups.
Third we will draw on theories from literary criticism to introduce the
notion of “intertextuality.” When anyone speaks or writes they often make
reference to what other people or various texts (like the Bible) or media (like
movies) have said or meant. They may quote or just allude to what others
have said. This means that one “text” (where the word here means any stretch
of spoken or written language) refers to or points to another “text” (words
from what others have said or written). Thus, if I say “Even though life is
sweet sorrow, I prefer it to the alternative,” I am alluding to (for those in the
know) Shakespeare’s quote that “love is such sweet sorrow” and mixing these
words from Shakespeare into my “text.” Plagiarism is, of course, an extreme
and “stealth” version of such “intertextual” references (that is, references,
quotations, or allusions in one text to another text).
Fourth, we will draw on a theory from psychological anthropology about
how humans form and use theories to give language meaning and understand
each other and the world. Here we will introduce the notion of “figured
worlds.” Figured worlds are narratives and images different social and cultural
groups of people use to make sense of the world. They function as simplified
models of how things work when they are “normal” and “natural” from the
perspective of a particular social and cultural group. They are meant to help
people get on with the business of living and communicating without having
to explicitly reflect in everything before acting.
Fifth, we will draw on theories from a variety of areas (cultural anthropology,
cultural psychology, sociolinguistics, and philosophy) about how meaning
goes well beyond human minds and language to involve objects, tools,
technologies, and networks of people collaborating with each other. Here we
will introduce the notion of “Discourses” with a capital “D” (so-called “big ‘D’
Discourses”). Discourses are ways of enacting and recognizing different sorts
of socially situated and significant identities through the use of language
integrated with characteristic ways of acting, interacting, believing, valuing, 
 Theoretical Tools 157
and using various sorts of objects (including our bodies), tools, and
technologies in concert with other people.
Finally, we will draw on history and the nature of public debates and social
change. Here we will introduce the notion of “Conversations” with a capital
“C” (so-called “big ‘C’ Conversations”). It is not just people that have
conversations with each other. Discourses—historically different kinds of
people enacting and recognizing different socially significant identities—use
people, texts, and media to carry on historically significant Conversations
(debates) among different themselves. Often when I talk as a professor, a
(video) gamer, an environmentalist (a “green”), or as a Baby Boomer what I
say relates to, assumes, and contributes to relatively widely known and
recognized historically evolving topics, issues, debates, controversies, and
different sides in debates.
4.2 The Situated Meaning Tool
Meaning is a very complicated concept. One important distinction we can
make is between the general meaning a word or utterance has (sometimes
called “utterance type meaning”) and the specific meaning a word or utterance
takes on in a specific context of use (sometimes called “utterance token
meaning”).
When we interpret any piece of language we have general expectations about
how our language is normally used. Another way to put this is to say that any
word or structure in language has a certain “meaning potential,” that is, a
range of possible meanings that the word or structure can take on in different
contexts of use. Thus, for example, the word “cat” has to do, broadly, with the
felines; the (syntactic) structure “subject of a sentence” has to do, broadly,
with naming a “topic” in the sense of “what is being talked about.” This is
general meaning (utterance-type meaning.) Such meanings are connected to
the prototypical situations in which a word or structure is usually used.
Such general meanings are what word definitions in dictionaries try to
capture. For example, a definition of “cat” might be something like:
1 a : a carnivorous mammal (Felis catus) long domesticated as a pet and for
catching rats and mice b : any of a family (Felidae) of carnivorous usually solitary
and nocturnal mammals (as the domestic cat, lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, cougar,
wildcat, lynx, and cheetah) [Retrieved September 24, 2009 from www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/cat]
No one knows exactly how definitions work in our heads, though psychologists
and linguists have long studied the matter. Definitions like the one above are
certainly not typical of what is in heads. Few people know cats are classified
as “Felis catus” and not everyone knows cats are carnivorous (or what
“carnivorous” really means, i.e., that cats cannot survive with meat, not just 
 158 Theoretical Tools
that they happen to eat or like meat). What is in our heads is probably a
combination of the following things: images or prototypes of what is typical of
the things the word refers to; information and facts we know (but which not
all of us share exactly); and typical uses of the word and the typical range of
contexts in which the word is normally used.
In any case, we will just talk about “general meanings,” meaning by this the
range of typical meanings a word (or structure) has. This is the “meaning
potential” of the word or the “meaning resources” it represents. Such meaning
potential or meaning resources can, of course, change as we hear the word
used in more contexts or as people change how they use the word.
In actual situations of use, words and structures take on much more specific
meanings within the range of (or, at least, related to the range of) their
meaning potentials. This is what I will call “situated meaning.” Thus, in a
situation where we are discussing species of animals and say something like
“The world’s big cats are all endangered,” “cat” means things like lions and
tigers; in a situation where we are discussing mythology and say something
like “The cat was a sacred symbol to the ancient Egyptians,” “cat” means real
and pictured cats as symbols; and in a situation where we are discussing
breakable decorative objects on our mantel and say something like “The cat
broke,” “cat” means a statue of cat.
Turning to structures, rather than words: while the subjects of sentences
are always “topic-like” (this is their general meaning), in different situations
of use, subjects take on a range of more specific meanings. In a debate, if I say,
“The constitution only protects the rich,” the subject of the sentence (“the
constitution”) is an entity about which a claim is being made; if a friend of
yours has just arrived and I usher her in saying “Mary’s here,” the subject of
the sentence (“Mary”) is a center of interest or attention; and in a situation
where I am commiserating with a friend and say something like “You really
got cheated by that guy,” the subject of the sentence (“you”) is a center of
empathy (signaled also by the fact that the normal subject of the active version
of the sentence—“That guy really cheated you”—has been “demoted” from
subject position through use of the “get-passive”).
So words do not have just general meanings. They have different and
specific meanings in different contexts in which they are used and in different
specialist domains that recruit them. This is true of the most mundane cases.
For instance, notice the change in meaning in the word “coffee” in the
following utterances which refer to different situations: “The coffee spilled, go
get the mop” (coffee as liquid), “The coffee spilled, go get a broom” (coffee as
grains), “The coffee spilled, stack it again” (coffee in cans). Or notice the quite
different meanings of the word “work” in everyday life and in physics (e.g., I
can say, in everyday life, that I worked hard to push the car, but if my efforts
didn’t move the car, I did no “work” in the physics sense of the word).
In actual contexts, people do not just look up the meanings of words in
their heads, like a dictionary. They know the possible range of the meanings 
 Theoretical Tools 159
of a word, but they also know this can change with new uses. People must in
context actively “make up” (guess) the meanings of the words and phrases
they hear. Often this is fairly routine, since they have heard meanings like this
before. But sometimes they must do more work and actively seek to ask what
people must mean here and now if they have said what they said in the context
in which they have said it.
For example, if someone says “The cat is floating away,” in some contexts
they may be referring to a “cat-shaped cloud.” The phrase “things you would
save first from your house in a fire” will mean different specific things to
different people in different contexts (e.g., would you take your cat or your
expensive painting?). To know what it means to you, you have to think about
what meaning you would give it in the context of a fire and your own life.
What does someone mean in the context of current political debates in the
United States by the word “democracy” if they say: “The United States will not
really be a democracy until we have real campaign finance reform.”
So we can introduce the first of our four theoretical tools, the Situated
Meaning Tool:
Tool #23: The Situated Meaning Tool
For any communication, ask of words and phrases what situated meanings they
have. That is, what specific meanings do listeners have to attribute to these
words and phrases given the context and how the context is construed?
The Situated Meaning Tool is obviously closely related to the Filling In Tool.
It is part of what we fill in from context. But it is a particularly crucial part of
the filling in process. Words and phrases in actual contexts of use do not
always have clear dictionary like meanings. Listeners have to figure out—
guess—what they mean based on what else has been said and other aspects of
the context. So do we discourse analysts. Meaning making is not a “look up”
process. It is an active process.
There is one important aspect of situated meaning to keep in mind. One
way we as listeners situate the meanings of words and phrases is to use our
previous experience of—and knowledge of—what is being talked about.
Speakers have to make assumptions about what sorts of experience and
knowledge are shared or shared enough with others to communicate. If you
have never heard about campaign finance reform and know nothing about
U.S. politics, then you cannot situate a meaning for “democracy” in an
utterance like “The United States will not really be a democracy until we have
real campaign finance reform.”
All utterances make assumptions about people’s previous experiences and
knowledge. They assume certain experiences and knowledge in order to be
understood. In that sense, any utterance, in terms of how it is formulated, 
 160 Theoretical Tools
makes assumptions about the “kind of person” who is an “appropriate” or
“acceptable” listener (and maybe even person). We will see this aspect of
language more when we discuss figured worlds and Discourses below.
4.3 Working with the Situated Meaning Tool
The Situated Meaning Tool tells us to ask what words and phrases mean in
specific contexts. In many cases, the meanings of words and phrases in
context are clear and well within the normal and routine range of meanings
these words and phrases typically have. But this is not always the case and
we want to be on the watch for cases where words and phrases are being
given situated meanings that are nuanced and quite specific to the speaker’s
worldview or values or to the special qualities of the context the speaker is
assuming and helping to construe or create (remember the reflexive property
of context).
In this section we will look at cases where the Situated Meaning Tool applies
in important ways.
Problem 36
A typical dictionary definition of “democracy” is “government by the people;
a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and
exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral
system” (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/democracy). This definition
captures pretty well what we have called the general meaning of the word
“democracy.” However, a word like “democracy” is what we might call a
“contested word.” People argue a good bit about what political systems
“really” deserve to be called a “democracy.” People use the word with specific
nuances of meaning that reflect their viewpoints and values.
Consider the quotes below. Each uses the word “democracy.” First, ask
yourself how the definition of democracy, its general meaning, does or does
not fit with the way the word is being used in the quote. Then specify what
situated meaning the word has in each quote (what additional meanings,
connotations, and nuances the word is being given). What does each author
mean in specific terms by the word? Finally, what does the way the author has
used the word “democracy” tell you about his or her value system and political
viewpoint? The quote in (4) is from a ruling of the Israeli Supreme Court. In
(3) you want to analyze what Penalosa has to say about “democracy.”
1. … yet I believe [Milton] Friedman is right that thoroughgoing restrictions
on economic freedom would turn out to be inconsistent with democracy
(Retrieved Sept. 24, 2009 from www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/
2006/11/on_milton_fried.html).
 Theoretical Tools 161
2. If democracy is about creating processes that allow people to empower
themselves, then pirates [people running illegal pirate radio channels] are
clearly the perfect catalyst for such processes (Mason, M., 2008, The
pirate’s dilemma: How youth culture is reinventing capitalism. New York:
Free Press, p. 47).
3. Penalosa [Mayor of Bogota, Columbia] observes that “high quality public
pedestrian space in general and parks in particular are evidence of true
democracy at work” (Brown, L. R., 2008, Plan B 3.0: Mobilizing to save
civilization. Revised and Expanded Edition. Washington, DC: Earth
Policy Institute, p. 193).
4. That is the fate of democracy, in whose eyes not all means are permitted,
and to whom not all the methods used by her enemies are open (The
Public Committee Against Torture in Israel v The State of Israel, cited in
Weisberg, J., 2008, The Bush tragedy. New York: Random House.
pp. 181–82).
Problem 37
In the state of Arizona in the United States, immigrant children take a test of
their English proficiency. Based on their scores they are put into classes that
meet four hours every day where they are taught English language skills
only in English. The teacher below teaches children classified as “4” by the
test. If a child does better than 4 they are consider proficient in English and
do not need to take the four-hour English language classes. Read the
teacher’s quote and say what you think her situated meaning for “gifted” is.
Why is the teacher using hedges like “pretty” in “pretty advanced,” “pretty
gifted,” “pretty high” and “per se” in “don’t have gifted kids per se”? This
teacher can be seen as creating a situated meaning for “fours.” What is it?
Can one tell whether a child is “gifted” or not by how well they speak a
language they don’t yet fully know? Do all “gifted” people learn second
languages quickly? How are the situated meanings this teacher is creating
for “gifted,” “pretty gifted,” “pretty high,” and “fours” related to an implicit
contrast she is drawing to kids who scored lower on the test (and, thus,
aren’t in her classroom)?
They’re fours. So they’re pretty advanced actually. They’re pretty gifted, not
gifted. I don’t have any gifted kids per se, but I think they’re pretty high. Like
just when we were sorting out the whole second grade, they’re pretty high. They
have a lot of their basic phonics and they’ve been reading their books pretty well
in the second grade text. [Data from: Heineke, A. J. (2009). Teacher’s discourse

4.4 The Social Languages Tool
People do not speak any language “in general.” They always speak a specific
variety of a language (which might actually mix together more than one
language, e.g., English and Spanish) and they use different varieties in different
contexts. There are social and regional varieties of language that are called
“dialects” (see Section 1.1), such as African-American Vernacular English,
Appalachian Vernacular English, or different working class varieties of English
in different parts of the United States. However, we are going to concentrate
here on what I will call “social languages” (many linguists use the term
“register” in a somewhat similar way).
To understand what a speaker says, a listener needs to know who is
speaking. But it is not enough to know, for example, that Mary Smith is the
speaker. I need to know what identity Mary is speaking out of. Is she speaking
to me as a teacher, a feminist, a friend, a colleague, an avid bird watcher, a
political liberal, or a great many other possible identities or roles?
Listeners need to know who speakers are. Is my doctor saying I look
“stressed” just as a friend or is he speaking as a doctor? When the policeman
says “I think you should move your car” is she speaking as a policeman and
ordering me to move the car or speaking as a helpful fellow citizen giving me
advice?
I will define social languages as styles or varieties of a language (or a mixture
of languages) that enact and are associated with a particular social identity. All
languages, like English or French, are composed of many (a great many)
different social languages. Social languages are what we learn and what we
speak. Here are some examples of social languages: the language of medicine,
literature, street gangs, sociology, law, rap, or informal dinner-time talk
among friends.
Even within these large categories there are sub-varieties. Not all types of
gangs or sociologists speak the same when they are speaking as gang members
or sociologists. To know any specific social language is to know how its
characteristic lexical and grammatical resources are combined to enact specific
socially-situated identities (that is, being, at a given time and place, a lawyer,
a gang member, a politician, a literary humanist, a bench chemist, a radical
feminist, an everyday person, or whatever). To know a particular social
language is either to be able to “do” a particular identity or to be able to
recognize such an identity, when we do not want to or cannot actively
participate.
Dialects can be seen as social languages as well. Southern English is a way
to mark oneself as a southerner. African-American Vernacular English is a
way to mark oneself as an African-American of a certain sort (at a certain time
and place).
Let me give two examples, both of which we have seen earlier. First, a
young woman, telling the same story to her parents and to her boyfriend, says 
 Theoretical Tools 163
to her parents at dinner: “Well, when I thought about it, I don’t know, it
seemed to me that Gregory should be considered the most offensive character,”
but later to her boyfriend she says: “What an ass that guy was, you know, her
boyfriend.” In the first case, she uses distinctive lexical and grammatical
resources to enact “a dutiful and intelligent daughter having dinner with her
proud parents” and in the other case to enact “a girlfriend being intimate with
her boyfriend.”
Note, by the way, that the particular labels I use here are not important.
Many social languages have no names and names need not be used by people
overtly. People who use a given social language may differ on what they call
it. The point just is that people must have some, however tentative, unspoken,
and sometimes problematic, idea of who is speaking in the sense of what
social identity is at play.
Second, to take an example from Myers 1990 book Writing Biology: Texts in
the social construction of scientific knowledge, an example which we saw in
Sections 3.16 and 3.17, a biologist writing in a professional science journal
writes: “Experiments show that Heliconius butterflies are less likely to oviposit
on host plants that possess eggs or egg-like structures”; writing about the
same thing in a popular science magazine, the same biologist writes:
“Heliconius butterflies lay their eggs on Passiflora vines.” The first passage
uses distinctive lexical and grammatical resources to enact “a professional
adaptationist biologist of a certain type engaged in managing uncertainty
through the manipulation of theory and experiment”; the second passage uses
distinctive lexical and grammatical resources to enact “a highly trained
observer looking at animals and plants in nature.”
Within any social language, as the speaker acts out a particular type of
who—a particular socially-situated identity—the speaker must also make
clear what he or she is doing, what action or activity, appropriate to that
identity, he or she is carrying out. Listeners need to know not only who is
talking but what they are seeking to accomplish. So speakers always use social
languages to enact specific actions or activities as well.
For example, a listener needs to know if a doctor who says “Have you been
stressed lately” is asking a diagnostic question as a doctor or showing concern
(or even just making “small talk”) as a friend. If a policeman says “I think you
should move your car” I need to know if she is giving me a polite but official
order or just offering helpful advice as a fellow but well informed citizen. If a
professor asks a student “What does ‘democracy’ mean?,” the student needs to
know if this is “test” (and the answer has to be the one the professor thinks is
correct) or a request for an considered opinion that might further class
discussion. We need to know both who is speaking and what they are doing.
Each social language has its own distinctive grammar. However, two
different sorts of grammars are important to social languages, only one of
which we ever think to study formally in school. One grammar is the traditional
set of units like nouns, verbs, inflections, phrases and clauses. These are real 
 164 Theoretical Tools
enough, though quite inadequately described in traditional school grammars.
Let’s call this “grammar 1.”
The other—less studied, but more important—grammar is the “rules” by
which grammatical units like nouns and verbs, phrases and clauses, are used
to create patterns which signal or “index” characteristic social identities and
social activities. That is, we speakers and writers design our oral or written
utterances to have patterns in them in virtue of which interpreters can attribute
situated identities and specific activities to us and our utterances. We will call
this “grammar 2.”
These patterns are called “collocational patterns.” This means that various
sorts of grammatical devices “co-locate” with each other. The patterns I am
trying to name here are “co-relations” (correlations) among many grammatical
devices, from different “levels” of grammar 1. For example, in Jane’s utterance
to her boyfriend, “What an ass that guy was, you know, her boyfriend,” note
how informal terms like “ass” and “guy,” the vague reference “that guy,” the
informal parenthetical device “you know,” and the informal syntactic device
of “right dislocation” (i.e., letting the phrase “her boyfriend” hang out at the
end of the sentence) all pattern together to signal that this utterance is in an
informal social language used to achieve solidarity.
The situation here is much like choosing clothes that go together in such a
way that they communicate that we are engaged in a certain activity or are
taking up a certain style connected to such activities. For example, consider
how flip-flops, bathing suit, tank top, shades, and sun hat “co-locate” together
to “signal” to us things like outdoor and water activities and the situated
identities we take up in such situations.
To see another example of how different word choices and grammatical
structures pattern together to signal a given social language, consider the two
sentences below:
1. Hornworms sure vary a lot in how well they grow.
2. Hornworm growth displays a significant amount of variation.
The first sentence is a vernacular style of language, a vernacular social
language. Everyone who is a native speaker of English, regardless of their
dialect, can utter some equally good variant of this sort of sentence (if they
know what hornworms are—green caterpillar-like creatures with yellow
horns).
The second sentence is in an academic social language. While every native
speaker’s grammar contains all the grammatical structures that this sentence
contains (e.g., nominalizations), not every speaker knows that combining them
in just this way is called for by certain social practices of certain academic (and
school-based) domains (what we will later call “Discourses”). This has to be
learned and this knowledge is not acquired on the basis of any biological
capacity for language, as is our knowledge of the vernacular. It is manifestly 
 Theoretical Tools 165
the case that many children in school struggle to acquire forms of language
like that in sentence 2, though none (if they are native speakers) struggle with
the forms of language like that in sentence 1.
Again, every native speaker of English has a grammar that contains all of
the sorts of grammatical structures that are used in sentence 2. All of them are
used at times in vernacular forms of language. However, to produce a sentence
like 2 you must know more than this. You must know that, in this style of
language, verbs naming dynamic processes (e.g., “grow” and “vary”) are often
turned into nouns naming abstract things (e.g., “growth” and “variation”).
You have to know that in this form of language emotive markers like “sure”
are not used. You have to know that in this form of language a vague phrase
like “a lot” must be replaced by a more explicit one like “significant variation”
(where “significant” has a fairly precise definition in areas like biology). You
have to know that subjects of sentences in this form of language will very
often not be simple nouns (like “hornworms”), but nominalizations (like
“hornworm growth”) expressing a whole clause worth of information (i.e.,
hornworms grow) as an abstract concept. And most importantly you have to
know all these things together and that these linguistic features, in fact, tend to go
together—to pattern together—in this form of language.
The term “social language” applies to specific varieties of language used to
enact specific identities and carry out specific sorts of practices or activities. A
single written or oral text can be in one social language or it can switch
between two or more or even mix them up pretty thoroughly.
For example, consider the warning on an aspirin bottle that you saw in
Section 3.7:
Warnings: Children and teenagers should not use this medication for chicken pox or
flu symptoms before a doctor is consulted about Reye Syndrome, a rare but serious
illness reported to be associated with aspirin. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach
of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact
a poison control center immediately. As with any drug, if you are pregnant or
nursing a baby, seek the advice of a health professional before using this product.
IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT NOT TO USE ASPIRIN DURING THE LAST 3
MONTHS OF PREGNANCY UNLESS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED TO DO SO BY
A DOCTOR BECAUSE IT MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS IN THE UNBORN CHILD
OR COMPLICATIONS DURING DELIVERY. See carton for arthritis use+ and
Important Notice.
There are two different social languages or varieties of language in this
warning. The first is made up of the following sentences:
Children and teenagers should not use this medication for chicken pox or flu symptoms
before a doctor is consulted about Reye Syndrome, a rare but serious illness reported to
be associated with aspirin. IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT NOT TO USE ASPIRIN
DURING THE LAST 3 MONTHS OF PREGNANCY UNLESS SPECIFICALLY 
 166 Theoretical Tools
DIRECTED TO DO SO BY A DOCTOR BECAUSE IT MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS IN
THE UNBORN CHILD OR COMPLICATIONS DURING DELIVERY.
Here things are referred to quite specifically (“children or teenagers,” “this
medication,” “chicken pox,” “flu,” “Reye Syndrome,” “aspirin,” “last 3
months,” “unborn child,” “delivery”), doctors are called “doctor,” and matters
are treated emphatically (italics, capitals, “should not,” “rare but serious,”
“especially important,” “specifically directed”).
The second social language is made up of the following sentences, placed in
the middle of the other two:
Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose,
seek professional assistance or contact a poison control center immediately. As
with any drug, if you are pregnant or nursing a baby, seek the advice of a health
professional before using this product.
Here things are referred to more generally and generically (“this and all
drugs,” “any drug,” and “this product,” rather than “this medication” and
“aspirin”; “children” rather than “children and teenagers,” “pregnant” rather
than “last 3 months of pregnancy”), doctors are not mentioned, rather the
health profession is referred to more generally (“professional assistance,”
“poison control center,” “health professional”), and matters are treated less
stridently with the exception of the word “immediately” (here we get small
print and the less strident phrases “keep out of reach,” “accidental overdose,”
“seek ... assistance,” “seek advice,” rather than the more direct “should not”
and “important not to use” of the other part of the warning).
These two social language “feel” different. They are authorized and issued
by different “voices” to different purposes and effects. The first speaks with a
lawyerly voice responding to specific potential legal problems and court cases;
the second speaks with the official voice of a caring, but authoritatively
knowledgeable company trying to protect and advise people, especially
women and children, while still stressing that aspirin is not particularly special
or dangerous compared to drugs in general.
Of course, this second social language sits in some tension with the first. By
the way, the second social language on the aspirin bottle used to be the only
warning on the bottle (with the order of the sentences a bit different). And,
indeed, the warning has changed yet again on newer bottles.
This warning, like all utterances, reflects the company it has kept, or, to put
the matter another way, it reflects a history that has given rise to it. In this
case, presumably, the new sterner, more direct social language was added to
the more general and avuncular one because the company got sued over things
like Reye’s syndrome.
The warning on the aspirin bottle is heteroglossic. That is, it is “doublevoiced,” since it interleaves two different social languages together. Of course, 
 Theoretical Tools 167
in different cases, this sort of interleaving could be much more intricate, with
the two (or more) social languages more fully integrated, and harder to tease
apart.
We can now state the second of our theoretical tools, The Social Languages
Tool:
Tool #24: Social Languages Tool:
For any communication, ask how it uses words and grammatical structures
(types of phrases, clauses, and sentences) to signal and enact a given social
language. The communication may mix two or more social languages or switch
between two or more. In turn, a social language may be composed of words or
phrases from more than one language (e.g., it may mix English and Spanish).

4.5 Working with the Social Languages Tool
Problem 38
The text below is from a published article in a journal on child development.
Read it and think about how what sort of social language and identity this text
represents.
The present study sought to clarify and extend previous work suggesting that
physically abused children develop perceptual sensitivity to anger. First, we sought
to further examine the ways in which physically abused children can regulate
attentional processes when confronted with anger or threat. Second, because prior
research suggested that physically abused children would be especially sensitive to
anger, the anger-related stimuli presented to the children occurred in the background
and were irrelevant to the child’s purported task and not personally meaningful.
This created a relatively conservative test of children’s attentional regulation. The
present data suggest that once anger was introduced, abused children maintained a 
 168 Theoretical Tools
state of anticipatory monitoring of the environment. In contrast, non-abused
children were initially more aroused by the introduction of anger, but showed better
recovery to baseline states once anger was resolved. (Pollak, S. D., Vardi, S., Putzer
Bechner, A. M., and Curtin, J. J. (2005). Physically abused children’s regulation of
attention in response to hostility.” Child Development 76.5: 968–77—see p. 974)
Questions:
1. List some of the features in terms of word choice, grammatical structures, and
patterns of grammatical structures that make this a distinctive social language.
2. This type of language is often referred to as “academic language.”
However, there are many different varieties of academic language (e.g.,
physics, sociology, linguistics, etc.). How would you characterize the
academic area this social language is connected to?
3. What is the situated meaning of the phrase “not purposefully meaningful”
in the text? Are their senses (situated meanings) of “personally
meaningful” in which anger, even if not expressed directly at them, could
be “personally meaningful” to a child who has been physically abused by
angry parents (as were these children)?
4. How would you characterize the identity that the authors of this text are
enacting or expressing through this social language?
Problem 39
In Section 3.13 we looked at data from an interview with a middle-school
teacher. As we said earlier, this teaches lives in a town that is a former bluecollar industrial town that has lost a good deal of its industry and is in a poor
economic condition. There are not a lot of jobs and those that still do exist
often no longer carry good wages and medical benefits. Many of the parents in
the town—Black or Hispanic—work more than one job to make ends meet
and there is high unemployment.
The teacher was asked about whether she ever discussed social issues with
her students. A part of her response is reprinted below. In the transcript, “I”
stands for “Interviewer.” Words in brackets are guesses about what she said
when it cannot be well heard on the tape. “[????]” means material is inaudible.

Questions:
1. Much of the language of this data, at least in terms of word choice, is in the
teacher’s vernacular English. While some university academics who had been
interviewed in the same study often answered the questions in academic
forms of language or mixtures of academic language and the vernacular, this
teacher stays pretty close to the vernacular. Yet she uses a certain style of
speaking—uses patterns of words and grammar—that are pretty distinctive.
Her style is a form of “teacher talk” in this town. She and other teachers in
this town often used this style. So this is really not just her vernacular. How
would you characterize this social language—point to specific stylistic
features the teacher uses. What do you think the function of this style of
language is? What is the teacher trying to say and do by speaking this way?
2. The university academics we interviewed often based what they said on
the authority of their disciplines, which is why they often used academic
language in the interviews when they were asked social and political
questions. What is the source of the teacher’s authority for the things she
says in the communication above?
3. What is the situated meaning of “the low income things” in the
communication above?
4. How would you characterize the identity this teacher is enacting or
expressing through this social language?

4.6 The Intertextuality Tool
When we speak or write, we often quote or allude to what others have said.
Here I will use the word “text” in a special way to mean what someone has
said or written, a stretch of speech or writing. When one text (in this sense)
quotes, refers to, or alludes to another text (that is, what someone else has said
or written), we will call this “intertextuality.” We can expand this to cover
references or allusions to media (television, film, video games, etc.), treating
these as “texts” too.
There are obviously lots of ways one text can quote, refer to, or allude to
another one. One way is direct quotation as in “It’s funny that Bob said ‘I’ll
never give up’ and then gave up.” Another way is indirect quotation as in “It’s
funny that Bob said he would never give up and then gave up.” Yet another
way is just to allude what hearers or readers in the know will realize are words
taken from some other source as in “Even if life is sweet sorrow, I prefer it to
the alternative,” where “sweet sorrow” echoes a quote from Shakespeare:
“love is such sweet sorrow.” If I say that “When John fought with the boss, it
was David against Goliath,” the mere mention of David and Goliath is enough
(again, for people who know the reference) to make reference to the Biblical
story where the young David defeats the giant Goliath with his sling shot.
Here my speech (my “text”) has alluded to (made an intertextual reference to)
a Biblical text.
Another type of intertextuality occurs when a text written in one style (in
one social language associated with one identity) incorporates a style of
language (a social language) associated with a different identity. For example,
Wired magazine once printed a story with this title: “The New Face of the
Silicon Age: Tech jobs are fleeing to India faster than ever. You got a problem
with that?” (February 2004). The sentence “You got a problem with that?”
reminds us of “tough guy” talk we have heard in many movies or read in
books. It intrigues us that such talk occurs in a magazine devoted to technology
and otherwise written in popular culture high-tech magazine style.
Finally, one text can refer or allude to another text or style of language
(social language) by using or mimicking the grammar or phrasing, but not
necessarily the words, of another text or style of language. For example, I
could write a letter in Biblical sorts of prose or in iambic pentameter verse
thereby making reference to the Bible or traditional English poetry, but with
very different content.
 172 Theoretical Tools
Thus, we can state another tool for discourse analysis:
Tool #25: The Intertextuality Tool:
For any communication, ask how words and grammatical structures (e.g., direct
or indirect quotation) are used to quote, refer to, or allude to other “texts” (that
is, what others have said or written) or other styles of language (social
languages).

4.7 Working with the Intertextuality Tool
In this section you will work with the intertextuality tool. Here you will be
looking for any “echoes” of any sort in one text to another, whether these be
as direct as quotation or as indirect as allusion. You also want to ask how
intertextuality is used to engage in our various building tasks.

Consider the data below from an article about sports (the World Series in
baseball) on the internet (the author is talking about the New York Yankees
beating the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2009 World Series):
Sometimes Goliath wins, or, if you prefer the most appropriate analogy after
World Series Game 6, Godzilla kicks butt.

Questions:
1. Find and discuss all the intertextual references here. What is being
referred to? What function or role does each such reference play in the
data? [By the way “crapshoot” is in “scare quotes.” If you do not know
what scare quotes are, look it up. Why is “crapshoot” in scare quotes?
Some editors do not approve of scare quotes. Why do you think that is?]
2. Why does it seems sports reporting in newspapers and in other popular
media (e.g., television) is so prone to the sorts of intertextual references
in the data below?
3. If you do not follow baseball, sports, or U.S. sports, pair up with someone
who does and ask whether an “insider” gets more in terms of intertextual
references or what they mean or are doing in this data than does someone
who is an “outsider.”
4. Find other examples of intertextuality in sports writing or reporting. It
would be interesting to compare writing about different sports or about
sports in different countries in this regard.

4.8 The Figured Worlds Tool
Is the Pope a bachelor? Though the Pope is an unmarried man—and “bachelor”
as a word is defined as “an unmarried man”—we are reluctant to call the Pope
a bachelor. Why? The reason is that we do not use words just based on their
definitions or what we called earlier (see Section 4.2) their “general meanings.”
We use words based, as well, on stories, theories, or models in our minds
about what is “normal” or “typical.”
It is typical in our world that men marry women. A man who is somewhat
past the typical age when people marry we call a “bachelor,” assuming he is
open to marriage but has either chosen to wait or has not found the “right”
person. The Pope is both well past the normal age for marriage and has vowed
never to marry. He just does not fit the typical story in our heads.
We use words based on such typical stories unless something in the context
makes us think the situation is not typical. If the issue of gay marriage or the
chauvinism of calling men “bachelors” and women “spinsters” comes up, then
we have to think more overtly about matters and abandon, if only for the time,
our typical picture. Indeed, things can change in society enough that what
counts as a typical story changes or becomes contested. People may even stop
using words like “bachelor” based on the typical story and form a new typical
story—and, thus, start calling marriage-eligible women “bachelors” as well.
We use such typical pictures so that we can go on about the business of
communicating, acting, and living without having to consciously think about
everything—all the possible details and exceptions—all the time. This is good
for getting things done, but sometimes bad in the ways in which such typical 
 Theoretical Tools 175
stories can marginalize people and things that are not taken as “normal” or
“typical” in the story.
What counts as a typical story for people differs by their social and culture
groups. For example, some parents confronted by a demanding two-year-old
who angrily refuses to go to bed take the child’s behavior as sign of growth
towards autonomy because they accept a typical story like this: Children are
born dependent on their parents and then grow towards individual autonomy
or independence. On their way to autonomy, they act out, demanding
independence, when they may not yet be ready for it, but this is still a sign of
development and growth. Other parents confronted by the same behavior take
the behavior as a sign of the child’s willfulness because they accept a typical
story like this: Children are born selfish and need to be taught to think of
others and collaborate with the family rather than demand their own way.
It is, perhaps, not surprising that this latter typical story is more common
among working class families where mutual support among family and friends
is important. The former story is more common among middle and uppermiddle-class families with many more financial resources where people are
expected to grow into adults who have the resources to go it more on their
own.
Such typical stories are not “right” or “wrong.” For example, children are,
of course, born dependent on their parents. But are children primarily
inherently selfish and in need of being taught how to cooperate with others or
are they inherently reliant on caregivers and in need of learning to be
independent? The different stories we discussed are probably both true in
some sense, but one or the other can be stressed and help form the main
parenting style in the home. They are simplified theories of the world that are
meant to help people go on about the business of life when one is not allowed
the time to think through and research everything before acting. Even theories
in science are simplified views of the world meant to help scientists cope,
without having to deal with the full complexity of the world all at once.
These typical stories have been given many different names. They have
been called “folk theories,” “frames,” “scenarios,” “scripts,” “mental models,”
“cultural models,” “social models,” “discourse models,” and “figured worlds”
(and each of these terms has its own nuances). Such typical stories are stored
in our heads (but we will see in a moment that they are not always only in our
heads) in the form of images, metaphors, and narratives.
We will use the term “figured world” here for these typical stories. The term
“figured world” has been defined in Dorothy Holland’s influential 1998 book,
written with several colleagues, Identity and agency in cultural worlds, as
follows:
A socially and culturally constructed realm of interpretation in which particular
characters and actors are recognized, significance is assigned to certain acts, and
particular outcomes are valued over others. Each is a simplified world populated 
 176 Theoretical Tools
by a set of agents who engage in a limited range of meaningful acts or changes of
state as moved by a specific set of forces. (p. 52)
A figured world is a picture of a simplified world that captures what is taken
to be typical or normal. What is taken to be typical or normal, as we have said,
varies by context and by people’s social and cultural group (as we saw in the
example of acting out two-year-olds above). For example, if I ask you to
imagine a suburban bedroom you will populate the room with people and
things in a quite different way than if I ask you to imagine a bedroom in a
college dorm. You base what you take to be typical on your experiences and
since people’s experiences vary in terms of their social and cultural groups,
people vary in what they take to be typical. And, again, as society changes
what people take as typical can and does change. Figured worlds are not static.
To give another example, consider the figured world (or typical story) that
might arise in someone’s mind if they think about an elementary school
classroom: Typical participants include one teacher (a female) and a group of
kids of roughly the same age and some support staff including teachers who
help kids with special problems (e.g., learning disabilities, reading problems,
or who are learning English as a second language), sometimes by pulling them
out of the classroom. The kids are sitting in desks in rows facing the teacher,
who is doing most of the talking and sometimes asks the kids questions to
which she knows the answers. There are activities like filling our sheets of
paper with math problems on them. There are regular tests, some of them
state standardized tests. There is an institution surrounding the teacher that
includes a principal and other teachers as well as curriculum directors and
mandates from officials. Parents are quasi “outsiders” to this institution. There
are labels for individual kids, labels such as “SPED” (special education), “LD”
(learning disabled), and “ESL” (English as a Second Language).
This figured world—with its typical participants, activities, forms of
language, and object and environments—is, of course, realized in many actual
classrooms. However there are many exceptions, as well, but they do not
normally come to mind when we think and talk about schools. In fact, every
aspect of this figured world is heavily contested in one or more current school
reform efforts (e.g. age grading, lots of testing, skill sheets, too much teacher
talk, children in rows, etc.). The taken-for-granted nature of the figured world,
however, often stands in the way of change. Reforms just do not seem “normal”
or “right” or “the ways things should be.” For example, today it is not
uncommon that young children can teach adults things about digital
technology, but the child teaching and the teacher learning violates our typical
story. It also violates the values and structures of authority this typical story
incorporates.
I have said that these typical stories—what we are calling figured worlds—
are in our heads. But that is not strictly true. Often they are partly in our heads
and partly out in the world in books and other media and in other people’s 
 Theoretical Tools 177
heads, people we can talk to. The figured world in which children are born
dependent and development is progress towards individual autonomy and
independence as eventual adults who can manage their own lives based on
their own resources is a model that is found in lots of child-raising self-help
books and in the talk and actions of many parents who are professionals (e.g.,
doctors, lawyers, professors, executives, and so forth) with whom we can
interact if we live in the right neighborhood.
Thus, we can state out third theoretical tool, the Figured World Tool. It is
clear that this tool is related to the Filling In Tool, since assumptions about
shared figured worlds is a part of context and what speakers assume listeners
will be able to fill in:
Tool #26: Figured World Tool
For any communication, ask what typical stories or figured worlds the words
and phrases of the communication are assuming and inviting listeners to
assume. What participants, activities, ways of interacting, forms of language,
people, objects, environments, and institutions, as well as values, are in these
figured worlds?
In Section 3.10 we discussed a foreign doctoral student in graduate school in
the United States who has, after several years in the program, lost her PhD
advisor. She needed to get another one. She was talking to a professor who she
wanted as an advisor, but who was reluctant to take her on as a student. She
said: “It’s your job to help me, I need to learn.” While we talked about this
utterance in terms of the Relationships Building Tool, we can also see a conflict
of figured worlds here.
The student was using a figured world of the relationship between professors
and students in which professors were in a helping profession and the students
were the ones they helped. In this figured world there are helpers who have
the skill to help and who are obligated to help if someone needs their help.
The more in need of help the person is, the more the helper is morally and
professionally obligated to help. This figured world fits some professions (e.g.,
doctors, nurses, teachers) better than it does others (e.g., professional sports,
accountants, bookies). And since all figured worlds are oversimplified, it does
not always actually fit well the professions for which it is a best fit (e.g.,
doctors and hospitals who will not treat poor people who are sick).
The professor’s figured world of the relationship between professors and
students was different, perhaps based on his own graduate education and his
years in the profession. He saw the professor as training students who are
already well on their way to being professionals and who, if they succeeded as
researchers themselves, would be his legacy. The relationship was mutually
beneficial. This is not an uncommon model for professors in disciplines like 
 178 Theoretical Tools
physics, say, though professors in education (and in ESL) sometimes do adopt
the helping profession model.
The conflict in the student and professor’s figured worlds could best have
been resolved if it had risen to consciousness and been overtly discussed.
Then the student could have had the opportunity to rephrase her request or
the professor could have rethought the role of helping in his profession. But
figured worlds (typical stories of how things typically are in the world) are
usually unconscious and taken-for-granted. It can be an important strategy for
people to seek to understand them better and bring them to overt attention
when there are conflicts in communication.

4.9 Working with the Figured Worlds Tool
Figured worlds are “theories” or models or pictures that people hold about
how things work in the world when they are “typical” or “normal.” We all
hold a myriad of such figured worlds. We all use them so that we do not have
to consciously think about everything before we talk and act. The best way to
get at what figured worlds a speaker is assuming in a given context is to ask
the following question: What must this speaker assume about the world—
take to be typical or normal—in order to have spoken this way, to have said
these things in the way they were said? Often interviewing people is a good
way to uncover figured worlds (e.g., people’s assumptions about what typical
schools and schooling look like).
Because figured worlds deal in what is taken as typical or normal, they can
sometimes become means to judge and discriminate against people who are
taken as untypical or not normal. Often the sense of typical or normal that is
captured in a figured world lapses over into a notion of what is “appropriate”
or “good.”

Problem 44
Below are two excerpts from interviews or working men in Rhode Island from
Claudia Strauss’s important 1992 paper “What makes Tony run?” (see Reading
at end of this Section for citation). Reflect on the data and answer the questions
below.
I believe if you put an effort into anything, you can get ahead. ... If I want to
succeed, I’ll succeed. It has to be, come from within here. Nobody else is going to
make you succeed but yourself... And, if anybody disagrees with that, there’s
something wrong with them. (p. 202)
[The worker is discussing the workers’ fight against the company’s proposal
mandating Sunday work] But when that changed and it was negotiated through a
contract that you would work, so you had to change or keep losing that eight
hours pay. With three children, I couldn’t afford it. So I had to go with the flow
and work the Sundays. (p. 207)
Questions:
1. State the figured world (the picture of the world or a story about the
world each speaker takes for granted as expressing what is “typical” or
“normal”; how the speaker assumes “things work” in the world) expressed
in each excerpt. How do they differ?
2. The figured world or cultural model expressed in the first excerpt has
been called “the success model” and is held by a great many people in the
United States. The figured world or cultural model expressed in the
second excerpt has been called “the good provider model.” Strauss found
that the working class men she interviewed held both models, though
they were often in conflict in their lives. When their lives did not lead to
success (often because they had chosen to support their families over
their own interests as individuals) in larger societal terms (e.g., having to
do with things like income) who do you think they blamed?
3. Strauss found that upper-middle-class men often sacrificed the needs of
their families when they moved in order to take better jobs in order to
achieve success. Why do you think they did this? She found that the
working class men she interviewed did not do this and sometimes gave up
promotions and new job opportunities rather than harm their families
other interests. Why do you think they did this?
Problem 45
In Section 3.15 you worked with some data from a college professor being
interviewed about her views on race in society. This data is reprinted below.
Though this speaker is using academic language, there are, of course, still 
 180 Theoretical Tools
figured worlds at play in her talk. Indeed, these figured worlds are influenced
by her academic discipline, but also carry over into her views of the world
around her in her own town.
When academic disciplines develop theories of the world, especially in the
social sciences, they are like figured worlds, but usually more explicit and we
hope more open to evidence and falsification. We call them “theories” (but,
remember, theories are themselves simplified views of the world used to help
us understand the world better by leaving aside some of its complexity).
It is, of course, possible that an academic discipline claims that something
is a theory that really just replicates the figured worlds of some group of
people in society. This most certainly happened in psychology when
psychologists in the first half of the twentieth century claimed, often in
textbooks, that African-Americans were inferior to Whites and women inferior
to men in many respects.
The speaker’s reference to different levels of reality is a core theme of much
work in the social sciences. The distinction between the “macro” level (the
level of institutions and large social trends) and the “micro” level (the level of
human social interactions) has been deeply important to the social sciences.
At the same time it is a major problem in the social sciences as to how to
understand the relationship between the macro level and the micro level. Do
larger institutional and social forces cause individuals’ social actions and
interactions or are larger institutional and social forces simply made up of
these social actions and interactions? There are important questions here. We
are concerned in analyzing the data below in the uses the speaker makes of
“levels.”
Reflect on the data and then answer the questions below.
Interviewer: . . . How, do you see racism happening, in society, let’s put it that
way.
1. Um, well, I could answer on, on a variety of different levels // [I: uh huh]
2. Um, at the most macro level /
3. Uum, I think that there’s um, um /
4. I don’t want to say this in a way that sounds like a conspiracy / [I: mm hm]
5. But I think um, that um, basically that the lives of people of color are are, are
irrelevant to the society anymore // [I: mm hm]
6. Um, they’re not needed for the economy because we have the third world to
run away into for cheap labor // [I: uh huh]
7. Um, and I think that, that the leadership /
8. This country really doesn’t care if they shoot each other off in in the ghettos
/ [I: uh huh]
9. Um, and, and so they let drugs into the ghettos /
10. And they, um, they, let people shoot themselves /
11. Shoot each other /
12. And they don’t have, a police force that is really gonna, um, work /
13. And they cut the programs that might alleviate some of the problems //
14. And, um—
 Theoretical Tools 181
15. So I think there’s /
16. That it’s manifested at, at the most, structural level as, um, you know, a real
hatred, of, of, of uh people of color //[I: uh huh]
17. And, and it’s shown, in, the cutbacks and so forth //
18. And, um, I think that um, that, it’s, it’s reflected in, in the fact that, they’re,
they’re viewed as, expendable / [I: mm hm]
19. By our leadership //
20. Um, and so I think, I see cutbacks in programs as just a, an example of, of a
broader/ [I: mm hm]
21. You know, sense, that, that, from the point of view of, of those in power /
22. People of color are expendable / [I: uh huh]
23. And, and irrelevant //
Questions:
1. State the basic figured world this speaker is using in terms of how people,
activities, institutions, and environments function in this picture of the
world (e.g., Who or what are the actors and what do they do?).
2. Would you call the picture of the world behind this speaker’s
communication here a “theory” or a “figured world” (which are theories
or pictures of the world that are more tacit, taken-for-granted and often
more simplified than academic theories) or some of both?
3. What is the situated meaning of the phrase “people of color” here (e.g.,
consider the use of the word “ghetto”). Who are being taken as typical
“people of color”? Why?
4. Can you think of figured worlds (picture of the world) that some people
might hold that would be quite different than the one expressed by the
speaker above? Who might these people be and why would they hold a
different model?
5. What would social activism look like if one accepts the figured world
expressed by this speaker? What are some different figured worlds an
activist for causes concerned with poverty and equity in society might
assume as a starting point?

4.10 The Big D Discourse Tool
People talk and act not just as individuals, but as members of various sorts of
social and cultural groups. We do not invent our language, we inherit it from
others. We understand each other because we share conventions about how to 
 182 Theoretical Tools
use and interpret language. We can most certainly innovate within these
conventions—create new words, give new situated meanings to words, find
new ways of saying things—but these innovations must be shared with others
in order to be understood and to survive. Furthermore, our innovations are
carried out against the background of shared conventions about how to use
and interpret language.
The social groups with which we share conventions about how to use and
interpret language are many and varied. These groups include cultures; ethnic
groups; professions like doctors, lawyers, teachers, and carpenters; academic
disciplines; interest-driven groups like bird watchers and video gamers; and
organizations like street gangs, the military, and sports teams. There are yet
many other sorts of social groups. Each of them has distinctive ways with
words associated with distinctive identities and activities.
There is no one word for all these sorts of groups within which we humans
act out distinctive identities and activities. People have tried various names for
them: “cultures” (broadening the term), “communities of practice,” “speech
communities,” “discourse communities,” “activity systems,” “actor-actant
networks,” and others. Each label is meant to capture just some such groups
or just some aspects of such groups.
I will use the term “Discourse” with a capital “D” (so-called “big D
Discourses”). I use this term because such groups continue through time—for
the most part, they were here before we arrived on earth and will be here after
we leave—and we can see them as communicating (discoursing) with each
other through time and history, using us as their temporary mouthpieces.
We introduced the term “social language” earlier for distinctive styles or
varieties of language with which people enact specific socially recognizable
identities and actions or activities. Social languages allow people to speak as
certain types of African-Americans, Anglo-Americans, doctors, soldiers,
gamers, mathematicians, gang members, bird watchers, politicians, or any of
a great many other things. However, when we enact an identity in the world,
we do not just use language all by itself to do this. We use language, but we
also use distinctive ways of acting, interacting with others, believing, valuing,
dressing, and using various sorts of objects and tools in various sorts of
distinctive environments.
If you want to show me you are a basketball player you cannot just talk the
talk, you have to walk the walk and do that with a basketball on a basketball
court in front of other people. If you want to get recognized as a devout Catholic,
you cannot just talk the “right” way about the “right” things, you also have to
engage in certain actions (like going to Mass) with the “right” people (e.g.,
priests) in the “right” places (e.g., church) and you have to display the “right”
sorts of beliefs (e.g., about the virgin birth of Christ from his mother Mary) and
values (e.g., deference to the Pope). The same is true of trying to get recognized
as a “Native American,” a “good student,” a “tough policeman,” or a “competent
doctor.” You need to talk the talk and walk the walk.
 Theoretical Tools 183
A Discourse with a capital “D” (I will use “discourse” with a little “d” just
to mean “language in use” or stretches of oral or written language) is composed
of distinctive ways of speaking/listening and often, too, distinctive ways
writing/reading. These distinctive ways of speaking/listening and/or reading/
writing are coupled with distinctive ways of acting, interacting, valuing,
feeling, dressing, thinking, and believing. In turn, all of these are coupled with
ways of coordinating oneself with (getting in synch with) other people and
with various objects, tools, and technologies. All this is in the service of
enacting specific socially recognizable identities. These identities might be
things like being–doing a Los Angeles Latino street-gang member, a Los
Angeles policeman, a field biologist, a first-grade student in a specific classroom
and school, a “SPED” student, a certain type of doctor, lawyer, teacher,
African-American, Mexican-American, worker in a “quality control”
workplace, man, woman, boyfriend, girlfriend, or regular at the local bar, etc.,
through a nearly endless list.
Discourses are about being “kinds of people.” There are different ways to be
an African-American, Latino, or Anglo. Thus, there are different kinds of
African-Americans or different kinds for any other social or cultural group.
Being a policeman is to act out a kind of person. So is being a “tough cop,”
which is to talk and act as sub-kind of person within the kind of being a
policeman. Being a SPED student (“Special Ed”) is one way to be a kind of
student, it is one kind of student. There are kinds within kinds.
Kinds of people appear in history and some disappear. At one time in
history, in England and the United States, you could be recognized as a witch,
if you talked the talked and walked the walk (and you might in some cases do
so unintentionally). Now it is much harder to get recognized as a witch in
many of the places where it was once much easier, though there are still places
in the world where you can get recognized as a witch. That “kind of person”
has pretty much disappeared in England and the United States.
The whole point of taking about Discourses is to focus on the fact that when
people mean things to each other, there is always more than language at stake.
To mean anything to someone else (or even to myself) I have to communicate
who I am (in the sense of what socially-situated identity am I taking on here
and now). I also have to communicate what I am doing in terms of what
socially-situated activity I am seeking to carry out, since Discourses (being
and doing kinds of people) exist in part to allow people to carry out certain
distinctive activities (e.g., arresting people for a policeman, taking communion
for a Catholic, getting an “A” for a good student).
Language is not enough for this. We have to get our minds and deeds
“right,” as well. We also have to get ourselves appropriately in synch with
various objects, tools, places, technologies, and other people
