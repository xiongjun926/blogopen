  Reciprocally, Boulton was drawn to Watt by friendship but also, tellingly, by ‘love of a money-getting ingenious project’.
  With his boldness and connections, Boulton was the perfect partner for the more retiring Watt.
  This was broadly the path Boulton & Watt followed, albeit with some significant differences.
  They were careful to specify particular suppliers of each part to ensure their high standards were met.
  This complexity dogged Boulton & Watt from the start because of the location of most of their likely customers.
  Boulton & Watt offered an ideal solution to the difficulties faced.
  It might take four or five weeks to complete, and came with attendant risks to the men involved – Boulton wrote home from Cornwall in 1779, ‘Tom Bowden has had two of his fingers burnt one quite broke off James Darlestone james watt 130 his hand much hurt, so that out of seven we have but four that can work.
  Such were the calls on his time and expertise that he wrote to Boulton in February 1778: ‘I fancy I must be cut in pieces and a portion sent to every tribe in Israel.
 .’75 Presently Boulton and Watt appointed William Murdoch as their chief representative in Cornwall, his technical skill and ability to take on fractious Cornish miners with his fists if so required – an option hardly open to the reticent Watt – giving him considerable authority, and freeing Boulton and Watt for other activities.
 .’83 135 gentlemen of merit and ingenuity, 1765–81 Boulton and Watt formed a subsidiary company marketing the press to others; 630 were sold in its first year.
  Despite their best efforts they made very little money from the former: just a few late-arriving components, or a faulty casting, could turn a profitable job into a loss-making one.
  Boulton created what we will call a ‘dispersed factory’, and it was what a business analyst today might call ‘scaleable’: once the basic infrastructure was in place, it could be expanded as circum - stances dictated, without a detrimental effect on Boulton & Watt’s core interests.
  How Boulton & Watt competed, and against whom, will be considered next.
  The early 1780s were busy for Boulton & Watt.
  Watt had great hopes for the wheel, projecting one up to 24 feet in diameter, and Boulton confi- dently predicted, ‘If we had a hundred wheels ready made . . . we could readily dispose of them.
 In total they stood to gain £162,000 (more than £10 million at today’s prices) – the amount they actually received was less, but still enough for Watt to retire from the business on a comfortable income.
 Thus was passed a major milestone in handing over to the company to Boulton & Watt’s successors – their sons.
 Some historians have argued that the authority Boulton & Watt wielded was ‘sufficient to clog engin - eering enterprise for a generation’.
 As one account has styled them, the senior Boulton and Watt were builders, but their sons were organizers.
 This new project brought the organizational talents of the junior Boulton and Watt to the fore.
 This strategy was based on innovation both in products and in the markets where they were sold.
 However, between 1795 and 1825, they built 102 – the majority after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 – and they proved to be highly profitable.
 Watt Junior wrote to Matthew Boulton, complaining that his father did not understand him, ‘never having been a young man himself’.
 He also designed Boulton & Watt’s huge Albion Mill in London and refashioned Matthew Boulton’s Soho House in the Palladian style.
 These, then, suggest that others beyond Boulton & Watt took inspiration from the antique.
 But they (the workmen) stagger’d at the bowl, & did not know which way to set about it.
 Boulton and Watt were too old for this new fashion but their sons were not.
