Contents James Watt’s workshop at his Birmingham home, 1924, just before it was  ismantled and moved to the Science Museum, London.

On the afternoon of 29 December 1924, Edward Collins stood alone, in a large, empty room at the top of a house on the edge of Birmingham.

He also described himself as a ‘one-man job’, with no colleagues, and he had not had a holiday since 1914, ten years earlier.

Answering the question of why Collins felt obliged to collect the dust from the room and send it to the Science Museum in London requires some elaboration.

As it happens, the Science Museum decided against acquiring the dust.

The profusion of projects that Watt undertook is also reflected in the nature of the workshop’s larger objects.

This is a book about making things during Britain’s Industrial Revolution, covering the period roughly from 1760 until 1820.

Recent surveys of the Industrial Revolution have emphasized the creation in Britain of a ‘knowledge economy’, which succeeded because it could generate ‘useful knowledge’ and disseminate it to those who might exploit it commercially.

Having the infrastructure to support the widest possible flow of ideas was no doubt important to Britain’s economy as it indus- trialized during the later eighteenth century.

This is not to deny that scientific knowledge influenced how things were made.

First, however, we have to manoeuvre into a position from which we can see what those other factors could have been.


The answer is not quite as indecipherable as it might appear.

We can go further than this: as well as the sources that Fox draws upon, there exists a huge range of three-dimensional tools, materials and finished artefacts that craftsmen and artisans used and generated in their everyday working lives.

We can use these myriad sources on tools and techniques to delve into the world of making things during the eighteenth century.

Exploring the world of making has two key questions, then.

Artisans worked extensively to identify, acquire and find uses for new materials.

Artisans organized production to work materials into finished products.

Artisans innovated in the techniques used in their manufacturing processes, devising many new ones but often amplifying and re - inventing those that were well-established and applying them under new circumstances to new materials and products.

Lastly, artisans had to find a way to market their finished product.

These five building blocks of making – product, materials, organization, techniques and marketing – suggest that artisans were as much endowed with entrepreneurial and commercial skills as they were with practical ability.

The second key aspect of making things concerns not just the question of ‘how?’, but those of ‘what?’ and ‘why?’, too.

Beyond the innate instinct for technological creativity that motiv - ated these craftsmen and artisans, other factors as well as science influenced the paths that making things would advance along.

The tremendous demand for consumer goods also influenced what products were made.

It was not just the quantity of possessions present in households that changed but their sheer range, the choice of materials and how they were branded, packaged and sold as well.

The third factor influencing which things were made was a widely held fascination with precision.

Finally, the classical world exerted considerable sway on the products that were made.

It is difficult to treat these factors in a linear way.


If you seek his monument, look around you .

Such words quickly consolidated Watt’s reputation as a colossus of Britain’s Industrial Revolution.

The centrality of Watt and his engine has long continued to fascinate historians.

How, then, to carve out a niche in this busy marketplace? The tendency has been to think about Watt in vertical slices: Watt the engineer, craftsman or chemist, or example.

The major issue to be overcome here is avoiding what John Griffiths described as ‘Wattolatry’: the worship of Watt.

Johann Conrad Fischer was a pioneering Swiss steel-maker who made contact with many of England’s eminent industrialists and manufacturers.

What comes across from many of these accounts is the impact of the processes of making, and the products that were created, on the contemporary imagination.

Later commentators agreed, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, who believed the English had successfully ‘impressed their direct-ness and practical habit onto modern civilisation’.

Stand firm my friend, & let us support this threatened attack like Veterans prepar’d for every shock, or change of fortune that can befall us – If we must fall .

This is more blood-and-guts stuff than the abstractions of science, economic theorizing and epistemologies of knowledge that seem to have tied up so much history of the Industrial Revolution: here is a bold new world filled with people, places and objects.

To return to the dust in Watt’s workshop, it represented the long, multifaceted and highly productive career of one man.


The city of London played a pivotal role in James Watt’s early career.

And the German scientist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg had expressed in April 1770 how he ‘could not possibly describe what strange figures’ he saw, ‘half-naked men and women, children, chimney- sweeps, tinkers, Moors and men of letters, fishwives and females in grand array’.

Wapping was a marine community, huddled on the north bank of the Pool of London, the centre of a global shipping network.

The amount of drinking which went on, as recorded in accounts of the time, is amazing.

In short, much of the nation sought to be ‘drunk for a penny, dead drunk for tuppence.

People’s capacity for drinking was matched by their appetite for violence.

Britain in the eighteenth century was, in many respects, a society of extremes.

Watt’s early encounters with this world, his upbringing and training in the rudiments of business offer a valuable insight into the infrastructure that facilitated Britain becoming the world’s first industrial nation.

It was a world which, broadly, didn’t go hungry: Britain could feed itself.

Britain’s population was also growing rapidly – from about 6.

The growing population was also increasingly mobile.

You meet nowhere with those persons who never were out of their native place, and whose habits are wholly local .

And the Romantic poet Robert Southey was struck by how travel ‘is one of the pleasures of the English; and people .

So, eighteenth-century Britain was getting more populous, and its people were increasingly likely to travel in pursuit of work and new opportunities.

Watt was the fourth child for Agnes and James Senior but the first to survive past infancy.

Herbert Bourne after Marcus Stone, Watt’s First Experiment, 1879.

But he was not just content to read, and sought to expand from ideas into practice.

Moving to Glasgow placed Watt at the commercial hub of west- ern Scotland.

Watt Senior traded all sorts of goods around the Clyde.

In fact, his cousin Marion Campbell recalls that while in Glasgow, Watt  et with good society, and formed friendships with several intelligent and well-educated young men; they had frequent evening meetings to give or receive information.

This image of Watt and his young acquaintances offers a glimpse of the webs of contacts which coalesced in so many places across Britain, often based in the new coffee houses that were springing up everywhere.

Watt and his acquaintances would have discussed many of the networks which aided and abetted their everyday lives, from the difficulties of travel to local government.

Lunar Society, the coffee pot sits prominently on the table.

One solution was to build turnpike roads, paid for by users.

If roads sped the passage of relatively portable things like news or ideas, more bulky items went by boat.

Efficient shipping was crucial to the industrializing economy.

The ‘hands-off’ approach of central government was commented on by many overseas visitors, one of whom noted:  Greenock in 1768, by Robert Paul of Glasgow.

Another visitor was relieved that, while travelling around,  o stern examiner comes here to search and inspect us, or our baggage; no imperious guard here demands a sight of our passports; perfectly free and unmolested, we here walk through villages and towns, as unconcerned, as we should walk through an house of our own.

At the local and national level, those representing the state remained accountable for their actions.

The infrastructure of transport and information networks, and the state, provided Britain with her blood vessels and nervous system.

Britain had a strong and durable social hierarchy.

‘Lords Spiritual and Temporal’ at the top, and the bottom comprising j a m e s  w at t labourers, the poor and the destitute.

But while Britain’s social structure was closely defined, it was by no means overly rigid.

Although the cotton entrepreneur Sir Richard Arkwright started out as a wigmaker, for example, the movement  wasn’t just up wards.

The close interplay between the classes facilitated industrial change.

The trend was picked up on by foreign commentators, one of whom noted in 1790 how ‘Mr Boulton of Birmingham, Mr Wedgwood of Etruria .

If Watt and his young merchant friends in Glasgow aspired to ascend the social ladder, they sought to do so by meeting the demands of Britain’s middle classes, the customers for many of the goods they would make and trade.

Consumer spending was to be a motor for commerce and a stimulus for industrial change.

This acquisitive impulse came with some strings attached, however.

First, the tax system was highly regressive – that is, the wealthier you were, the less tax you paid as a proportion of your income.

This, then, was the world Watt found himself entering as a young merchant with his commercial friends in Glasgow.

In many aspects of life an informal code of behaviour sup - plemented the formal laws of the land.

It is against this background that Watt left Scotland for the first time, in June 1755, and travelled to train as a scientific-instrument maker in London.

A basic premise of politeness was to maintain a respectable appear ance.

‘The Mathematical Instrument Maker’, from The Book of Trades (1824).

Respectability went hand-in-hand with trustworthiness.

Morgan, ‘a man of as good a character both for accuracy in his business & good morals as any in his way in London’, was based at Finch Lane in the City, between Cornhill and Threadneedle Street.

He agreed to teach Watt his wide knowledge of both technical and commercial aspects of instrument making.

Morgan’s manners were as important to his commercial persona as his technical ingenuity.

Once Watt had established with associates that he was a respect - able, trustworthy and well-mannered young man, he built his personal network through regular correspondence, letters of introduction and bills of exchange.


The involvement of a third party also characterized bills of exchange.

Finally, letters encouraged a rich flow of information around Britain.

On another level, news of major events spread fast.

Britain, then, reverberated with news and views, bills of exchange and letters of introduction moving with travellers on land and at sea.

Watt’s letters from London record the variety of his training.

By June 1756 Watt was preparing to return to Scotland.

Whenever any puzzle came in the way of any of us, we went to Mr Watt.


1757–64 xcitement of the mob.

Working at Glasgow College, Watt found that his interests were widely shared.

Having learned his trade as an instrument maker, Watt found himself immersed in the Scottish Enlightenment and a new popular culture that was fascinated by science.

As Watt began his career making scientific instruments, he was launching himself into a culture where a vigorous ‘taste for science, over all classes of men, in every nation of Europe .

The market for scientific instruments was multifaceted.

Lecturers occupied a strategic position in promoting science in the wider economy.

Alongside teachers and lecturers, there were others for whom instruments were very much a workaday tool: practitioners like navigators, surveyors and civil engineers.

Instrument makers stood at the intersection between practition- ers’ demands and new scientific discoveries.

It is against this background that Watt took his first steps, not learning his trade, but as a professional instrument maker.

Watt developed a reputation within Glasgow College, then, as the ‘go to’ man for anything that needed making.

I have now had a year’s trial here I am able to form a judgement of what may be made of this business & find that .

He ended gloomily, noting that if his venture failed he would have to ‘fall into some other way of business as this will not do in the present situation’.

Another of Watt’s major products was a machine for drawing in perspective which he developed and sold from 1765.

Watt had set his sights on supplying a bigger market with a focused range of standardized products.

For a long time, instruments were made of wood, but it could be a temperamental material.

Efforts were made to shrink it so it could be made of more durable metal without becoming too heavy.

The quest for high-quality instrument mirrors and lenses simi - larly tested opticians’ ingenuity.

Working brass and glass into precision instruments led to innov - ation in three key areas.

Screw threads – cylinders with an indented spiral running around the outside – were essential to successful precision instruments.

London instrument maker Jesse Ramsden later built a number of special screw-cutting lathes, and their output was used to make fine adjustments in all sorts of instruments – some later threads were employed in measuring devices claiming an accuracy of within one-millionth of an inch.

And, as he had devised ways of cutting screw threads, between 1768 nd 1774 Ramsden also cracked the problem of making scales by machine.

Making the best use of these new materials and techniques determined the organization of the instrument trade.

A consequence of this complex trade structure was that the name engraved on a finished instrument was a ‘brand’ name – that of a businessman and designer in overall charge of the manufac- turing process but responsible for physically making few of the components.

Far from being a solitary craftsman, Watt assembled a team of employees.

Having developed his team, Watt also remained closely linked to the instrument making trade in London.

Both brass and glass can be found in quantities in Watt’s work- shop, and references to many other materials can be traced in his ledgers.

To work these materials, Watt used hand tools extensively and drawer upon drawer of them remain in his workshop.

Many of Watt’s tools can be matched against contemporary descriptions of workshop equipment.

Many of the basic tools are similar, and these are a counter balance to the emphasis on mechanization, lathes and dividing engines in instrument making.

Prominent among Watt’s early specialized tools were printing plates for making the scales on quadrants and other instruments.

Rain/Snow; Much Rain/Much Snow; Stormy’, which is suggestive of the ferocious Glaswegian weather, about which Watt could describe to a friend the ‘100 people I see just now running by wett to the skin, no doubt cursing god in their hearts.

It may also be that these more ingenious techniques are not as novel as they appear at first sight.

Watt’s scriber for making multiple lines at once is a simpler form of what Moxon describes here.

Historian of mechanism Michael Wright has even suggested that one of Watt’s projects appears to have gone subtly wrong.

If Watt’s attempt at constructing a dividing engine went awry, he had more success making screw threads.

A year later, he wrote again to Small, ‘I had occasion to use my last dividing screw for the first time the other day .

The London instrument makers were an acknowledged elite and their capabilities do not necessarily reflect those elsewhere.

But whether Watt’s business demanded that he pursued such a theoretically grounded, precise approach is doubtful.

So for some instrument makers, ‘good enough’ was preferable to ‘the best’, and satisfied their customers.

Concentrating on making instruments that were just good enough did not preclude innovation and awareness of the latest new theories in other areas, however.

There survive objects from Watt’s Glasgow workshop that embody this revolutionary approach – the theory that would underpin the rise of the factory system in Britain.

The range of tools in Watt’s workshop matches closely those needed for flute making as described in Louis Bergeron’s Manuel du Tourneur of 1816.

Watt’s special tool for undercutting three finger holes on a flute at once.

Some of Watt’s pin gauges for marking the positions of finger holes on flutes.

Significant in another way is one final artefact illustrating Watt’s business practices.

Watt wasn’t just making flutes.

But from the heap of unfinished fingerboards in Watt’s workshop, it would appear that Watt saw some promise in the idea and may have been commissioned to make them by Clagget before he obtained his patent.

Watt’s shop strategy reflects the scale of the market for instru- ments that could be used at home.

To launch himself fully into the world of instrument retailing, Watt entered business partnership in October 1759 with John Robert Sayer, Astronomy, c.

Craig, a Glasgow-based merchant and architect.

Watt was following a retail trend already established elsewhere.

You have certainly heard of the richness and brilliance of London shops, but I doubt that you have realised how much Astronomy contributes to the beauty of the spectacle: London has a great number of opticians, their shops are full of reflecting and refracting telescopes, octants, &c.

Shops were places where an astute instrument maker would unashamedly show off his wares: to demonstrate his telescopes, John Marshall had his name painted in white on the roof of a house twenty houses away from the shop, and prospective telescope purchasers were encouraged to spot it.

But Watt’s expanding business empire also shows us how vulnerable an artisan-entrepreneur could be to financial problems and competition.

When the microscope maker John Cuff gave up his London shop because he worked too slowly to sustain the business, he found that even in Norwich there were ‘several persons who sell Optical Instruments of an inferior sort and of late, Riders are imployed .

Looking through the accounts of Watt and Craig’s partnership suggests that the business was not sustainable.

Watt also had competition in Glasgow.

Watt’s foray into the world of instrument making brought mixed results.

In the winter of 1763–4 a model engine was brought to Watt by John Anderson.

Newcomen’s atmospheric engine was simple, robust and reliable.

Watt eventually returned the model to Anderson; he had already sawn its pump casing in half, for example, and even more radical measures than Anderson would have countenanced were needed to make it work to Watt’s satisfaction.

The separate condenser was possibly the greatest single im - provement ever made to the steam engine.

Instrument makers were early on resolving the problems of making artefacts in metal that were as robust as they were accurately made.

Watt was also early in what became a longstanding relationship between instrument makers and steam engines.

Sheffield, 1851.

The Broomielaw Quay was the trading heart of the city of Glasgow.

Glasgow became, then, a prosperous reflection of Scotland’s growing industrial and commercial power.

We have already explored Watt’s instrument making business, and his introduction to the steam engine, within the context of a burgeoning scientific culture.

Scotland’s industrialization, and Watt’s future career.

The Scottish Enlightenment saw close bonds forged between the universities in cities such as Glasgow or Edinburgh, and part- ners in industry.

Anderson’s lectures were in demand because, after 1750, Scotland was home to a broad and strengthening range of industries.

This resilient industrial base provided particularly fertile ground for the application of new philosophical research in chemistry.

William Cullen, distinguished professor at Glasgow and then Edinburgh until 1789, had declared,  Does the joiner want a particular glew [sic]? Does the mason want a cement? Does the dyer want a means of tinging a cloth of a particular colour? Or does the bleacher want the means of discharging all colours? It is the chemical philosopher who must supply these.

But it was Cullen’s student and assistant Joseph Black who most fully devoted himself to building bridges between research and its industrial applications.

Black’s consultancy illustrates the fruitful flow of ideas estab- lished in Scotland between philosophical science and its industrial applications.

Philosophical chemistry and its industrial applications were, then, two sides of the same coin, and Black was at the forefront of a community which encompassed both.

And they also forged links with others like John Roebuck, who had established an industrial plant for making sulphuric acid near Edinburgh in 1749, and James Keir, raised in Scotland but working in England, who turned synthetic alkali manufacture into a commer - cial process for the first time.

This new industry had two key characteristics.

Second, this newfound economic stimulus found physical form in a new culture of consumption.

New consumer goods, as demanded by the denizens of Glasgow and across Britain, were not simply material possessions but signi - fied membership of a new, refined social class defined by prosperity and an awareness of the latest tastes.

It was against this background that James Watt met his wife.

Those possessions that do survive from Watt’s early life – such as a silver George ii ‘skittle ball’ teapot, named after its shape, silver spoons, a sauce boat and mugs – appear mostly to have been inher- ited from his father, who died much later, in 1782.

A first son was born in July 1765, but died aged only four months.

The world around Watt and his family was shaped by increasing prosperity and the rise of a consumer culture which prized material possessions.

Roebuck had attended the lectures given in Glasgow by Joseph Black and was a speculative investor in interests that included acid manufacture, the iron foundry at Carron and coal mining.

Watt’s partnership with Roebuck involved extensive work improv- ing the engine’s design.

With the patent obtained, Watt’s tests on a full-size version of his engine continued at Kinneil until April 1770.

Roebuck wrote to Watt, ‘You are letting the most active part of your life insensibly glide away.

As Roebuck’s coal mines filled with water, and his money seeped away, Watt faced a dilemma.

As we will see, when Watt did grasp the internal workings of the engine, he saw it as a chemical machine.

The scope of Watt’s chemical interests is indicated by the con- tents of his workshop, which is a veritable storehouse of practical chemistry.

This was not a systematic but more an opportunistic approach to chemistry.

That is not to say, however, that Watt’s chemical interests were not philosophical.

The Delftfield Pottery had been established by four business partners in 1748, and was based just west of Glasgow city centre, quite close to the Broomielaw Quay.

There were two possible paths that Watt could pursue: to make Chinese porcelain or improve Britain’s existing domestic pottery.

The alternative to a new domestic porcelain industry was to develop the already extant British earthenware trade.

Creamware imitated porcelain in appearance but took advan - tage of locally available materials and techniques.

Watt faced significant barriers in his pottery work.

Watt’s experiments on the bodies of his pottery wares were diverse.

In sourcing these materials, Watt’s often peripatetic life, travelling on business, paid dividends: he found good-quality killas clay near Falmouth in 1782, and his workshop contains a wooden box filled with mineral samples, as well as a small amount of ‘Asbestus’ in rock form, and even three human teeth and part of a jawbone, with a note that they were from the battle of ‘Louearly Field fought 1160’.

While travelling to Birmingham in 1774, Watt also conscientiously noted that the ‘stone grows softer and gravel harder’; he certainly developed a canny eye for potentially useful materials to employ at Delftfield.

Work on clays was accompanied by research on glazes.

Turning the clay and glaze ingredients into a finished product depended on them being fired in a kiln, and Watt turned his atten- tion to this, too.

Watt’s work on the Delftfield kilns, the better to bake hard the clay wares and finish the glazes, is a reminder that understanding the nature of heat, and how best to manipulate it, was a central concern to all those engaged in chemistry.

Watt’s developing understanding of the steam engine when he eventually returned to it.

This interpretation of the engine, rather than placing a division between Watt’s work on the engine and, say, his research at the Delft - field pottery, sees them as closely related.

If Watt’s working practices at Delftfield were informed by strong philosophical elements, as seems likely, then he was not alone.

The furnace was at the heart of much activity in philosophical laboratories.

Just as the laboratory chemist spent much time labouring over the furnace, so great ‘bottle’ kilns, named after their shape, loomed large in the working lives of potters.

All applications of heat shared the problem of how precisely to measure the temperatures attained.

The problem of measuring temperatures was solved in philo- sophical chemistry by, for instance, using thermometers of the type made by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit from 1724, or by Anders Celsius from 1742.

Wedgwood’s pyrometer embodies an interest in attaining the highest possible levels of precision across chemical experiments and processes.

Wedgwood specified precisely that clay obtained from Pensacola in North America ‘must be got as clean from soil, as if it was to be eat, & if they were to get several parcels, at different depths, & put them in separate Casks, properly number’d, I could by that means easily ascertain what depth of the mine is best for our purpose’.

And chemists could play a key role in validating the quality of such materials; as William Cullen wrote, ‘the philosophical chemist is the assay master to arts in general.

Although new means of precision measurement were becom- ing available, their use required more trust to be placed in those instruments than their users were sometimes willing to give.

George Smith describes how ‘Good water has no smell; such as abounds in aerial acid, diffuses a penetrating odour.

Acid occasions a gentle pungent acescent taste; a bitterness accompanies those waters which contain .

When Watt and Black corresponded about corrosion inside a pumping engine caused by the water, Black concluded that ‘the Water .

In this respect the experience in pottery matched that in philo- sophical chemistry.

This is not entirely to play down the role of new chemical equip- ment.

Just as there were extensive crossovers between the practices of philosophical and industrial chemistry, so the equipment used by Watt and Black in their experiments on heat bridged both worlds.

To summarize, then, chemistry in many areas of experimenta- tion and application was based on the accurate manipulation and measurement of heat.

Although their philosophies of the chemical nature of heat were similar, Black and Watt approached the nature of heat from subtly different starting points – Watt with the particular objective of mak- ing the engine work, and Black from the perspective of explaining philosophically how a substance absorbs heat.

The historian Arthur Donovan claimed that Black’s move from Glasgow to take up a post at the University of Edinburgh in 1766 as ‘the end of his career as a creative philosophical chemist’.

Black wrote to Watt in March 1772, ‘I have no chemical news, my attempts in Chemistry at present are chiefly directed to the exhibition of Processes and experiments for my Lectures, which require more time and trouble than one would imagine.

Black had begun his research on heat in 1755 when he was first appointed to the college at Glasgow.

Watt’s experiments with engines led him to similar conclusions.

As for the amount of steam required being considerably more than the volume of the cylinder, this brings us to the capacity a body has to absorb heat, or its specific heat.

The nature of specific heat had also been explored through smaller-scale experimental means.

Watt’s responses to the nature of specific and latent heat shaped the design of his steam engine.

With progress made in his understanding of the engine, the way forward for Watt lay in refining it as a truly practical industrial machine.

With the finances of the engine project uncertain, Watt also faced changes in his personal life.

The child had been delivered stillborn, and Peggy, his wife, had died afterwards.

£2,000 in total,2 or over £125,000 in today’s money – and by the impressiveness of its operation.

The engine built by Watt as business partner to Matthew Boulton of Birmingham was a landmark machine in the history of the Industrial Revolution and, in the aspirations for how it would be constructed, was unlike anything that had gone before.

First and foremost, the engine was a product of the metalwork- ing capabilities of the city of Birmingham.

This centrepiece of Birmingham’s manufactures played a prominent  ole in the history of the steam engine.

As a metalworking centre Birmingham was home to over 50 dis- tinct trades, and this unprecedented concentration of industry attracted visitors anxious to see the sights.

The town of Birmingham is vast, handsome and well-peopled, its roads broad and straight .

And Robert Southey was ‘dizzied with the hammering of presses, the clatter of engines, and the whirling of wheels .

These conditions, so vividly imprinted on the memory of those who witnessed them, were the product of an industrial culture that emphasized the transformation of ideas into practical schemes.

At the forefront of Birmingham’s industries stood Matthew Boulton.

By 1768 Boulton’s business was prominent enough for him to be described as the ‘most complete manufacturer in England, in metal’.

Boulton’s success was also based on an astonishing ability to network and exploit the connections of the world of polite commerce.

We had Prince Poniatowski, the nephew of the King of Poland, the French, the Danish, the Sardinian, and ye Dutch Ambassadors .

Boulton’s friend William Small jested with him about his networking prowess: ‘I hope the King and Royal Family, the nobility and the Ministry and your other friends are well.

With his manufacturing capabilities, and the networks of con- tacts at his disposal, Boulton was ‘an iron chieftain, and .

To stabilize his finances, Boulton needed a new, successful business opportunity.

With his boldness and connections, Boulton was the perfect partner for the more retiring Watt.

The manufacture of buttons was, like many of Birmingham’s other products, driven by the demands of fashion.

From reaching the height of their popularity in the 1780s, the vagaries of taste meant that, by 1791, 20,000 people working in the buckle trade were petitioning the Prince of Wales claiming distress.

To satiate the heavy demand for buttons, their manufacture very quickly developed into a carefully organized and efficient process, which became one of the highlights of Soho.

But out of these the most popular was steel – so popular, in fact, that often cheaper glass was polished up to imitate it.

Turning this steel into the finished product took a whole range of techniques, which were perfect candidates for the application of simple machine tools like presses, stamps and lathes.

With the button’s shape and decoration finished, it would need mounting on a ‘shank’, a shallow hook, so it could be fixed to clothing.

Choreographing all these techniques required careful organ- ization, and each worker came to be an expert in a single, tiny part of the overall process.

Some button makers estimated that this way of working was twenty times faster than when each individual item was made by a single worker.

The button making workforce consisted of men, women and children.

Button making contributed, then, to the industrious atmosphere of Soho that so exhilarated visitors.

We can almost hear the heave and thud of the drop stamps, the tinkle of the button blanks falling from the presses, the whirring treadles of lathes and the thunder of feet as children raced boxes of materials from one workshop to the next.

The basics of engine manufacturing were well established.

Importantly, then, beyond the very specialized parts like the ‘nozzles’, which controlled the flow of steam in and out of the cylinder, Boulton & Watt did relatively little of the physical work of engine-building themselves.

This was a canny move: the partners realized that manufacturing Watt’s improved engine and exploiting it commercially were not necessarily the same thing.

What, then, of assembling engines like buttons? This was a powerful piece of rhetoric, suggesting Boulton’s formidable persua - sive abilities and shining a light on the close interconnections between machine making and a wider world of manufacture and consump- tion.

This complexity dogged Boulton & Watt from the start because of the location of most of their likely customers.

While we have considered the actions of steam and heat inside the engine, we have not yet explored the engine as a physical artefact that had to safely and efficiently exploit those properties, the construc - tion of which was the major challenge that now confronted Boulton & Watt.

So, there was some impetus to use different or new materials.

The pattern maker had to understand the entire casting process: he had to avoid sharp internal corners, which could lead to cracks in the cooling metal, and surfaces were always tapered, not quite parallel or square; if they were, there was a worse chance that they would stick in the sand mould, damaging its surfaces.

The patterns would be placed in huge beds of sand, which was packed around them so that, when they were lifted out, a perfect negative copy was left behind for molten metal to be poured into.

Alongside casting, forging the iron to shape was an important part of steam engine construction.

These three main processes were central to the manufacture of many parts of the engine, and would have comprised much of the work carried out at Soho.

With foundry and forge work highly dependent on the hand skills of the foundryman, pattern maker or smith, the only part of the engine that required a dedicated, highly accurate machine tool was the cylinder.

Watt experimented with cork, pasteboard, leather and linseed oil.

But the best strategy was to make the cylinder as accurately as possible and, for this, Watt depended on the ingenuity of John Wilkinson who, in 1775, made a cylinder-boring machine.

Having made the unfinished components, and the cylinder, it was now time to fit them together.

The arrival of all the parts on site marked the first time the complete engine would have been united at a single location.

Boulton wrote home from Cornwall in 1779, ‘Tom Bowden has had two of his fingers burnt one quite broke off James Darlestone his hand much hurt, so that out of seven we have but four that can work.

The opportunities for injury reflected the nature of the engine- erecting process.

If a lot of metal had to be removed, huge ‘flogging’ chisels, over a foot long, were used, with one man gripping the chisel in both hands and another wielding a sledgehammer.

Drilling holes in metal was equally time-consuming and labour- intensive.

Watt would have been acquainted with the techniques of foundry, forge and fitting even before he began his partnership with Boulton.

Matthew Boulton was also heavily engaged in Cornwall.

Presently Boulton and Watt appointed William Murdoch as their chief representative in Cornwall, his technical skill and ability to take on fractious Cornish miners with his fists if so required – an option hardly open to the reticent Watt – giving him considerable authority, and freeing Boulton and Watt for other activities.

For Watt this meant working at his home in Birmingham with an assistant on calculations, correspondence and drawings, and only occasionally venturing onto the shop floor.

This comes with a caveat, however.

First came new paper systems.

Of particular importance was Watt’s method of letter copying.

Paper processes were matched by technical improvements to the engine itself.

Even a standard design of engine house was adopted.

Finally, making measurements associated with the engine led to the development of new precision instruments.

It is tempting to say that Boulton’s declaration that he was making engines like buttons was canny marketing.

Wilkinson was at Bersham, Harrison at Soho, Perrins at Bloomfield and Watt at his house – separated by miles, but all working on the same project.

By 1800 Boulton & Watt had built 440 engines, each of which, with its attendant boilers for raising steam, was the size of a modern detached house.

First, just as Watt was intrigued by heat, and measured it with thermometers, mechanics used heat to work metal, and measured it by the metal’s colour.

Further, as measuring heat depended on the visual acuity of the smith, the potter or chemist, and the latter two employed their senses of smell and taste in pursuing experiments with chemical substances, so the sense of touch was essential to accurate metalworking.

The dramatic scene is lit by the molten iron flowing from the blast furnace into moulds.

Third, just as Watt’s work on the engine was driven by his moral dislike of wasting steam, so the engine’s design and construction was driven by minimizing the effort used in making its component parts.

Lastly, the presence of so much woodwork is a reminder that, although the engine became the emblematic machine of the new industrial age, it was being built in advance of many of the other industrial machines which would have assisted in its production.

As for steam, we leave it at an important crossroads: in time engines would be made in the same way as buttons, but that was a little way in the future.

Within six years Boulton & Watt’s machine had almost entirely dis- placed the old atmospheric engine in Cornwall.

The city of Manchester divided opinion.

The differing experiences of these two visitors were occasioned by Manchester’s explosive growth.

Manchester was the city that set the benchmark for Britain’s new industrial towns, and the material that formed its primary prod- uct has also become an emblem of Britain’s Industrial Revolution: cotton.

Manchester was well placed to capitalize on the cotton trade.

Part of cotton’s attraction was its versatility.

The name indelibly linked with cotton manufacture is that of Richard Arkwright.

Arkwright’s success was based on a new type of cotton-spinning machine.

Arkwright’s conceptualization of the factory certainly caught the imaginations of many of his contemporaries.

Jabez Maud Fisher had earlier written of Cromford that the way ‘the [water]wheel sets in motion many thousands of others; and the Sight of all this variety of motion is the most pleasing imaginable’, and that it was ‘the Greatest Curiosity in the Mechanical Work in Great Britain’.

The early 1780s were busy for Boulton & Watt.

Watt’s interest in engines that would produce a turning motion – called rotary or rotative engines – was long-standing [illus.

Watt was initially reluctant.

Boulton & Watt now found themselves having to find a way round the patents held by Pickard on the crank and Wasborough Fragments of Watt’s rotary engine, 1782.


Watt to build a rotative beam engine, and they patented it in 1781.

The first of Boulton & Watt’s rotative engines set running outside Soho was built for John Wilkinson in 1783, and by 1800, they had built 278 as opposed to 171 pumping engines.

But not all was as the raw numbers suggest.

So, potential customers for their rotative engine wanted power, if they wanted it at all, on a small scale.

Often that alternative was a variant of Newcomen’s atmospheric engine.

Further, waterwheels remained a serious proposition for many prospective customers.

A waterwheel like that installed at Arkwright’s Cromford mill might generate 12 horsepower but, by 1800, wheels of 80 horsepower were in use.

These developments reduced the incentive to adopt steam power.

If they wished to purchase an engine, customers need not turn just to Boulton & Watt: there were many other competing firms.

As in scientific instrument making, there was room alongside the very best for those building machines that were just sufficient for the job in hand.

So, although Matthew Boulton predicted that rotative engines presented ‘a field that is boundless’, this declaration did not neces - sarily transpose into orders for engines.

One of visitors’ abiding memories of Manchester was its ‘dark black smoaky atmosphere’, the product of a growing number of chimneys, each connected to a boiler for raising steam.

Together they supplied the town with a constant fug of smoke, ‘an inky canopy which seemed to embrace and involve the entire place’.

Alongside the polluted atmosphere, Manchester at street level must have been an assault on visitors’ senses; in 1835 Alexis de Tocqueville described ‘the crunching wheels of machinery, the shriek of steam from boilers, the regular beat of the looms, the heavy rumble of carts’ s ‘the noises from which you can never escape in the sombre half- light of these streets’.

If the external effects of engines were the subject of negative comment, the machinery inside, by comparison, left a very favourable impression on those who saw it.

A question arises, then, over who the people were to best deliver this modern, mechanical world.

Millwrighting was originally a peripatetic job, and millwrights, ‘like other wandering tribes .

The millwright’s particular job was to construct the shafts and wheels known as ‘mill-work’, needed to couple a power source to the production machinery.

Practical work was matched by skill at negotiation and draughts- manship as well.

All was underpinned by the millwright’s ability to manipulate materials.

So, the means of building the internal systems of a mill were provided by the millwright, using many of the techniques used to construct engines that we have earlier discussed.

As the eighteenth century progressed, and possession of a time- keeper became as much a mark of social standing as it was a record of timekeeping per se, horology was a growing trade.

The machinery seen in this view, used to prepare the cotton for spinning,  s driven by the belts and shafts suspended from the ceiling above.

‘The Watch Maker’, from The Book of Trades (1824).

How clockmaking was organized varied across Britain.

In contrast to the London trade stood those making clocks who might have been trained as blacksmiths and in associated trades, build ing locks or even firearms.

The nature of the clocksmith’s workshop reflected their combin - ation of skills.

The presence of the forge is a reminder of the need to heat materials so that they could be shaped.

– that is, the more it is worked, with a hammer, file or in the lathe, the tougher it becomes.

The clocksmith had to carefully consider the relationship between these different materials.

Alongside tools like hammers and files, which might be found across a variety of trades, clocksmiths were early in adopting special-purpose tools.

The complex processes of clockmaking produced, and attracted, self-sufficient and innovative craftsmen.

These examples show that there were extensive connections between clockmaking and larger-scale engineering, and this was widely commented upon by contemporaries.

So, between them, clocksmiths and millwrights were capable of building complete production systems, integrating power sources, transmission systems and production machinery.

This was achieved in large part using long-established materials.

Cyclopedia (1819).

And in Birmingham he saw ‘enormous hammers, wielded by a steam engine .

Boulton & Watt capitalized on the imaginative attraction of machines by establishing a series of showcase engine installations.

To fully secure the company’s future prosperity, one last, major matter remained to be resolved.

Watt realized: without their permission, John Wilkinson, upon whom they depended for engine cylinders, built and sold no fewer than 34 ngines based on their designs, and this indicates the high financial stakes for all concerned in the form of unpaid engine royalties.

The legacy of Boulton & Watt as their partnership ended in 1800 as proved controversial.

1790–1800, as illustrated in Tomlinson’s The Useful Arts and Manufactures  f Great Britain (1861).

What was needed, as this chapter has explored, could be met by adapt - ing and scaling up existing, long-established craft skills.

Fischer’s first port of call was the engine yard at the Soho Manufactory, and he was ‘dumbfounded’ at what he saw: ‘No descrip- tion could do justice to the building in which these works are housed.

The works are completely enclosed by a high wall and consist of several separate buildings, each of which is many hundreds of feet in length.

In all these buildings steam engines were at work, performing their tasks ‘quietly, regularly and efficiently – a tribute to all that human ingenuity has contributed to their construction’.

What is most notable about Fischer’s account is who was responsible for what he saw in the works.

Two major technical issues affected the firm in the late 1790s.

The Soho Foundry was designed from the start along rational, pre-planned lines.

The Foundry was built around nine workshops, each dedicated to a particular process: for example, cylinder boring, turning, fitting, smithing and pattern making.

Taylor, [Henry] Ford, nor other experts devise anything .

The Soho Foundry was vital to the continued success of Boulton & Watt, and it came alongside a business strategy that was markedly different from that previously adopted, and which contributed to the company’s success into the nineteenth century.

As well as building beam engines, the company recognized the increasing demand for smaller, more compact and self-contained engine designs.

As well as new products the company also more actively sought new markets.

The Soho Foundry was a major landmark in the history of machine making: it was the first purpose-built factory dedicated to constructing machines.

Consequently, the Foundry received a series of extensions to provide additional workshop space in the first eight years of its existence.

By 1804 the total construction cost amounted to more than £27,000, over £850,000 at today’s prices, but the whole debt had been repaid out of profits by 1812.

The young James had been intended to have a similar grounding to his father: conventional training in carpentry along with book- keeping, mathematics and the rudiments of running a business, with a view to becoming an engineer or a manufacturer.

If Watt Junior had received a thorough and comprehensive education, however, his efforts very often were seen in a dim light by his father.


Maxwell, a company of cotton dyers and printers, and came under the influence of Thomas Walker, an ardent republican whose views must have appealed to his latent sense of rebellion, and Watt James Watt Junior portrayed by an unknown artist, c.

Junior found himself taking a leading role in the city’s Literary and Philosophical Society celebrating the Revolution in France.

If James Watt Junior’s revolutionary education came to a prema - ture end, he still benefited from a further education of an affective nature.

This, it is argued, amounted to an ‘affective revolution’ in which people for the first time expected their emotions to have some kind of tangible expression.

This wasn’t just a one-man project: Watt Senior designed and built the gas-making apparatus.

This is not to suggest that early engineers and machine makers were all nitrous oxide fiends and libertines, although Joshua Field recalled the 1820s ironmaster John Tickle as ‘an extraordinary character – a kind of excentric genious a Chymist & a Poet’, which sounds close.

Classical influences pervaded the education that a young man like Watt Junior might receive in the late eighteenth century.

The influence of the antique is suggested by the schoolbooks, notebooks and reading undertaken by James Junior’s half-brother, Gregory, totalling approximately 120 items, which are contained in a hair chest stored inside Watt’s workshop.

So, in advance of the emergence of a formal curriculum for training young engineers, their education might be both wide- ranging and disparate.

Boulton & Watt’s work on the engine happened in parallel with tremendous popular appetite for the antique – the culture, archi - tec ture and artefacts of ancient Greece and Rome.

They also got into the hands of Watt’s associates.

Recueil d’antiquités égyptiennes, étrusques, grecques, romaines et gaul oises, published in 1752–7.

There is a question over how far into the ranks of Britain’s machine makers antique influences pervaded.

With particular reference to those making machines, there survives a sketchbook that belonged to William Creighton, who rose from erecting engines for Boulton & Watt to become head of their drawing office in 1815, and was a highly active contributor to James Watt Junior’s affective education.

It may be that producing work inspired by antiquity was a more accessible occupation than it might initially appear.

Mr Boulton was making an immense large Tripod .

Wedgwood obtained the work for himself by cunningly suggesting they should ‘call in some able Potter to their assistance .

Although the most attention was devoted to these very expen- sive objects, made in relatively small quantities, antiquity also found its way into the output of Boulton’s toymakers.

So, antiquity pervaded the environment in which machine- makers and manufacturers like Boulton & Watt operated.

William Chambers’s Treatise on the Decorative Part of Civil Architecture provides a springboard for exploring how they did so.

Regarding how the engine worked, Boulton & Watt had taken great care with their standardized range of machines to define the physical characteristics of each – so much so that John Farey devoted an entire chapter of his magisterial Treatise on the Steam Engine (1827) to discussing them.

The same year that Farey’s book was published, Thomas Tredgold produced his own book, The Steam Engine.

However, the sudden expansion of publishing about steam raises an important question: Boulton & Watt’s partnership had ended in 1800 and since then, two decades had elapsed with no clearly formulated guides on how to make those engines beyond those materials already written by the firm of Boulton & Watt.


As a first step, we return to the influence of antiquity.

It is tempting to suggest that here was a system ready-made to be appropriated when designing engines.

Watt were designing a 52-horsepower engine for the cotton spinner James Kennedy of Manchester in 1806 for which the valve gear controlling the flow of steam to the cylinder was in the shape of a pair of fluted columns, topped by a finely detailed entablature.

Tellingly the pair were in exactly the proportions required by the Tuscan order.

We must not forget that as understanding of its internal work- ings grew, the engine was increasingly perceived not as a static structure, but as one subject to dynamic stresses and strains, which would change continuously as it worked.

This is not to entirely discount the influence of antiquity on engineering design.

We have rummaged all the ancients and moderns from Palladio to that great aristocrat and Knight Sir William Chambers in quest of tables and propriety and having altered and altered and altered again and again various ingenious and highly meritorious designs have at last concentrated the essence of our ‘labours’ in one which for taste, beauty, magnificence, and utility will vie with the most renowned products of any genius of any age or nation before the conquest of Egypt.

Later James Nasmyth wrote that ‘viewing abstractedly the forms of the various details of which every machine is composed, we shall find that they consist of certain combinations of six geometrical figures, namely, the line, the plane, the circle, the cylinder, the cone, and the sphere.

First and foremost, Boulton and Watt continued to wield consid er  able moral influence, even though they were personally no longer involved in building engines.

An almost innumerable quantity of schemes for improvements on the steam engine have been crowded on the public eye within the last ten years, but except a few for improvements in construction, of small importance, there has been nothing done that is worthy of detaining the reader to notice.

As late as 1868, John Bourne was still publishing Watt’s rules of thumb for engine making – for determining the thickness of the connecting rod, the diameters of shafts and the size of beams, for instance – alongside more recent theories.

How far engineers actually stuck to Boulton and Watt’s plans is questionable.

The occasional effects of these disparate approaches were seen by William Creighton in Glasgow, where he wrote in April 1803 f having ‘visited several of the engines here .

Not all engineers were single-minded, deadly rational beings like Watt.

As we left the engine, being built on a new standardized scheme at the Soho Foundry, it was very much a functional machine, accu- rately built but with little conscious thought given to its outward appearance.

Rather than the traditional division between process and product, what we have here is the process as product.

From the 1790s cast iron was being employed in greater quan- tities, and the means of shaping it offered new aesthetic possibilities.

All this work depended on improved pattern making and foundry work.

The foundryman had to avoid air bubbles in castings and sought to ensure toughness by carefully cooling the finished product over a long period.

The potential of cast iron for multiplying decorative details in machinery was not lost on contemporary engineers, who wrestled Boulton & Watt’s ‘Lap’ beam engine, 1788.

First among these was the application of antiquity.

The aesthetic transformation of the engine was noted by contem - poraries.

This quotation leads us beyond the purely antique forms towards other influences that came to bear for relatively short but intense periods.

Gothic forms were supplemented by an Egyptian revival in mechanical form.

If these startling reinventions of long-established designs suggest discontinuity, they are balanced by strong elements of stabi - lity and continuum.

London, 1817.

This approach is best conveyed, not by Boulton & Watt in Birmingham, or even Murray in Leeds, but by the engineers of London and, particularly, Henry Maudslay.

This approach was carried through to the machine tools Maudslay built for his London works, and in turn influenced those who trained there.

Here, then, was the start of a new machine aesthetic which had its own character.

After 1800, two competing pressures shaped how this new approach evolved.

This is not to characterize the new way of designing machines as a complete break with the past: in its details, it was not.

Although we have described distinct ‘design styles’ – classical, Gothic, a new ‘machine aesthetic’ – surviving artefacts also point to the parallel existence of an active vernacular school of engineer- ing design.

Some nineteenth-century commentators would take a dim view of this approach.

In treating the output of the early nineteenth-century engineers as art, then, we can see that its substance, and its virtues or defects, were both varied and contested.

Regardless of how it was attained, however, the period until the 1840s was unrivalled in its pursuit of beauty in engineering.

When Hans Casper Escher visited Manchester in 1814, he wrote that ‘One must admire the steam engines here.

The engine in all its forms exerted a continued imaginative effect on those who saw it at work.

The emergence of the engine as a carefully styled object reflects its role as symbol of the new industrial age, signalling dignity, pros- perity and status as much as technical mastery.

This approach was entirely congruent with how the antique was appropriated and imitated in other industries, comprising ‘an evocation of objects in other forms, and indeed the new form might well surpass the original in inventiveness’.

The staircase up to the second floor of James Watt’s house, Heathfield, was steep and dark.

The workshop was in the attic of Heathfield, commissioned by Watt from the architect James Wyatt in 1789 for a site on Handsworth Heath, a mile and a half northwest from the centre of Birmingham.

The room that Watt chose to be his workshop was at first simply a place to stow away belongings; in 1801 he sent for a quantity of possessions from Glasgow, and these duly arrived.

The garret workshop had a dual purpose.

Watt’s sculpture project was not confined to his workshop but sprawled over several different parts of Heathfield.

The children of the Pemberton family, tenants living at Heathfield in the 1860s, recalled ‘wonderful discoveries of out-of-the-way things .

The two sculpture-copying machines embody Watt’s continuing fascination with precision manufacture.

Development of the machines presented Watt with several challenges.

The machines built on a broader interest in sculpture, and con- nections to the sculpture trade, that reached back into the 1790s.

Museum, London.

Pierotti came from Lucca in northwest Italy and had arrived in England at Dover in 1770 before living in Birmingham and then Edinburgh, where he was entered on the Register of Aliens on 2 December 1803.

Nothing is known about him beyond this, but we do know that con- siderable numbers of mould makers or formatori came from Lucca, itinerant makers and vendors of plaster casts.

Vases at 3s.

Watt evidently purchased some items from Pierotti while the latter was based in Birmingham because, alongside his catalogue, there survives in Watt’s workshop a bill ‘for making moulds of Plaster of Paris’, marked ‘Birmingham October the 8th 1792’.

As well as finished casts, Watt was also an avid collector of moulds for antique figures.

Watt’s copying machines were, then, the culmination of a sus- tained interest in the world of sculpture that extended to purchasing moulds and taking his own copies from them.

Further demand for sculpture was driven by the Grand Tour, as the well-to-do and classically educated set out from Britain to see the antique sights of Italy, visiting Rome, Pompeii, Herculaneum and Venice, among other places.

Returning from that experience, they sought small, portable pieces of sculpture that could be displayed in their homes as symbols of wealth, knowledge and connoisseurship.

By the mid-eighteenth century, then, a professional trade had emerged in England, to satisfy the demand for sculpture.

But another, unique trade in cheaper statuary and statuettes, most often made in plaster, evolved in early nineteenth-century England.

How the plaster copy trade generated reproductions was a tortuous process.

This background helps contextualize Watt’s copying machines: he had an interest in sculpture of some long standing, there was a widely held appetite for sculpture in materials ranging from marble to plaster, and low-quality copies offered the potential for improve- ment.

What is notable about all these machines is the length of time after Watt’s that they were made.

With his experience of turning either a three-dimensional shape or a two-dimensional letter into a two-dimensional image (as with his physiognotrace and polygraph respectively), it was a logical next step for Hawkins to experiment with turning a three-dimensional original into a three-dimensional copy – as in sculpture copying – nd that is exactly what he did.

That neighbour was Hawkins.

Whatever happened, Watt’s sculpture-copying machines were the first of a new generation of machines constructed to the same end.

However, precision did not necessarily trump cheapness in the world of sculpture copying for the masses; it is telling that both John Hawkins and, to a slightly lesser extent, Benjamin Cheverton died in reduced circumstances.

Assuming a mechanical carver could produce two busts in a long, 80-hour week, perhaps three with practice, this was still far behind the output for producing plaster casts.

And Achille Collas, manufacturing sculpture by machine in France, found that pirates immediately cast copies of his copies and sold them much cheaper than he could.

Watt’s sculpture-copying machines are enigmatic, then.

What became more significant than the commercial aspects of sculpture for Watt were the practicalities of multiplying his own image.

As well as the Chantrey and Turnerelli busts, Watt’s workshop contains a mystery object that has only recently been identified.

Boulton, James Watt’s business partner and friend, made 1809–19.

Watt was, then, generating images of himself in considerable quantities.

Watt’s copying machines represent a growing trend towards the mechanization of all sorts of manufactures.

Boulton’s minting machines are suggestive of a broader trend towards mechanization; in cotton factories, an automatic spinning machine of 1825 could process 100 lb of cotton sixteen times faster than the equivalent machine in 1780, in only 125 hours as opposed to 2,000.

Watt’s steam engine was the icon of Carlyle’s age of machinery, instrumental in ‘effecting the most remarkable revolution in all departments of industry that the world has ever seen’.

Britain was using half as much steam power again as the whole of western Europe.

The Romantic poet William Wordsworth believed Watt was, ‘considering both the magnitude and the universality of his genius .

Images of Watt, in the shape of portraits and busts, statues and memorials, played a major role in his posthumous promotion; a whole genre of ‘Watt art’ sprang up.

The generation of so much iconography around Watt fed debates about the nature of his achievements throughout the nineteenth century.

This careful shaping of Watt’s legacy reflects a second aspect of the debate about him: whether he was a philosopher or a craftsman.

The controversy over Watt’s legacy, and what he stood for, has raged up to the present day as engineering and science have been afforded differing degrees of priority.

By the centenary of Watt’s death in 1919, however, he had been firmly reappropriated as a craftsman and engineer: it is telling that one of the largest groups of contributors to the commemorative appeal launched in 1919 ‘comprised workers in engineering and metal- working firms throughout the Birmingham region’.

Watt Junior kept the workshop door firmly locked and the room remained entirely untouched until his own death in 1848.

The classical ‘garret’ and all its mysterious contents .

For Muirhead the workshop was a place of religious significance, as it was for the biographer Samuel Smiles, who finished a detailed account of its contents by stating that in it the ‘spirit’ of Watt’s work survived, as if embodied in the artefacts ‘fast crumbling to decay’.

Woodcroft (1803–1879) was chief among the nineteenth-century pursuers of Watt ‘relics’.

Woodcroft was highly active, his patent work was strategically impor- tant to Britain as nineteenth-century industry expanded and, with the Patent Museum, he had the chance to indulge his antiquarian instincts.

Early among these was a ‘tea kettle’ said to be in the possession of Watt’s descendants.

Alongside these items, however, Watt’s workshop remained the ultimate prize.

By January 1864 no progress had been made, and Woodcroft, exas- perated, wrote to Pettit Smith, ‘I am ready to go with you any day to Birmingham whether Mr Gibson Watt gives his permission or not.

The visitors were so engrossed in what they saw that they spent seven hours exploring, and Woodcroft left his glasses behind; they Watt’s alleged ‘experimentalising steam kettle’, forming part of a  elf-contained ‘bachelor’s stove’ with grate and cooking pan, c.

Woodcroft’s fascination with the workshop reflected a very particular, mechanical view of the world and of Watt.

A short distance away, the Soho Manufactory was either empty or being sublet, and was demolished in early 1863.

Individual machines also faced an uncertain future.

Even if an artefact did perchance find its way to a museum, its survival was still not guaranteed, because popular fascination with historic machines was manifested in a very tactile, hands-on way.

As with so many other artefacts, the future of Watt’s workshop was never entirely certain.

The heroic objects pictured include Richard Arkwright’s spinning machine  t bottom left, the locomotive Rocket alongside it, and the ‘Comet’ marine  ngine at top right.

The workshop remained at Heathfield for the rest of the nine- teenth century.

– it remains a possibility that they found their way inside the work- shop, too.

Far from being undisturbed, the workshop contents were subject to some considerable disruption.

Aside from unexpected removals, the workshop contents were in a parlous physical condition by the 1880s.

The multifaceted nature of the workshop had already been noted by Samuel Smiles when he visited it in 1864 or 1865, and his evo- cation of what he saw is valuable enough to be quoted in detail: Many objects lay about or in the drawers .

Smiles wrongly identified a number of items in the workshop while describing them, including a model of the governor used by Watt to regulate the speed of the steam engine.

Only in 1924 did a plan for preserving this diverse range of items finally coalesce.

To conclude, then, we return to the question of whether Watt was a philosopher or a craftsman.
