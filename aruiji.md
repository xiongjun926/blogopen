Exploring Britain’s Postwar Imperial
Relations
Between the 1940s and 1960s key transformations occurred in Britain’s for­
eign relations and in international relations in general. Britain went through
difficult years of postwar reconstruction while experiencing foreign exchange
and reserve crises. The period was marked by fierce rivalry with the United
States in the international economy, heated debates over Europe, and the
apparently sudden and unexpected end of the British empire. The role of the
sterling area for Britain increased considerably after the war, but the area
then withered away in the 1960s. At the same time, Britain achieved eco­
nomic recovery and created the welfare state in a changing global context.
The international political and economic order was recast. After 1945, the
United States – a former colony – assumed the role of guardian of the
Western world, and the dollar took on the function of the world’s leading
currency of international exchange which the pound sterling had occupied
before the war. The West moved from the defensive protectionism of the
1930s towards liberal multilateralism in international economic relations
and the full implementation of the Bretton Woods system in the 1960s.
Britain and the pound were ultimately reintegrated in a liberal world econ­
omy. The periphery became embedded in a novel way in the international
economy and, with the formation of many independent states, in a
reformed state system too. Moreover, for the British colonies, the period
brought consequential transformations in social structure and political orga­
nization. Tropical Africa experienced perhaps the only period under colonial
rule during which it was clearly an economic asset for the imperial centre.
Peripheral development was launched, taking on markedly different mean­
ings for colonizers, academics and political activists.
This book tells the story of the striking transformation in Britain’s imper­
ial relations from the onset of peace-time economic discrimination in the
empire with the convertibility crisis of 1947 to the return to cosmopoli­
tanism with the official convertibility of sterling in 1958. The argument is
embedded within the wider context of international relations, linking
Britain’s external economic and sterling relations with imperial relationships
34 Money and the End of Empire
and policies. Accordingly, the account is placed in the longer time-frame
from the Second World War to the 1960s. The study discusses the impact of
changes in the international economic environment, the British state and
colonial states, and the socio-economic transformations in Britain and areas
on the periphery. In doing so, it offers a continuation of research on earlier
periods that deal with British imperial economic relations in the face of
challenges from the United States in particular. The analysis, moreover,
attempts to bring a novel perspective to the interpretation of the end of the
British empire. 1 In broad terms, the arguments advanced here are relevant to
the relationship between the state and finance in international relations,
British welfare capitalism and economic performance, and state formation
and economic development on the periphery, and they may advance discus­
sion of comparative perspectives of foreign policy. 2 However, the book will
have achieved its objective if it illuminates a formative episode in Britain’s
imperial and international economic relations, and raises awareness of the
significance, specifically, of the connection between finance, empire and
decolonization.
1. The historiography
The past 15 years or so have witnessed the resurgence of studies of eco­
nomic and financial relationships in Britain’s empire and between the
British empire and the wider world. 3 The financial theme was a mainstay
of the historiography of postwar Britain, including the 1940s and 1950s, 4
and contemporary studies have of course included the empire. 5 None the
less, this research subsequently has made little impact on general studies
of Britain’s imperial relations or on the end of the British empire. The
neglect is surprising as sterling relationships are known to have been cru­
cial to Britain’s economic predicament in the two decades following the
Second World War. Although there is now a large literature on the subject
of decolonization, only a few studies so far have investigated imperial rela­
tions during the period from the perspective of interstate relations, and
fewer still have dealt with imperial financial relations. A handful of them
have focused on the late 1940s and treated specific regions, such as India, 6
or shed light on the implications of Britain’s link with the empire for
Anglo-European relations. 7 Regional studies are preoccupied with the
effects of policy on the periphery and are rarely interested in exploring
external relationships from a British perspective. 8 A limited number of
interpretative surveys attach importance to imperial financial relations;
helpful though they are, they are necessarily abbreviated. 9
Of the studies closely related to the topic of this book that have made a
serious attempt to deal with the massive documentation now available,
four merit consideration. The most noteworthy recent study of the sterling
area sets out important quantitative data and places the argument withinExploring Britain’s Postwar Imperial Relations 5
the context of the debates about British economic performance. Therefore,
this research gives less attention to imperial or regional aspects of sterling
area relationships, and the author emphasizes that her study does not
focus on the political dimension. 10 Studies of the periphery taking the
perspective of development have illuminated important issues of imperial
sterling relationships, and investigated the links between development
doctrines and colonial economic policy during and immediately after the
Second World War. 11 Apart from that, an official history of colonial devel­
opment has summarized important archival material relating to the imper­
ial sterling area. 12 Finally, there are articles that have brought the subject
forward by integrating an investigation of developments on the periphery
with those in the centre in a specific period. 13
The research traditionally associated with the end of empire (usually
labelled decolonization) provides a wealth of factual information on the
political aspects of British imperial and colonial policies. None the less,
these studies rarely draw systematically on Britain’s international economic
relations. Yet without this element it is impossible to understand the
changes in imperial relations during the final phase of empire.
The bulk of decolonization studies written in the 1970s and early 1980s
focused on the ‘official mind’ of the Colonial Office in an attempt to pin
down the plans that, so it is claimed, phased in imperial retreat in Africa. 14
This approach had the great merit of presenting a clear-cut argument based
on newly released official documents, but its basic line of argument no
longer seems to be convincing. This research overstates the influence of the
Colonial Office in the British policy process: Britain simply did not have a
policy that executed a government-approved plan for imperial retreat from
the 1940s. 15 Moreover, the approach confuses constitutional and adminis­
trative change with the retreat from the empire and more generally colo­
nial with imperial policy. British policy, in the late 1940s, gradually
widened administrative and political participation in Africa. But this is evi­
dence of local administrative needs rather than of a big shift in the moral
purpose of imperial design from ‘good’ government to self-government
and ultimately independence. 16 In the few instances in which the ‘planned’
decolonization school incorporates economic factors, it does so specifically
with respect to colonial development policy rather than to Britain’s exter­
nal economic policy. Regional varieties of the ‘planned’ decolonization
school can be problematic too, because an accumulation of case-studies
does not necessarily add up to one coherent interpretation. 17
Studies emphasizing the ‘high politics’ of decolonization are mostly gen­
eral narratives, which tend to view economic, political and strategic factors
in isolation from one another. 18 However, important archival sources have
been used to explore the ‘high politics’ of empire and Anglo-American
wartime diplomacy, specific regions and, more recently, for a general essay. 19
None the less, few studies treat decolonization as a problem requiring a6 Money and the End of Empire
systematic investigation of international relations. Rather, decolonization
has become the epithet of a period, 20 and one author has labelled the prob­
lem a puzzle. 21 Decolonization may well be ultimately inexplicable. How­
ever, it is the historian’s trade to illuminate historical developments that
are not self-evident.
Another strand of decolonization research – and by implication numer­
ous studies of the periphery – attributes a crucial role to anti-colonial
nationalism in bringing about the end of colonial rule. Political opposition
in the colonies might have severely impeded the imperial purpose, or so
unsettled policy-makers that they thought it no longer worthwhile holding
on. 22 This is a valid argument, although it needs to be joined to an investi­
gation of the nature of imperial relationships and the centre’s policy priori­
ties to be able to explain how, where and why change on the periphery
affected the imperial centre.
Alternatives to the traditional approaches that interpret the end of the
British empire have so far been lacking, unlike in the case of France. 23 Fresh
research written under the label of decolonization falls outside the purview
of the present investigation because it conceives of decolonization in terms
of social change and changes in labour relations. 24 A rare, maverick essay
links population growth to nationalism and the end of colonialism. But this
article does not match its quantitative rigour with conceptual refinement
on economic relationships and the politics of economic relations. 25
Although the state of research on imperial policy relating to financial
relationships is fairly limited, there is a vast body of literature – much of it
of high quality – dealing with Britain’s external economic and financial
relations during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Recent historical studies, and
the excellent contemporary work by economists, of the sterling–dollar rela­
tionship, sterling policy and postwar Anglo-American relations chart the
changes in Britain’s position in the world economy from postwar recovery
to the implementation of the Bretton Woods Agreement. 26 Related research
links up with debates on British economic performance, either by high­
lighting the problems of economic policy in Britain’s recovery, or by argu­
ing about the divide between the financial and industrial sectors in the
British polity and economy. 27 In addition, political scientists and econo­
mists have produced a host of valuable literature on global financial
relationships. 28 Hardly any of this research deals with empire; but some
studies have shown an awareness of the necessity of exploring the imperial
dimension. 29 Other research has been helpful, without saying anything
about financial relationships, because it assesses the role of imperial pres­
sure groups and the ideological underpinnings of imperial policy. 30 Finally,
one ought not to forget the massive research now available on economic
institutions and social and political changes in individual British
colonies, 31 as well as recent research on imperial business relations during
the period. 32Exploring Britain’s Postwar Imperial Relations 7
In summary, a range of literature illuminates aspects of British foreign
and imperial relationships. None the less, studies of decolonization have
largely bypassed important aspects of imperial economic relations or have
not investigated them systematically, while most studies of Britain’s exter­
nal economic relationships and related matters have either omitted the
empire or treated specific topics only.
2. The investigation and argument
As will become obvious from this account, changes in interstate relations
are not simply the result of the decisions made by policy-makers or politi­
cians; nor are they the inevitable outcome of the necessities of economic
growth and global integration. Rather, foreign relations are shaped by the
structural environment in which policy is formulated and implemented. To
illuminate the transformation in Britain’s relations with the empire, there­
fore, one needs to study the interaction of diverse structural factors at the
centre of the empire and on the periphery, and, moreover, of external
influences on both. The argument advanced here will grapple with the
perennial problems of the interaction of political decisions and economic
relations, and the relevance of intentionality and structural conditions for
the policy process.
Imperial relationships hinged on the nature of the imperial state and
polity. Britain’s imperial relations were part of her wider financial and trad­
ing relationships based on the pound sterling. The British empire encom­
passed different social, economic and even political formations. However,
imperial territories related to Britain in a specific way. The British empire,
though by no means centrally organized in political terms, showed remark­
able coherence in terms of economic institutions, and was the core of the
sterling area, which embraced a number of independent states too. These
relationships were quite distinct from Britain’s other foreign relations and
those with the overseas periphery in the postcolonial period. Britain jeal­
ously retained its prerogative in trading and currency arrangements, espe­
cially in times of crises. Therefore, the present argument shows how a
specific state and polity framework left its imprints on imperial relations.
This argument adds a political dimension of international relations to the
debates on British economic performance and the welfare state.
The periphery’s role in imperial relations was twofold. On the one hand,
social and economic conditions in the colonies affected the centre; on the
other, the colonial state depended, by definition, on the imperial centre.
Important aspects of colonial policy and the management of the imperial
sterling area can be explained in terms of Britain’s wider interests in exter­
nal economic relations. For example, currency boards and marketing
boards were features of British colonial rule in many parts of the empire in
the twentieth century. The colonial state served as a means of control for8 Money and the End of Empire
the centre and constituted the periphery’s main political arena, which
potentially constrained the centre’s authority. There, the grand designs of
imperial purpose encountered local politics, where debates about trade dis­
crimination and liberalization, the sterling area and central banking took
on specific shades of meaning. At the same time, the social and economic
environment in the colonies was critical for the functioning of the sterling
area in line with British policy designs. However, the socio-economic for­
mations that emerged in the colonies in the 1940s and 1950s also
gradually undermined the imperial periphery’s role for Britain. This
environment was largely given but was, where possible, adjusted by parti­
san policy, which occasionally prompted conflicts with local political
activists.
The present analysis thus joins two layers of analysis – that of the centre
and of the periphery – thereby presenting many regional developments in
a fresh light. The argument advanced here links up with more general
debates on the state and its institutions in economic development, notably
colonial financial and marketing policies and central banking. The debates
about the currency board arrangements appear in the context of the poli­
tics of managing a currency area during a period of commodity surpluses
rather than the better known and more recent IMF-led device of structural
adjustment after debt and exchange crises. Furthermore, the centre’s for­
eign relations and policy priorities allow an assessment to be made of
Britain’s seemingly contradictory attitude towards colonial nationalism
and its socio-economic underpinnings. This argument may prompt future
studies to address the question of how the peculiar strand of welfare capi­
talism emerging in Britain after 1945 affected the process of state forma­
tion, political formations and economic development in the colonies.
Finally, to account for the overall transformation in imperial relations,
empires need to be studied in the international context. The imperial centre
and the periphery occupied specific places in the international economy in
terms of the nature, direction and quantity of their respective trade and cap­
ital flows, and in terms of policy orthodoxies, international legal arrange­
ments and even academic opinion. During the period under review, Britain
faced considerable difficulties in managing the pound sterling. Her tradi­
tional role as a capital market was in crisis and she herself became a debtor.
At the same time, Britain had little real influence on the shaping of the inter­
national economic order after the war. However, the colonies used sterling
for trade and reserves, and provided important export commodities that
were a significant asset for the balance of payments of the sterling area. Even
so, Britain needed the consent of the United States for protectionist policies
that ran counter to US-led international reorganization towards economic
multilateralism. The British colonies were locked into the Anglo-American
rivalry over influence in the international economy. The colonies served as
a counterpoise to the United States in their supporting role for the sterlingExploring Britain’s Postwar Imperial Relations 9
area. In this context, protectionist economic planning in the colonies
meshed with Fabian thinking about development. At the same time, the dol­
lar as a currency and the dollar area as an import market constituted poten­
tial alternatives to the dominant relationship with Britain that began to be
seen on the periphery as a straitjacket as new ideas about development
emerged. The present argument will show the interaction between economic
liberalization and imperial relations during the period, thereby illuminating
one episode in the history of globalization. An analysis of the empire in the
broad international context (together with an assessment of British policy
priorities) should also guard against a simplistic pecuniary argument about
imperial ‘decline’ and the ‘cost’ of the empire.
A sequence of important economic and political changes emerge from an
investigation of the different sets of influences upon imperial relations out­
lined above. Between 1947 and 1958, relationships first converged during a
phase of discriminatory economic management, then diverged during a
liberalizing phase, and finally drifted apart after the return to liberal cos­
mopolitanism at the end of the 1950s. In addition, antagonisms developed
between the liberalization in Britain’s external economic relations in the
1950s, established colonial economic policies and institutions, and eco­
nomic demands by nationalist activists in the imperial sterling area. What
is more, an examination of British policy suggests that the financial rela­
tionship discussed in the study evolved in such a way as to increase the
likelihood that imperial control would be abandoned. Until the mid-1950s,
political reform had been a means of binding the empire closer to Britain.
The retreat from the empire occurred at a time when the empire’s eco­
nomic potential for Britain was considerably diminished and when colo­
nial economic management was under strain in the areas of trade, financial
and development policies. Thus, the end of the British empire cannot be
explained in terms of the redefinition of the centre’s priorities in economic
and foreign policy alone. Nor was it in any simple way the result of a
mature revolutionary process on the periphery or a continuation of old
policies by neo-colonial means.
The economic role of the empire increased considerably during the ster­
ling crises between 1947 and 1953. Huge colonial sterling balances accumu­
lated, which supported Britain’s balances of payments. The empire was
crucial in re-establishing an equilibrium between the dollar and sterling
areas during the time of the dollar shortage. British institutions saw the
empire as a temporary support in restoring sterling as the leading interna­
tional currency in a multilateral environment. In this endeavour, Britain
relied on commodity exports from the empire in running the sterling area.
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the dependent sterling area constituted an
alternative to the ‘old’ independent Commonwealth and also to India.
Economic adjustment via the empire was a substitute for credits from
the United States, greater economic austerity in the independent sterling10
Money and the End of Empire
Commonwealth, and more stringent domestic adjustment for the manage­
ment of Britain’s recovery and the establishment of the welfare state. British
policy focused on commodities where discriminatory management was
politically feasible. The emphasis was put on systematic import restraint,
dollar discrimination and import substitution, while boosting specific export
commodities from the colonies and keeping capital flows to the colonies in
check. Until the mid-1950s, the colonial currency boards, and the marketing
boards in West Africa, were conducive to the empire’s role in sustaining the
sterling area.
None the less, as the 1950s wore on, colonial economies became less rel­
evant as Britain’s external economic policy moved in a more determined
way towards sterling convertibility and cosmopolitan sterling relationships.
The dollar gap was closing and the importance of commodity trade in the
international economy decreased. The liberalizing state became wary of the
practices of discriminatory management in general and of the huge colo­
nial sterling balances in particular. The reduction of sterling balances was
advisable in order to increase the appeal of sterling as an international cur­
rency, and because the British economy could absorb only a certain volume
of withdrawals at any one time. Britain needed to retain influence in the
currency and financial domains to check claims on its resources. British
colonial policy on currency matters and central banks is evidence of these
priorities.
Economic liberalization in the empire was, moreover, problematic because
it implied modifications in colonial institutions. Changes in the currency
boards and the marketing boards undermined the empire’s role in the ster­
ling area and contradicted established financial management. Furthermore,
it became clear in the late 1950s that the colonial periphery had little poten­
tial for a liberalized sterling area and Britain searched for other sources of
support, such as the Middle East. The colonies’ demands for capital exports
soared, commodity prices increased and trade surpluses decreased, while
their economic policies became redefined. Pressures on Britain also mounted
from demands on the periphery for an easing of restrictions on dollar
imports and for the diversification of reserves.
Socio-economic changes on the periphery, accompanied by a more devel­
oped political organization and an enlargement of the economic role of the
state, diminished the complementarity between the constituents of the ster­
ling area. In the late 1950s, developmental concerns and political pressures
in the colonies prompted demands for managing national economies as
part of the global economy rather than as appendages of Britain in the con­
text of the sterling area. Ultimately, the emerging commercial elites on the
imperial periphery fitted uncomfortably with British policy priorities in the
sterling area and the British conception of colonial economic development.
However, the influence these groups could exert on the colonial state and
vis-à-vis nationalist movements was in some cases limited.Exploring Britain’s Postwar Imperial Relations 11
By the 1960s, the international economic environment had changed and
Britain had moved into the post-imperial phase by re-emphasizing its cos­
mopolitan ties, as the importance of the Eurodollar market shows. None
the less, the profound transformation in Britain’s economic connection
with the empire either occurred or was anticipated in the 1950s, even if ex-
colonies did not leave the sterling area before the mid- and late 1960s.
3. Assumptions, limitations, presentation
Some final clarifications of the book’s claims, limitations and the presenta­
tion of the argument are needed here. The study examines the transforma­
tion of Britain’s ties with the empire as part of a system of coordinated
relations. The investigation is deliberately pitched at a general level of
analysis engaging with structural and policy issues in the imperial centre
and on the periphery. Economic, notably financial, relationships figure
prominently in the narrative because they were critical for Britain’s exter­
nal relations during the 1940s and 1950s. British imperial policy cannot be
isolated from this context.
It needs to be emphasized that the book advances an argument about a
clearly defined problem in international relations rather than painting a
picture of an historical period. The study establishes a hierarchical con­
struct of historical cognition that is falsifiable in its elements. However,
with regard to the explanation of the policy decision that led to Britain’s
retreat from empire, the precise causal link between context and decision is
ultimately beyond solution. 33
The study draws on a wide range of archival sources. The major debates rel­
evant to the position of the empire within British external economic and
notably financial relations are covered by archival documents from the Public
Record Office and the Bank of England. Given the British policy process, the
debates of interdepartmental committees were of critical importance. 34 The
colonies formed an integral part of these debates, even where colonial issues
were not their principal topic. Apart from relevant Cabinet decisions, internal
debates in major government departments have been analysed systematically,
namely the massive material contained in records of the Treasury (especially
the Overseas Finance Division), the Colonial Office (especially the Finance
and General Economic departments), the Bank of England and, to a lesser
extent, the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office. 35 The Treasury and Bank of
England shaped relations with the empire in the economic realm. But they
left political judgements about measures to secure vital political stability in
the colonies largely to the Colonial Office. The latter, in turn, had limited
influence upon imperial economic policy. In this respect, the Colonial Office
Finance Division was a mere subsidiary of the Bank of England.
Of course, it has not been possible to study all the documents relevant to
this subject. Documents of territorial departments of the Colonial Office12
Money and the End of Empire
have been sifted, but used only sparingly. This material is essentially con­
cerned with the management of the day-to-day administration of individ­
ual colonies and sheds little light on the underpinnings of British imperial
policy. 36 It also appeared justifiable to exclude private records of prime
ministers and colonial secretaries. The present study is not concerned with
the ‘official mind’ of these actors per se, though readers should be able to
gauge much information about the dramatis personae from the notes. The
use of Commonwealth archives and the in-depth use of US archives, would
have allowed certain aspects of the study to be documented even more
fully. 37 It should, however, be emphasized that the study does not claim to
investigate all aspects of imperial economic policy, but only those that can
be said to have been crucial in supporting Britain’s overall management of
her external economic relations. This limit ties in with the focus put on the
exploration of certain territories on the periphery rather than all peripheral
territories equally. Finally, the relationship between Britain and the United
States has only been incorporated where it can be shown to have affected
Britain’s relations with the empire, or where it constrained or eased British
imperial policy. In all these cases, the ultimate defence is that this is one
book and not the several needed to do full justice to this vast and complex
problem.
The presentation advances the story in chronological chapters dealing
with the problem as a whole rather than in chapters dealing with different
subject areas or territories. The main body of the book is divided into four
parts of two chapters each. Britain’s imperial legacy and the essential issues
of imperial economic relations during the period under review are depicted
in the first part (chapters 2 and 3). The bulk of the study then discusses
changes in the imperial relationship and the logic behind British imperial
policy. Part II (chapters 4 and 5) covers the discriminatory sterling area dur­
ing the structural sterling crises of 1947, 1949 and 1951, when Britain’s
link with the empire converged. Part III (chapters 6 and 7) deals with
Britain’s deliberate move towards integration in a liberal economic world
order from 1953–56, when her relationship with the empire diverged. Part
IV (chapters 8 and 9) marks the move towards the convertibility of sterling
in 1958 and beyond into the 1960s, during which time Britain’s relation­
ship with empire was stretched until formal control was finally abandoned.
Each of these chapters will start with individual sections treating the struc­
tural conditions of the imperial relationship; subsequent sections will
integrate this context with an analysis of British policy. The conclusion
(chapter 10) provides a synopsis of Britain’s imperial relations during the
period and offers an interpretion of the end of the British empire.Part I
Britain, Finance and Empire2
Sterling, Britain’s Imperial Relations
and the Wider World: The Legacy
Britain exhibited a number of peculiarities in her polity, state, institutions,
economy, policy process and policy orthodoxies. 1 The role of the pound
sterling in the international economy hinged upon, and in turn affected,
these features. The legacy of this singularity can be traced in its impact on
Britain’s imperial relations via the colonial state and institution-building,
and the integration of colonies in the international economy. The rele­
vance to British policy designs of socio-economic and political pressures in
the empire is also explicable within this context. However, sterling rela­
tionships changed between the mid-nineteenth century and the post-1945
period, from Britain’s sterling-based cosmopolitanism to the discriminatory
sterling area within narrower geographical confines. This was due to exter­
nal competition from the United States and Europe, but also resulted from
changes in economic relations with the Commonwealth and the empire.
These changes need to be grasped in order to place Britain’s imperial rela­
tions during the 1940s and 1950s in the broader chronological context.
Moreover, the particular legacy of the discriminatory management of ster­
ling during the Second World War influenced, in various ways, Britain’s
imperial relations during global economic liberalization. Britain’s past ster­
ling relations and their accoutrements in the empire set both constraints
and offered opportunities for Britain’s broader designs in her external eco­
nomic policy after 1945.
1. Britain’s singularity
The way Britain was organized and embedded in the international economy
and international state system had a bearing on her foreign and imperial
relations. 2 The British polity was characterized by the important role over­
seas economic relations had played over the centuries in creating wealth in
Britain. Within this context a disparity had developed between the export
concerns of British manufacturing and the City of London’s pursuit of
overseas investment and the financing of international trade and services.
1516
Money and the End of Empire
A corollary of the latter was the British government’s managing of sterling
as the world’s principal currency of international transactions. The British
polity exhibited a marked divide. One social and political web was allied to
British manufacturing in the Midlands and the North of England, while
another was associated with the financial and service sectors of the econ­
omy based in London and the South of England. These sectors boomed in
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Industry and finance did
not become integrated in the sense of Hilferding’s finance capitalism. The
British financial sector kept aloof from industrial management focusing
instead on services and merchant banking. 3
The organization of the British state and its institutionalization reflects
the division of the British polity. Members of Parliament included a num­
ber of business representatives. However, the British civil service consti­
tuted an entity apart. The service recruited among Oxbridge graduates and
sections of British society related to the financial sector rather than among
business and manufacturing, and was horizontally markedly immobile. 4
The British state was weak but centralized and reflected the predilections of
free trade and laissez-faire ideas. Between the mid-nineteenth century and
the 1960s, this persuasion bore the characteristics of the pivotal role of the
financial sector in Britain’s external economic relations. In this sense,
British institutions had fossilized the ideas of earlier generations of British
economic management and are evidence of the balance of power in the
British polity. 5 Moreover, the absence of a written constitution underlay
the customary character of the management of the British state. The state’s
dominant institutions were those which played a role in the management
of Britain’s financial sector and sterling relationships. In principle, these
institutions were non-interventionist. When they intervened, they did so
in order to rectify perceived inadequacies in the ideal of a liberal global
economic order based on sterling. 6 Britain’s major institutions did not
merely fulfil a role in managing her external relations. Rather, the nature of
the British state and polity meant that overseas relations were essential in
the running of the state.
The British state controlled an economy which was importantly based on
generating income from the financing of international trade and services
and from overseas investment. The precise role of the financial sector in
advancing or hampering British economic growth is the subject of an
ongoing controversy. 7 However, the impact of financial concerns upon
Britain’s foreign relations is more clear-cut. Sterling relations influenced
British foreign policy since they required the maintenance of a strong and
stable exchange rate for sterling and of a high level of British capital
exports, not least to the overseas members of the sterling group. Moreover,
sterling’s role as an international currency, in order to be maintained,
necessitated a continually wide use of the pound in international trade
and as a reserve currency. These prerequisites shaped policy priorities.Sterling, Imperial Relations and the Wider World 17
Therefore, in the nineteenth century Britain strove to cement the link of
sterling to gold, and paid particular attention to the form of the currency
system in overseas territories. During the interwar period, Britain aimed at
promoting a sterling standard faced with mounting competition and exter­
nal imbalances in the depression.
In institutional terms, the peculiarity of the British polity attributed a pri­
mordial role to the Treasury and the Bank of England (formally independent
until 1945). 8 Both had been guardians of British financial stability since the
eighteenth century. 9 These institutions had acquired even greater promi­
nence by the mid-nineteenth century; their influence eclipsed government
departments, such as the Board of Trade, when sterling’s and the London
money market’s international role mounted. The strongest section within
the Treasury dealt with overseas finance. The Bank watched over cos­
mopolitan sterling, while the Treasury put greater emphasis on possible
repercussions from sterling relations for the British Exchequer. In a refined
capitalist world, this management grew in complexity. Compared to these
institutions, the Colonial and Dominion Offices were merely subordinate
regional departments in the government machinery.
External financial policy was first and foremost managed by the Bank of
England. A disproportionate influence in policy formulation, therefore, fell
to a certain strand of technocrats. 10 This institutional asymmetry and the
resulting doctrinal bias became more obvious, when the state’s conscious
role in managing national economies increased in the twentieth century.
Bank and Treasury officials wielded in many instances greater influence
than politicians since the management of sterling required tackling techni­
calities with which members of Parliament had only a passing acquaintance
or in which they were not interested. Moreover, much of this policy-making
had no proper procedures of accountability or clearly defined legal basis.
This was even true of Britain’s central arrangements in external economic
organization, such as the sterling area. 11 Parliamentary control in external
economic and imperial relations did not exist in the sense that policy
required Parliamentary approval. Members of Parliament merely used their
position to survey developments on a sporadic basis. Permanent or ad hoc
interdepartmental committees decided over the management of external
economic relations; the Treasury and the Bank contributed key representa­
tives and often the chairperson. The Governor of the Bank of England had
frequent regular meetings with the Chancellor. The Chancellor was Britain’s
most important Cabinet minister, after the Prime Minister and the Foreign
Secretary. 12 Given the institutional peculiarities, doctrinal orthodoxies in
external economic policy slanted towards analysing Britain’s economic
problems from the angle of sterling relationships. The same is true of self-
contained legally or quasi-legally defined areas of economic management.
Britain effected economic adjustment externally rather than via domestic
economic policy and industrial restructuring. Policy-makers, on the whole,18
Money and the End of Empire
saw capital exports as the sine qua non of British economic policy. They were
reluctant to compromise Britain’s adherence to the gold standard and the
maintenance of sterling at a sometimes artificially high rate. 13
By the 1940s and 1950s, the fundamental characteristics of the British
polity of the late nineteenth century were still visible, though the nature of
the British state had changed in a number of respects and operated in an
international context that differed considerably from the prewar period.
The British state still exhibited the traditional free trade principles in its
institutions and policies. However, manufacturing became briefly more
influential under Labour at the end of the 1940s, and in the late 1950s, the
British liberal state became more inclined towards corporatism. The state
now also needed to accommodate the demands of a wider spectrum of the
population which participated in the political process and which could not
be marginalized as it had been in the 1930s. The remodelling of the British
party system since the 1920s reflected this trend. 14 In the 1940s, Labour
represented a political establishment that was antagonistic to the tradi­
tional British state, and advocated a stronger more interventionist state.
However, in the 1950s, when the Tories regained power, the antagonism
between the institutional and political establishment had again disap­
peared, though by that time some form of systematic economic planning
had become a received necessity of the management of modern states. 15
Moreover, at times of severe economic crises even the traditional advocates
and institutions of the inherently liberal British state condoned interven­
tionist policies.
In the 1940s and 1950s, Britain was confronted with unprecedented and
vexed problems of economic recovery. Considerable structural and specula­
tive external imbalances coincided with impediments in domestic produc­
tion and international liquidity shortages. The traditional prerequisites of
the management of the British state were seriously affected: sterling was
inconvertible; the performance of the London money market was impe­
ded; the pound was weak and its very role as an international currency
doubtful. 16 During the period, the Treasury and the Bank retained and
even enhanced their dominant position in crisis management, and accom­
modated new needs of economic management. In 1947, a statistics office
was added to the Treasury’s already sizeable Overseas Finance Division. 17
Over a period in the late 1940s, the whole machinery of economic man­
agement of Britain and her dependencies became integrated in one
Ministry of Economic Affairs. Within this framework the Colonial Office
became also institutionally part of Britain’s overall economic manage-
ment. 18 However, in the 1950s Britain returned to a more informal cooper­
ation and coordination in the traditional committees, of which the
Economic Policy Committee and the Economic Steering Committee were
the most important. These committees also addressed imperial issues
in so far as they mattered for wider British policy considerations.Sterling, Imperial Relations and the Wider World 19
On the whole, British policy orthodoxies regarding sterling relations
proved very resistant. Even during the crises of the 1940s and 1950s, Britain
adopted no coherent strategy in overcoming the formidable obstacles to
extricate policy from the various burdensome legacies of her external finan­
cial relations.
2. Imperial management
The British empire formed part of the network of external economic rela­
tionships that were essential to the management of the British economy.
However, the form and extent of this integration and the importance for
Britain of imperial territories varied widely. In India, manufacturing and a
unified currency and local money market existed already in the nineteenth
century, 19 when Africa’s integration into the international monetary econ­
omy had just begun. 20 India was a pillar of British sterling relations in the
nineteenth century and again in the interwar period. From the early twen­
tieth century, the British also gradually established the appropriate institu­
tions and legal provisions to make Africa a useful part of Britain’s external
economic relations. In the new African empire (outside the areas of settle­
ment in Kenya and Rhodesia), colonial rule worked more by its potential
power than by its visible presence. At this early stage, the role of the colo­
nial state was to facilitate the activities of British firms, active in colonial
commodity trade, rather than playing an interventionist role in economic
development. In addition, from 1900, colonial states started to fulfil a
function for British sterling relations in providing low-risk outlets for
British investors.
The major institutional innovation that Britain introduced in the newly
acquired (and some old) colonies were the currency boards. 21 Their purpose
lay in encouraging commerce by regulating the medium of exchange and
maintaining the value of the local currency. The British substituted the het­
erogeneous indigenous currencies in use at that time (ranging from cloth to
cowrie shells and gold dust) with colonial currencies pegged to sterling. Put
crudely, the currency board arrangements provided for an automatic link of
the colony’s money supply with its export earnings, and, moreover, fully
backed the colonial currency in circulation with sterling. The Crown Agents
of the colonies in London (a quasi-governmental institution) managed the
investments of the bulk of the ensuing currency funds. 22
Another innovation was the colonial marketing institutions that emerged
in various forms in the interwar period in those territories in which
smallholder commodity production rather than plantation production
prevailed. 23 Their role was again to guarantee the smooth functioning of
the export trade and to negotiate production and pricing between local pro­
ducers and big British export firms. A notable difference existed between
West and East Africa. While in East Africa the (mainly) settler producer was20
Money and the End of Empire
at the same time the exporter, in West Africa the trader was the exporter of
commodities. As a result, the need to level out volatile world prices might
have been greater in West Africa; this may partly account for the more
active role that colonial governments there assumed in price stabilization
from the 1930s. 24
The integration of peripheral territories in the global economy followed
various paths during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 25
However, the principal commodities in Britain’s African and South-East
Asian empire were introduced or promoted by the British during the move
from slave production to legitimate commerce in the second half of the
nineteenth century. These commodities were meant to substitute those
previously produced by slave labour, notably cotton. The most profitable
exports, among a wide range of crops, included cocoa in West Africa and
rubber in Malaya. Cocoa remained a crucial commodity in the Gold Coast
and Western Nigeria (besides groundnuts in Northern Nigeria and palm oil
in Eastern Nigeria) from the early twentieth century to the present day,
though in Nigeria it suffered from the oil boom of the 1970s. Malayan rub­
ber production was of great importance for Britain from the early twentieth
century, and even in the 1950s and 1960s offered considerable resistance to
rising competition from synthetic production. 26
The orthodoxies of economic policy, that became entrenched in the
Colonial Office and among colonial officials, and the administration of
institutions reflected Britain’s concerns with smooth and lucrative trade
relations and their monetary underpinnings. Control of the colonial mone­
tary mechanism was centralized. The currency boards were administered in
London, or in some cases by British officials in the respective colonies. The
Colonial Secretary issued colonial currency provisions by decree, while the
colonial governor, even in the 1950s, held no authority in these matters.
The Colonial Stocks Act of 1900 was designed to offer British institutional
investors an outlet and channel finance to the colonies. 27 On other matters
of substance in colonial economic policy, the local administration received
instructions in circular letters from the Colonial Secretary on an ad hoc
basis. The Colonial Office had previously cleared the course of policy with
the Treasury.
British colonial rule in Africa in the early twentieth century and ‘indirect’
rule in the 1920s exhibited a minimalist economic policy, sometimes
labelled ‘caretaking’. 28 Moreover, British economic policy did not amount
to the management of resources for a colonial ‘national’ economy. Policy
was principally concerned with advocating economic austerity and foster­
ing savings in their own right, which later became also visible in the run­
ning of the marketing boards. Colonial officials thought that their colonial
subjects were not predisposed to the British ideal of homo economicus. The
British left the promotion of commodity production to incentives produced
by external demand, smallholder initiative or private export arrangements.Sterling, Imperial Relations and the Wider World 21
At the same time, the British excluded expatriate firms from production
in the West African colonies, and from the 1930s the colonial state, to
an increasing degree, shielded African production from market forces.
Colonial commodity production went through stormy periods during the
1930s depression. 29 An important example is the Gold Coast that wit­
nessed a series of cocoa hold-ups by local farmers dissatisfied with the
prices imposed on them by expatriate traders and constrained to raise cash
for taxes levied on them. 30 These protests risked upsetting the territory’s
export performance, and ultimately provoked the colonial government to
intervene. In the following, colonial economic policy in Africa became
shaped by fears of social and political conflict and coloured by a social
imperialist ideology of development and by state intervention with an agri­
cultural bias. 31
The conditions for colonial economic policy varied considerably across
the British empire. None the less, there existed important similarities with
regard to those territories acquired at the end of the nineteenth century.
Their economies were still based on exports of primary commodities,
whereas in the independent Commonwealth and India, local manufactur­
ing and indigenous business interests had given rise to diversified capitalist
economies. This made imperial management a delicate affair and made it
difficult to reconcile local political claims with policy designs of the
Treasury and Bank of England in Britain. This case is borne out by India in
particular. 32 After the Second World War, India and the independent
Commonwealth lost much of their earlier uses for Britain’s external eco­
nomic policy. On the other hand, within the specific framework of the dis­
criminatory sterling area, Britain’s African empire became not only firmly
integrated with British sterling policy, but a pillar of the sterling system.
However, the ‘minor’ empire itself propped up the sterling area only for a
short while. For various reasons, its importance for Britain’s external eco­
nomic relations faded after 1958. 33
After the Second World War, the British remodelled the colonial state.
Political organization became more elaborate in many colonial territories,
and the colonial administration had to meet these challenges. 34 However,
this pressure was not equally strong across the empire and in many territo­
ries independence was not expected to be obtained for decades. Moreover,
political reform was not matched by local participation in economic, espe­
cially monetary and financial, institutions. Economic and currency matters
remained the prerogatives of British government departments until the for­
mal move of individual territories to independence. For most of the period,
the currency boards operated in the orthodox way with full currency cover.
The West African marketing boards maintained their official majorities
until the mid-1950s. On the whole, Britain retained considerable leverage
over the policy formulation and execution where and when it mattered for
her requirements in external economic relations. This was notably the case22
Money and the End of Empire
in West Africa and Malaya from the end of the war to the mid-1950s. The
requirements of the discriminatory sterling area greatly increased the role
of colonial governments in planning and supervising trade flows and
expenditure. At the same time, the African colonies and Malaya retained
their predominant economic structure as commodity producers. This sup­
ported Britain’s management of the sterling area because it minimized
competing interests in trade. Moreover, boom prices, notably for cocoa and
rubber, were useful for discriminatory sterling management. The British
were also able to use political reform as a surrogate for changes in eco­
nomic institutions and management.
Prior to the Second World War, there existed no elected legislative or
executive mechanisms by which local opinion was formally associated with
the running of the colonial state. The native authorities diverted local griev­
ances away from the centre of the colonial state. They constituted no step
towards a wider political participation of the local population. Still, local
resistance to Britain’s integration of the African colonies into the global
monetary economy at the beginning of the twentieth century soon with­
ered away. 35 Before the war, local political organizations encompassed only
a small part of the urban colonial population and took the form of welfare
associations rather than parties. After the war, Britain created elected politi­
cal institutions, notably the Legislative Assemblies, which in the big
colonies moved towards unofficial majorities in the course of the 1950s. 36
None the less, the Fabian-inspired design of imperial socialism after
1945, 37 gave rise to a strong colonial state. Unlike under ‘indirect’ rule,
this state now fostered and associated itself with political elites that mar­
ginalized local agents of economic change and diversification in the politi­
cal arena, at least temporarily, by drawing on a diverse political power base
and smallholder support. However, prospects for commodities in general
and rubber in particular diminished by the end of the 1950s, while eco­
nomic liberalization prompted local demands for a more active promotion
of industries. The well-entrenched British colonial doctrine of economic
gradualism with its implicit austerity and emphasis on small-scale agricul­
tural development ironically facilitated the discriminatory management of
the sterling area. Yet, during the 1950s this orthodoxy had difficulty in fol­
lowing the twists and turns of British policy guidelines once the sterling
area began to be liberalized. On the whole, a distinct pattern of colonial
policy and imperial design shaped Britain’s relations with the colonies.
However, external constraints were influential, too.
3. Sterling relations in context
The pound had played an important role in the world economy since the
nineteenth century. Sterling had been closely allied to gold as the guaran­
tor of its value and confidence booster for its users, and Britain was keenSterling, Imperial Relations and the Wider World 23
on sustaining the international gold standard. 38 Such was Britain’s success
that, in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, gold-based sterling
became hugely and singularly popular as an international currency of trade
and reserves, and preferred to gold itself. In the period 1871–1913, the
international financial system was effectively a sterling system. By that
time, the London money market had become the world’s main capital
exporter. The financial services provided by the City of London boosted
this role, even when Britain’s visible trade diminished. Sterling was conve­
nient for many countries not least because British capital exports went pri­
marily to those areas from which the bulk of commodity trade towards
Britain and Europe originated. From the mid-nineteenth century down to
the First World War, Britain settled imbalances with the United States and
Europe mainly by invisible surpluses derived from the Commonwealth,
and by Indian surpluses which India had derived from trade with China. 39
The Indian rupee’s link to sterling, but not directly to gold, moreover,
smoothed Britain’s management of the gold standard. This arrangement
permitted Britain to adjust imbalances by checking the counter-cyclical
effects of India’s appetite for gold, thus supporting liquidity in a recession
but restraining it in a boom. 40
In the interwar period, the international financial system became diversi­
fied and also more volatile, and impeded the global functioning of the
gold/sterling standard as it operated before the First World War. 41 New York
competed as a financial centre with London. International settlements
became more difficult because the close link that previously had existed
between the areas of capital exports and trade flows was broken. The
United States attracted more trade flows from the periphery, whereas the
direction of her capital exports remained the same. Moreover, the British
manufacturing base had suffered as a result of the war. When Britain none
the less returned to the gold standard in 1925, this had its costs in terms of
a sterling exchange rate which disadvantaged British manufacturing. The
depression of the 1930s brought the sterling system under further pressure
and increased protectionist tendencies. In 1931, sterling was forced off gold
and adopted a ‘managed’ float. 42 But, in spite of mounting external compe­
tition and economic adversity, British capital exports persisted at a consid­
erable level in the interwar period. Britain was able to adhere to an
international sterling system, even if only within a regional framework.
Britain retreated into the management of the sterling bloc which encom­
passed Britain, the empire and Commonwealth (except Canada), and a
number of other mainly European and Middle Eastern countries. 43 These
countries used sterling as a reserve and trading currency and obtained pref­
erential access to the London money market. At the outbreak of the Second
World War, sterling retreated one step further when Britain suspended con­
vertibility in 1939. This measure marked the beginning of the discrimina­
tory sterling group commonly known as the sterling area. 4424
Money and the End of Empire
Meanwhile, Britain’s sterling system also created its own problems.
Recipients of British capital on the periphery required commodity prices
that allowed these territories to service their debts. In this respect the situa­
tion was not favourable in the interwar period. Alternatively, the creation
and expansion of a manufacturing base on the periphery might fulfil a role
in debt servicing. In the British case, preferential arrangements had, among
others, a role to play in supporting Britain’s overseas sterling relationships
in this way. 45 But this option was often difficult to reconcile with pressures
within Britain from protectionist groups, notably Manchester cotton. 46 In
addition, this strategy, to the extent that it was based on imperial prefer­
ence, assumed that the Commonwealth’s most desirable market was of
necessity Britain. However, the sheer volume of many Commonwealth
products might well require other outlets. 47 In the case of India, local man­
ufacturing circles were, furthermore, opposed to Britain’s management of a
high rupee and avoidance of a ‘proper’ gold standard for India. 48 None the
less, during the interwar period, Britain was still able to keep these prob­
lems at bay.
But, by the 1940s, external pressures on Britain’s sterling system had sub­
stantially increased. During the Second World War, the United States had
the advantage that its manufacturing base remained unimpeded by direct
war events. More importantly, after the war the United States emerged from
its self-imposed isolationism to play an active part in international organiza­
tion and advocated economic multilateralism. While Britain went through a
phase of difficult postwar recovery, the United States took on the role of the
world’s chief creditor, and the dollar’s role as a trading and reserve currency
grew. 49 Britain on her own found it difficult to keep up with the pace urged
by the United States to achieve global liberalization. None the less, she con­
tinued to have the ambition of re-establishing the pound as a world cur­
rency, which, by definition, required multilateral global trade.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Britain was challenged from other quarters, too.
International capital flows diversified and their importance for the world
economy increased. This undermined further the international role of ster­
ling and the London money market. At that time, confidence in sterling
was shaken by Britain’s balance of payments difficulties, related doubts
about the stability of the exchange rate, and the heavy (potential or real)
claims of the sterling balances. In addition, trade between industrialized
countries became more important and trade flows changed markedly from
the late 1950s. The Commonwealth, too, reoriented its import and export
markets away from Britain. 50 This upset the traditional balancing mecha­
nism of the sterling group and made it gradually redundant. At the same
time, a return to sterling cosmopolitanism had only limited success, and
the sterling area disintegrated during the 1960s.
For most of its history the sterling system had been based on relation­
ships with primary producers. From the late 1950s, however, Britain had toSterling, Imperial Relations and the Wider World 25
restructure her external economic relations in order to be able to compete
within the changed framework of the international economy. This require­
ment was heightened by the fierce competition that emerged from the
major economies of continental Europe, now organized in the Common
Market. British manufacturing could not remain aloof from this trend. 51
Sterling still played some role as an international currency. However, its
importance was seriously reduced, especially after the devaluation of 1967
and the foreign reserve crisis of 1976. 52 In 1939 the situation had been very
different. The establishment of a discriminatory sterling area appeared to
be a powerful way of keeping sterling afloat as an international currency,
while at the same time sustaining the allied war effort.
4. Discrimination in wartime
The outbreak of the Second World War created peculiar circumstances for
Britain’s external economic relations. The additional burden on the British
economy required cooperation with and some form of assistance from the
United States. 53 At the same time, Britain introduced tight measures of eco­
nomic planning and austerity at home and in the colonies in order to
avoid a wasteful use of resources. The imperial segment proved to be a
valuable asset in Britain’s management of the discriminatory sterling area
without which her war effort would have been much reduced. During the
war, the independent Commonwealth and other independent countries
with close ties to sterling played a similar role. 54
The most important wartime contribution of the sterling periphery was
the accumulation of sterling balances, which resulted from the provision of
supplies to Britain and the boosting of commodity exports to destinations
in the dollar area while cutting down imports, sometimes very severely. To
finance the war, Britain heavily relied on the empire and Commonwealth.
The accumulation of sterling debts in the sterling area was an important
supplement to the use of British foreign exchange reserves and to the lend-
lease and reciprocal aid arrangements. The latter mutually allocated sup­
plies between the United States and the allies (including the empire and
Commonwealth), which meant that no debts were incurred. However,
these provisions required a constant bargaining with the United States and
prompted unwelcome linkages, such as demands by the United States that
Britain would comply with non-discriminatory trade after the war. By con­
trast, via the sterling area Britain was able to postpone debt settlements
until after the war, though such a delay of consumption by member coun­
tries also burdened a postwar settlement and made it politically tricky. 55
India was the pillar of these wartime arrangements in terms of man­
power and production, enabling Britain to accumulate huge Indian sterling
debts. The subcontinent maintained and supplied the Indian army and
provided small arms and clothing for the allied armies, while Britain26
Money and the End of Empire
financed operational costs outside India. In 1943, these arrangements were
extended to raw materials and food. At the same time, India sustained
severe import restrictions, which were in part responsible for the Bengal
famine. In addition, the Indian army played a pivotal role in the allies’ mil­
itary campaigns in Asia. India was crucial in carrying Britain through the
war financially rather than being a burden, Churchill’s assertion to the
contrary notwithstanding. 56
Meanwhile, in her African colonies, Britain put emphasis on dollar sav­
ing and was reluctant to introduce planned arrangements for supply dur­
ing the early phase of the war. Copper was one of the few strategic minerals
available in Britain’s African empire. The British bought the annual copper
output of Northern Rhodesia. 57 Similarly, Malayan rubber was an impor­
tant strategic resource in the early period of the war. South African gold
eased the British debt burden towards the United States. The fall of France
then gave higher priority to the rapid procurement of resources. Japanese
advances in the Far East, notably the occupation of Malaya and the threat
to India after 1942, further enhanced the role of the African empire. Britain
now emphasized sisal and food production in East Africa. 58 After the
United States’ entry into the war, Anglo-American cooperation was
extended to the use of African resources. From 1942, combined Boards for
supply controlled hard fibres, tin, rubber and oilseed. After 1942 local
administrations bought colonial export crops in order to guarantee sup­
plies for Britain or the agreed allocation within the Anglo-American
arrangements. The joint system made it difficult for Britain to control colo­
nial trade as she saw fit. 59
None the less, Britain’s African empire emerged as a growth area of
resources, and thus also for the accumulation of sterling balances. With the
Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1940, Britain departed from the
earlier principle of colonial self-sufficiency. However, infrastructural and
welfare investments in the colonies during the war were a calculated move
by Britain to increase efficiency in production and supply arrangements for
wartime uses. The British ensured that the state’s agency in development
was soon compensated by revenue from the colonies’ commodity
exports. 60 The British also debated colonial industrialization in order to fos­
ter import-substituting production. But such initiatives were aborted;
instead, efforts focused on commodity schemes. 61
When the war ended in 1945, Britain’s economy was shattered and her
balance of payments problems, rife since the depression of the 1930s, had
worsened. Britain had accumulated considerable overseas sterling balances
which effectively indebted her to the empire and Commonwealth. This
indebtedness cushioned the British balance of payments, 62 but also consti­
tuted future claims on British resources burdening the move towards a lib­
eralized international economic order. The situation was particularly acute
with respect to India, which in 1945 held over one-third of Britain’s totalSterling, Imperial Relations and the Wider World 27
sterling balances. 63 Britain’s African empire held balances that were judged
at the time to be substantial. But they were still fairly low compared with
what followed after 1947. 64 During the war, Britain already had made con­
cessions towards India allowing it to hold (limited) dollar and gold
reserves. After 1945, a solution of the debt problem proved difficult.
Britain’s exports were unable to meet the demands to which the balances
amounted, and the cancellation of the balances proved politically impossi­
ble, not least since Britain was faced with the increased political awareness
and improved organization of Indian nationalists. 65 The political move to
Indian independence probably eased the mounting tensions over the ster­
ling balances, and ought to be assessed in this context too.
In the aftermath of the war, Britain was confronted with a search for
financial assistance to prevent economic breakdown and to support recon­
struction. The United States was the obvious creditor, but proved to be a
reluctant one. 66 The balances issue created an uneasy situation between the
United States and Britain. The United States pressed for the cancellation of
Britain’s balances in order to allow international economic reform. Britain,
by contrast, saw the balances as a bargaining chip to put pressure on the
United States to be more forthcoming with credits. 67 The result was an
antagonistic alliance in the creation of the liberal postwar economic order.
The United States pushed forward. Britain, intent on regaining the upper
hand in the international financial system, manoeuvred carefully in order
to obtain the breathing space she required for economic recovery. 68
5. Conclusion
The peculiar legacy of the British state attributed a key role to sterling rela­
tions in Britain’s foreign economic relations. This fact is relevant to the
analysis of Britain’s imperial relations in the 1940s and 1950s in three main
ways. Britain’s institutional framework, policy process and orthodoxies,
underpinned and coloured imperial policy as part of her overall external
relations. Moreover, the legacy of colonial institutions, colonial rule and
the socio-economic and political conditions in the empire constrained or
eased Britain’s external economic management. Finally, constraints and
opportunities also emanated from external factors, notably the interna­
tional economy and Britain’s position as the hub of international financial
and trade relations. These factors had the potential both to alter Britain’s
structural relations with the empire and to undermine her policy objec­
tives. This linkage, therefore, needs to be explored in a systematic way. In
all three areas, a noticeable transformation occurred between 1947 and
1958, even if some of these changes may appear less significant when set
within a broader time frame. Britain’s external (economic) relations and
imperial relations were very different at the beginning of the 1960s from
what they had been in 1947 or during the interwar period.28
Money and the End of Empire
An understanding of the singularity of Britain and the associated legacy
of sterling relations is essential for the study’s main argument about the
causes of change in Britain’s imperial link in the 1940s and 1950s. 69 More­
over, a better comprehension of this discussion requires some knowledge of
the key economic data concerning Britain’s imperial relationships during
the peacetime period of the discriminatory sterling area. The following
chapter surveys this dimension.3
Britain, the Sterling Area and
the Empire: Key Economic
Relationships, 1947–58
A survey of the structure of Britain’s imperial economic relations between
1947 and 1958, and of changes in the quantitative and regional importance
of the pertinent data, will facilitate the understanding of the study’s argu­
ment about the connection between British imperial policy and financial
politics. The aim is to give a synopsis that is not readily available elsewhere,
to which readers can return for reference. 1
Recent research on the sterling area has presented the pertinent statistics
on the sterling balances and sterling area capital flows, 2 while studies of
colonial development have established valuable statistics on colonial
trade 3 . However, the former investigation does not enter into the details of
imperial sterling relations, while the latter strands of research focus on the
periphery and are not part of an analysis of Britain’s management of the
imperial sterling area. Contemporary and near-contemporary publications
have proved helpful in formulating the argument of this chapter. 4 These
studies provide evidence about general sterling area relationships, espe­
cially the sterling balances, 5 and often touch upon the political dimen-
sion. 6 None the less, specific issues relating to the empire can only be
analysed authoritatively on the basis of archival documents.
Some economic technicalities have crucial political implications, as is the
case with the sterling balances of individual colonies, the liquidity of colo­
nial investment funds and the official judgement of ‘excess’ balances. 7 The
analysis will quantify and explain these specific issues after setting out the
wider context of Britain’s problems in external economic relations, 8 and of
colonial trade and capital relations. Our investigation adapts rather than
adopts statistics from archival and official sources, but indicates where con­
temporary scholarly comment is available and applicable. 9 For the purpose
of this study, emphasis will be put on issues that entered the general policy
evaluation and performance issues closely related to it; issues relevant to the
performance debate in its own right and many specific technicalities of eco­
nomic management cannot be addressed. In the simplest terms, the period
falls into two main parts. The period 1947–53 was marked by discriminatory
2930
Money and the End of Empire
economic policies, while a gradual liberalization took place in the years
down to sterling’s convertibility in 1958.
1. Britain and the international economy
In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War Britain’s economy
was on the verge of collapse. As a centre of the management and financing
of international trade, Britain required a large and secure reserve position.
But, in 1945, reserves were virtually depleted and Britain was heavily in
debt. Moreover, Britain suffered from structural problems in her balance of
payments. These factors combined to provoke repeated sterling payments
crises, of which the most severe were the convertibility crisis in 1947, the
devaluation of the pound by 30 per cent in 1949, and the crisis in 1951. 10
The level of Britain’s reserves in gold and convertible currencies, mainly
dollars, was particularly low following the crisis of 1947. It was again under
severe pressure during the Suez crisis in 1956, and improved significantly
only in the late 1950s. 11 Britain’s overall balance of payments on current
account was volatile during the period. According to the official view, an
annual surplus of between £200 million and £350 million was required to
support sterling’s role as a currency of international trade. 12 However, this
aim was never achieved, though Britain came close to the target in 1950
and 1958. 13 During the period 1947–56, Britain’s invisible balance per­
formed significantly better than her visible balance. 14 In the late 1940s,
Britain had one fundamental difficulty with her balance of payments:
while she was carrying surpluses with the overseas sterling area, she was
running considerable deficits on her account with the dollar area. This situ­
ation reflected the well-known European dollar shortage. 15 The current
deficits became less marked as the 1950s wore on, and turned into sur­
pluses in 1958 and 1959. 16 At the same time, Britain’s dollar gap levelled
out. But, in the late 1940s and early 1950s Britain was highly dependent
upon external credit arrangements to improve her balance of payments
and cushion her reserves in the short term. This was even more necessary
because she had committed herself at Bretton Woods, and bound herself in
the Anglo-American loan agreement of 1945, to make sterling convertible.
In the long term, a strategy had to be sought that would tackle the balance
of payments and reserve problems, as well as problems on the capital side
epitomized by potential claims of huge short-term liabilities in the form of
overseas sterling balances. 17
From 1947 to 1953, Britain managed her critical balance of payments
and reserve position by external means while maintaining cheap money
policies at home and relied heavily on the sterling area, which formed a
common currency bloc with Britain. 18 After 1953, internal economic man­
agement ultimately prevailed in stabilizing the balance of payments and
reserves position by means of a stringent Bank Rate. 19 The sterling crises ofKey Economic Relationships, 1947–58 31
1955 and 1958 were different in kind from the earlier ones, since they were
due to speculative flows under conditions of de facto (non-resident) con­
vertibility of sterling on current account. Meanwhile, the discriminatory
management of the sterling area subsided. However, Britain sought to re­
establish some form of sterling area under conditions of liberalized trade
and payments in anticipation of official sterling convertibility, eventually
introduced in 1958. 20
Britain’s discriminatory external economic policies in the 1940s and early
1950s, and the move towards convertibility, hinged on her relations with
the United States. What mattered for Britain’s external economic relations,
because of her current account problems, was the dollar area as a market,
the United States as a source of credits, and indirect financial assistance via
defence cooperation. What mattered, because of Britain’s problems on the
capital side of the balance of payments, was US cooperation on convertibil­
ity, or acquiescence to delay such action, and consequent support in the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. 21
Other non-sterling relations that were of growing importance for Britain
during the period were those with Western Europe. In the late 1940s,
Britain needed to solve the problem of the siphoning of gold reserves into
the then powerful Belgian economy. Subsequently, Britain became bound
up more closely with Europe as a result of the Marshall Aid arrangements
and the creation of the European Payments Union (EPU) in 1950. Within
this context a noteworthy surplus problem developed immediately after
the foundation of the EPU. European relations again became more impor­
tant for Britain from the mid-1950s as inter-industrial trade was on the
increase. They also became more problematic, when initiatives on the
continent towards the creation of a common market had the potential of
disturbing Britain’s established trade and payments arrangements. 22
Britain’s economic relationships with the overseas sterling area gained
prominence during the period under review due to her weak position
within the international economy and vis-à-vis the non-sterling world.
Between 1939 and 1958, when sterling was legally inconvertible, payments
were settled multilaterally within the sterling area, while discrimination
occurred vis-à-vis the world’s other trading blocs, notably towards the dollar
area. Britain was at the centre of the sterling area’s clearing arrangements
and performed the role of banker to the area. Payments were based on ster­
ling. The currencies of member countries were pegged to sterling at a fixed
rate. Members held their currency reserves in sterling in London. Special
arrangements governed financial and monetary matters in colonies. 23
The nature of this discriminatory currency-cum-trading bloc makes it
essential to observe the development of overall trade flows and trade bal­
ances between Britain and the overseas sterling area, as well as between the
sterling group and the world’s other large trading blocs. Trade flows show
the changing relevance of the overseas sterling area for the British national32
Money and the End of Empire
economy, and also which parts of the sterling system constituted the pillars
and which parts were the beneficiaries of this multilateral clearing system.
Further indications of performance can be obtained from figures on
the current balance of payments of Britain, the sterling area and its con­
stituents. These general relationships will be discussed below, the empire’s
place in them in the subsequent sections.
The trend in Britain’s non-sterling trade flows experienced a notable
change between the mid-1940s and early 1960s. 24 The share of the value of
Britain’s total visible exports and imports towards Western Europe
increased, and North America and Europe together had overtaken in quan­
titative importance the sterling area as a market for British exports by the
end of the 1950s. 25 Britain’s importance for the overseas sterling area as a
whole as an import market remained roughly the same throughout the
1950s; her importance for the independent sterling area diminished. The
situation is more striking if one takes Britain’s importance as an export
market for the sterling area. However, Britain still remained the area’s sin­
gle most important trading partner. 26 The overseas sterling area’s current
balance of payments with the United States (Figure 3.1) (important because
of Britain’s need for dollars) showed a heavy deficit in 1947, slightly less
heavy deficits in the years 1948 and 1949, and surpluses from 1950.
However, the deficits of the overseas sterling area were less heavy than
those of Britain, and in 1951 the overseas sterling area was in surplus,
when Britain incurred a heavy deficit. 27 The independent overseas sterling

area’s balance with the United States was similar to that experienced by
Britain in the years 1947–50, though the independent sterling area had a
less heavy deficit than Britain in 1951. However, in the years 1952–54,
when Britain was in surplus, the independent overseas sterling area was in
deficit, and in 1954 heavily so. 28
Seen merely from the perspective of trade and payments flows there were
clear net debtors and net creditors in the sterling area. Marked variations
existed within the overseas sterling area as an examination of Britain’s rela­
tions with the dependent sterling area will show. On the whole, with
regard to the crucial non-sterling relations Britain was on the receiving end
during the periods of structural sterling crises. In so far as the overseas ster­
ling area’s performance in dollar and other hard currency markets, com­
pounded by checks on overall imports, was superior to that of Britain, it
constituted a means of supporting Britain’s national economy during a
period of crisis; in so far as its performance was inferior to that of Britain, it
exacerbated her problems. In the course of the 1950s, the economies of
Britain and the constituents of the independent sterling area became less
entwined as the dollar shortage eased. Moreover, independent members of
the sterling area, to an increasing extent, held their own gold and dollar
reserves. 29 But in the late 1940s and early 1950s the overseas sterling area
provided important support for Britain’s national economy. The essential
distinctive feature of sterling area arrangements during the period was
related to the capital side. The process and rate of accumulation of the ster­
ling balances, as well as changes in their regional distribution, suggest
important lines of enquiry regarding their accumulation. Moreover, a sur­
vey of the direction of overall overseas investment flows can serve as an
indicator of Britain’s priorities and capacity in pursuing her traditional role
as capital exporter, and can also clarify possible links with the accumula­
tion of the balances. 30
Since the mid-1920s, when Britain gradually moved from some form of
gold standard to what effectively became a sterling standard, independent
Commonwealth countries and the empire had been encouraged to hold
their currency reserves in sterling in London, rather than accumulating
gold reserves of their own. When the sterling bloc came into being in the
1930s, other countries joined it and held their reserves in London too.
Especially between 1939 and 1958, when sterling was officially not con­
vertible, large balances of overseas sterling area members accumulated in
London during periods of austere economic policies in member countries,
restrictive international trade policies and world commodity price booms.
This accumulation was principally due to ‘unrequited’ exports by sterling
area members, and also constituted a corollary of their pooling of earn­
ings of convertible foreign currency in lieu of themselves accumulating it.
The level of balances increased far beyond (in ‘excess’ of ) the trade and
reserve requirements of member countries. Moreover, sterling balances also34
Money and the End of Empire
accumulated because countries outside the sterling group with important
sterling trade relations held their working balances in London. 31
The sterling balances device and the pooling of reserves helped to sustain
the sterling area as a whole and contributed to ease Britain’s balance of
payments and reserve problems during and in the aftermath of the Second
World War. The effects and usefulness of this device depended, among
others, on the feasibility of trade discrimination and checks on converti­
bility or, alternatively, the commitment of member countries to maintain a
high level of balances by means of austerity policies or during boom
periods. The political management of the sterling balances was rather more
feasible within than outside the sterling group, and easier with respect to
dependent than with respect to independent constituents. However, a
political strategy regarding the balances presented inherent contradictions
in the long run and ideal conditions were unlikely to prevail. ‘Excess’ ster­
ling balances were ‘sound’ only as long as Britain’s reserve position was
equally ‘sound’. Otherwise, they entailed risks. They not only cushioned
Britain’s balance of payments but also concealed structural economic prob­
lems in Britain. Any faltering in confidence in the stability of the pound
(and, therefore, its suitability as a reserve currency) led to increased pres­
sure to reduce the ‘excess’ balances from overseas countries. Pressure could
materialize as fully-fledged reserve crises, as was the case in 1947, when a
move towards the convertibility of sterling was attempted. Withdrawals
were, in principle, possible at short call, since these were mostly reserves
held as short-term liabilities. However, the occasional self-restraint, due to
fears that the entire system might collapse, cannot be ruled out. Given
Britain’s feeble reserve position, Britain was vulnerable to pressure from
possible withdrawals. The situation then called for desperate counter-mea-
sures, such as agreements on the blocking of balances or the suspension of
imports. The alternative was, in the simplest terms, structural changes that
would improve Britain’s reserve and balance of payments position and
some reduction in the balances by way of funding them, or a controlled
reduction by instalments. A variation of the funding option, within the
framework of international economic management via the Bank of
International Settlements, was eventually implemented after the sterling
crisis of 1967. 32
The rate of accumulation of the overseas sterling balances during the
period suggests a distinction between the overall accumulation and that of
sterling area members (Figure 3.2), and, furthermore, a distinction between
independent and dependent members (discussed later in this chapter). 33
During the Second World War, the overall level of the sterling balances
increased about five-fold. But instead of a decrease after the war, the overall
balances accumulated further. Increases occurred in every year except in
those that developed sterling crises, when rapid withdrawals of overseas
sterling occurred that could not be sufficiently dampened by Britain’sKey Economic Relationships, 1947–58 35

reserves. The worst of these crises occurred in August 1947 and at the end
of 1951, when withdrawals of overall sterling balances by about 9 per cent
took place in both years. The years that show the highest annual rate of
accumulation were 1946–7 with 6 per cent, and 1949–50 with 8 per cent.
The balances of the overseas sterling area developed largely parallel to the
overall total, of which they constituted roughly 70 per cent in the period
1941–58. However, a distinction between the periods 1941–7 and 1947–58
shows a rate of accumulation of 69 per cent for both areas in the first
period, whereas in the second period the balances of the overseas sterling
area accumulated somewhat faster, namely by 13 per cent compared to
only 2 per cent for the overall total.
These figures are of interest within a comparative territorial setting. 34
The movements in the accumulation of sterling balances were rather more
striking for the ‘old’ Commonwealth countries, Australia and New Zealand.
(South Africa’s importance for the sterling area lay in its role as a gold
exporter, whereas it held only insignificant levels of balances.) The rate of
increase of this group over the period 1947–51 was about 68 per cent,
whereas there had been a decrease of 27 per cent between the end of the
war and the convertibility crisis. However, while the overall sterling area
balances remained at a high level thereafter, by the end of 1957 those of
the area’s independent part had been reduced to a level that was consid­
ered to be insufficient even for reserves purposes. 35 India shows a different
picture. Indian sterling balances continuously decreased from a very high
level in 1947, when they made up about one third of all overseas sterling36

balances, to an insignificant level that was judged as insufficient for reserve
purposes by the British.
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, when it mattered, increases in overseas
sterling balances contributed to financing Britain’s current account deficits
and to cushioning the reserves (Table 3.1). 36 The important deficit of 1947
was financed in the following way: 34 per cent by drawing on reserves, 1.6
per cent by borrowing, 6.8 per cent by grants to the United Kingdom and
57 per cent by increases in the sterling balances. In 1951, the current
deficit was augmented by heavy investment, and then financed by drawing
on the reserves (46 per cent), by grants to the United Kingdom (5.7 per
cent) and by increases in the sterling balances (49 per cent). In the years
when Britain’s current balance of payments was in surplus, increases in the
overseas sterling balances and foreign exchange earnings improved the
British reserve position in the following way. In 1949, such increases aug­
mented the funds available for investment or for cushioning reserves by
roughly 50 per cent, in 1950 by 35 per cent, in 1953 by 55 per cent and in
1954 by 29 per cent.
2. Colonial trade and payments relations
The colonies occupied a unique position in Britain’s relations with the
international economy and the overseas sterling area. They were locked
into the sterling area in a specific way due to the peculiarities of the colo­
nial financial and monetary arrangements. The empire constituted a pillarKey Economic Relationships, 1947–58 37
of the discriminatory sterling area during the 1940s and early 1950s, and
posed intricate problems in the second half of the 1950s, when the move
towards sterling convertibility and economic liberalization was undertaken.
The imperial sterling area’s performance in its trade with Britain and the
important non-sterling world was bound up with Britain’s imperial capital
relations, notably the accumulating sterling balances.
The balance of payments on current account can serve as one indicator
of colonial economic performance and also of the changing role of the
empire for Britain. However, emphasis here will be given to trade balances.
This is rather more feasible in view of available reliable statistics, 37 but can,
with circumspection, also be justified by the fact that commodity trade was
particularly important for the colonies. None the less, under certain condi­
tions, balance of payments and trade deficits followed a peculiar logic
within wider international settlement arrangements, and this should cau­
tion against any straightforward deduction of the importance of a region
for the sterling group from these variables alone. The following compara­
tive account is based on a colonial group comprising East Africa, West
Africa, the Malayan area and the West Indies. 38 Entrepôt centres and strate­
gic outposts will receive minor attention, as will, for specific reasons, the
Rhodesias.
The overall trade balance (Figure 3.3) of the so-defined colonial (and ex-
colonial) group exhibited minor surpluses in the years 1948 and 1954,
large surpluses in the years 1950 and 1951, minor deficits in the years
1947, 1949, 1952 and 1953, and somewhat larger deficits in the years from

1955 to 1959. 39 The West Indies were always in deficit as was East Africa,
except in the years 1950 and 1951. Malaya carried huge surpluses in 1950
and 1951, and minor ones in 1955 and 1959. West Africa was in consider­
able surplus from 1947 to 1954 and in modest deficit from 1955 onwards. 40
A measure of trade performance can be obtained by setting the value of
exports against that of imports in a given year (Table 3.2). A comparison of
the export/import ratios of different colonial sub-groups suggests that, in
terms of the area’s absolute trade performance, West Africa occupied the
first rank during the period 1947 to 1954, and during those years impor­
tantly contributed to the performance of the colonial group as a whole.
The assessment of the current balance of payments of the colonies is
more difficult than that of the simple trade balances. Within the responsi­
ble government departments, such calculations for the colonies were only
beginning to be undertaken at the end of the 1940s. 41 The main problem is
that invisibles were only inadequately accounted for in available calcula­
tions, even if the government departments concerned were aware of their
importance in certain cases. The problem was particularly acute in the
West Indies because of the tourist trade. Other omissions were defence
expenditure and grants. Moreover, the calculations available from the early
1950s often used overall totals (excluding Hong Kong) which make com­
parisons difficult. Figures for the period 1948–52 from official sources indi­
cate medium-sized deficits in 1948 and 1949, huge surpluses in 1950 and
1951, and a somewhat smaller surplus in 1952, as well as a modest deficit
in 1953. 42 The overall colonial balance was, then, roughly even until 1956,
when a somewhat heavier deficit occurred. However, it was expected to beKey Economic Relationships, 1947–58 39
roughly in balance thereafter. 43 Other available figures differ in that they
show a roughly balanced position for 1948, a modest deficit in 1952 and
rather larger deficits in 1953 and 1954. 44 A crude comparison with the
trade balance suggests that, not surprisingly, the colonial current balance
of payments was worse than the trade balance. However, the differences
seem not to have been marked. From a comparative perspective, the bal­
ance of payments of the colonial group, as a whole, and even more so of
certain colonial sub-groups, was better during the period of the late 1940s
and early 1950s than that of the independent sterling Commonwealth
except Australia. 45 This overall picture is, however, rather more striking
with regard to colonial non-sterling relations.
In view of the organization of international trade during the period and
Britain’s economic malaise, the performance of the colonial group in its
relations with the world’s main trading blocs outside the sterling area was
important. 46 On the whole, between 1948 and 1952, the colonies carried
huge surpluses in their current balance with the dollar area, and a modest
deficit with other non-sterling countries (notably OEEC). A slight surplus
existed with Britain, and a rather larger deficit exis-ted with the indepen­
dent sterling area. 47 This is radically different from the pattern of the
independent sterling area, where a deficit with Britain, and at the same
time a marked deficit with the dollar area, was the rule (Figure 3.4). 48 The
European dollar shortage during the 1940s and early 1950s suggests that
it is worthwhile looking more closely into patterns of colonial dollar
surpluses, colonial dollar receipts and expenditures, as well as trade flows.

Money and the End of Empire
The trade balance shows huge surpluses by the specified colonial group
with the dollar area in the years 1950–54, and considerable surpluses in the
late 1940s. The highest surpluses in absolute terms occurred with Malaya;
West Africa came next. By contrast, from the end of the war until 1949, and
in 1952, the independent sterling area carried heavy trade deficits with the
dollar world. 49 Similarly, the current balance of the overall colonial total, this
time with the United States alone, shows medium-sized surpluses in 1947
and in the years 1950–3. In 1954, the surplus soared to about twice the 1953
level. At the same time, the independent overseas sterling area experienced
enormous deficits in the years 1947–9, 1951, 1952 and 1954. The colonies
not merely eased the dollar balance of the overseas sterling area, they com­
pensated for the deficits incurred by its independent constituents. Between
1947 and 1952, the colonial contribution to the sterling area’s dollar pool
outweighed by 1.5 the drawings of independent members from the pool. 50
By far the largest dollar receipts from exports to the dollar area in the
specified colonial group were attributable to Malaya (Figure 3.5). During
the entire period between 1947 and 1953 the value of its imports reached
about two and a half times that of West Africa, which came second, and
amounted to about two-thirds of the total. West Africa made up about one
quarter. 51 Malaya’s level of expenditure on imports stood at about one-
third of the total. 52 The West African level was much lower, amounting to
only a little more than 10 per cent of the total. Between 1947 and 1953,

exports to the dollar area by the colonial group made up about one quarter
of exports to all areas in value terms, though slightly less than 20 per cent
in 1953. The important exporters were West Africa, Malaya and the West
Indies. East Africa was far less important. While the other areas exported
mostly to the United States, the most important markets for West Indian
exports were Latin America and Canada. Colonial export flows show no
striking reorientation during the period, and even a decrease in their share
towards dollar markets. The exceptionally low share of Malaya in 1951 is
noteworthy, as is that for West Africa in 1949.
However, during the same period noticeable changes occurred in import
flows from the dollar area by the colonial group (Figure 3.6). While total
imports for the West Indies were very high, imports by the three other
colonial areas were very low indeed and decreased markedly during the
period. In West Africa, the share of imports from the dollar area plum­
meted from slightly less than 20 per cent in 1947 to slightly above 10 per
cent of total imports in 1948, and to a share of between 5 and 6 per cent
for the remaining years. In East Africa, the pattern was similar. Malaya
experienced a slight increase between 1947 and 1948, but then saw its
share reduced by half in 1949, and halved again in 1950.
From the perspective of the functioning of the sterling area, a more
important measure for colonial relations with the dollar area than simple
changes in the comparative importance of import and export markets is the

colonies’ relative performance in value terms (Tables 3.3 and 3.4). Compared
to the base year 1947, the value of imports from dollar markets experienced
a drastic reduction. Overall imports increased by 2.5 in value between 1947
and 1953. But imports from the dollar area fell by about 8 per cent in the
same period, and lay considerably below that in the years between. They
stood at about three-quarters of the 1947 level in 1949 and at about two-
thirds in 1950. In 1948 and 1949, West Africa experienced an import level
from the dollar area of almost half the 1947 figure in value terms. 53 Put dif­
ferently, during the seven years between 1947 and 1953 the colonial group
exported on average 2.5 times as much in value terms to the dollar area as
it imported from the dollar area, and about four times as much in the years
1950 and 1951. In the years 1948 and 1949, West Africa exported about 3.5
times as much to the dollar area as it imported, and between 1951 and
1953 on average about five times as much. A peak was reached in 1950,
when the value of exports was more than six times the value of imports.Key Economic Relationships, 1947–58 43
For Malaya, the corresponding ratios were 2.8, 4.4 and 11. This suggests
that surpluses by the colonial group with the dollar area were importantly
attributable to decreases in, and the maintenance of, a low level of imports
rather than merely to increases in the value of exports.
As for trade with continental Western Europe, the colonial group’s bal­
ance was hugely in surplus for most of the years, and in balance in 1947.
Malaya was largely responsible for this surplus, whereas the West Indies
were mostly in deficit. 54 The year 1951 marked a sudden soaring in
imports, which almost doubled for East and West Africa together, making
up about 20 per cent of imports from all areas. This correlates with a huge
British surplus within the EPU. A similar episode occurred in the sterling
area’s payments relations with the rising economy of Japan in the early
1950s. Japan’s sterling balances had swollen to about six times their usual
level between August 1951 and August 1952. During this period, the
colonies, which imported sizeable amounts of textiles from Japan, saw
their level of Japanese imports reduced, and subsequently again increased,
when the Japanese balances had fallen unduly, notably related to wool
imports from Australia and New Zealand. 55
Colonial trade with Britain and the independent sterling area constitutes
the counterpart of colonial non-sterling relations. Over the period
1947–53, the value of exports by the colonial group to Britain made up
about one-third of its exports to all areas, and rather less than one-third in
1950. At the same time, the group’s imports also made up about one-third,
and rather more so in 1949. Considerable variations existed between differ­
ent colonial sub-groups. For West Africa the share of total exports was
about 60 per cent and the import share slightly less. For Malaya the export
share stood only at about one-seventh in most of the years and imports in
value terms stood at about one-fifth of total imports. 56 On the whole, the
period shows a slight trend towards increased import dependence by the
colonies on Britain.
The overall trade balance was positive or roughly balanced, but in
medium deficit in 1949. The colonial trade balance with Britain showed
persistent medium deficits for East Africa, and equally persistent medium
to high surpluses for West Africa. Malaya had slight to medium deficits,
except for 1950 and 1951 when it had a surplus. The West Indies show
mostly small deficits. Therefore, it was West Africa that was solely responsi­
ble for the positive, or only limited deficits, in the overall balance of this
colonial group.
Trade levels between the colonial group and the independent sterling
area remained fairly stagnant during the period 1947–53. The colonial
group’s share of exports was about slightly less than 10 per cent of exports
to all areas, and around 10 per cent for imports. The group, therefore,
incurred a small deficit vis-à-vis the independent sterling area. However,
East Africa was always slightly in surplus, whereas the other areas, West44
Money and the End of Empire
Africa, Malaya and the West Indies, were slightly in deficit most of the
time. No heavy fluctuations occurred with the exception of a notable sur­
plus of Malaya in 1951 and a corresponding deficit of Malaya in 1952.
3. Colonial capital relations
Colonial sterling balances accumulated by a different process, though in
principle as the result of the same underlying economic relations as those of
independent sterling area members. In the colonial context the trade bal­
ance is particularly important, since the peculiarities of colonial monetary
arrangements meant that foreign exchange earnings were automatically
related to the local money supply, which was fully covered by reserves, and
made up an important part of the sterling balances. Moreover, unlike those
of independent sterling area members, part of the colonial balances was
held in ways or for purposes that were specific to the colonies. It is impor­
tant, therefore, to consider how the balances were held and how they were
employed in the colonial case. 57
In quantitative terms, the overall colonial balances (excluding India)
increased from about £400 milion in 1945 to about £1400 million in the mid­
1950s (Figure 3.7). While in 1945 the colonial balances made up less than a
quarter of the total balances of the overseas sterling area, in the mid-1950s
they made up about one half. Compared to the total level of the overseas

sterling area, colonial balances showed a parallel movement. However, they
increased between 1947 and 1950, when Britain’s overall overseas balances
decreased. The increase in Australian sterling balances was even higher than
that of the colonies between 1947 and 1950. However, these balances fell in
the early 1950s, 58 whereas the colonial balances increased further. The oppo­
site movement occurred with respect to the sterling balances of India, which
decreased from their enormous wartime level, when they had made up about
two-thirds of the balances of the overseas sterling area, to an insignificant
level by the end of the 1950s. Marked variations among holders of balances
existed within the colonial group (Figure 3.8 and Table 3.5). The colonial ster­
ling balances were made up to a large extent by balances of Malaya, West
Africa and East Africa, in their order of importance. Within West Africa,
almost 60 per cent of the balances was attributable to Nigeria, and about 40
per cent to the Gold Coast. 59 By contrast, areas that played a much less signif­
icant role were the Rhodesias, 60 the West Indies and entrepôt centres (though
Hong Kong was of some importance).
The rate of accumulation of the specified colonial group increased by
about 100 per cent in the important period from December 1945 to June
1951. The increase in West African holdings was the most marked (more
than 200 per cent), followed by Malaya (96 per cent). Between June 1950
and June 1951 the increase was about 60 per cent. The most marked
increases occurred with respect to West Africa (83 per cent) and Malaya
(104 per cent). Unlike the Australian balances, the colonial sterling balances
continued to increase after 1951. Between June 1951 and the end of 1954,

a further increase by 48 per cent took place. Here, the West African increase
was the most striking (58 per cent). 61 Therefore, it was basically the balances
of the dependent sterling area and of Australia 62 that supported Britain’s
balance of payments in the period 1947–51, and subsequently the colonial
balances alone, until the rise of Middle Eastern oil balances from the mid­
1950s (Table 3.6). 63 By that time, however, this mattered less for Britain,
since her external economic relations were becoming redefined. 64Key Economic Relationships, 1947–58 47
In the entire period 1947–54, the increase in the sterling balances of the
specified colonial group amounted to about 105 per cent of the accumu­
lated increases of Britain’s total overseas sterling balances. In the heavy
deficit years of 1947 and 1951, colonial balances cushioned heavy with­
drawals, that is, without colonial increases withdrawals of sterling balances
would have been by about 4 per cent heavier in 1947–8, and 25 per cent
heavier in 1951–2. Increases in colonial balances made up 37 per cent of all
increases in the surplus year of 1948, 65 per cent in 1949, 30 per cent in
1950, 52 per cent in 1952, 28 per cent in 1953 and 133 per cent in 1954. 65
The regional distribution of the colonial sterling balances confirms the
importance of commodity exports for the accumulation of colonial bal­
ances, since the major holders of the balances were at the same time the
main colonial commodity exporters during the period in value terms. On
the whole, invisibles and capital inflows played a negligible role. Especially
in West Africa, the visible trade balance closely correlated with the accumu­
lation of the sterling balances. However, the role the colonies fulfilled
for Britain lay as much in their net contribution, notably via their dollar
surpluses, as in what they refrained from doing, namely not to draw on
accumulated balances, which were comparatively high already at the end
of the Second World War.
All colonial exchange earnings accumulated as sterling balances via the
colonial currency board mechanism, either in the currency funds, the mar­
keting board funds or the government funds. The proportion between these
funds was a matter of local producer price-fixing and taxation. The currency
‘earned’ via colonial export earnings was fully backed by reserves, which
accumulated in the currency board funds. This meant, in fact, that the total
currency in circulation could be presented for conversion at any one time
without the system defaulting, and, in theory, also constituted a barrier
against the withdrawal of balances. Balances in this fund could not simply
be withdrawn, they could only accumulate less, unless provisions were made
for special releases from these funds. Otherwise, a reduction would require
an overall trade deficit by the colonial group concerned in order to lead to a
reduction of colonial sterling balances as a whole. A reduction of sterling bal­
ances by the spending of other, quantitatively less important funds, was,
however, possible. But any notable decrease in colonial balances could not
occur, if the colonial currency board arrangements and policies towards mar­
keting boards and government reserve funds remained unchanged.
However, long-term capital flows from Britain to the colonies had the
potential to inflate colonial sterling balances. This is difficult to assess with
accuracy, particularly with regard to individual territories, but was almost
certainly a negligible factor. The widespread contemporary assumption that
these flows were considerable is a myth. They did not go to any noteworthy
extent to those colonies that accumulated a high level of the sterling
balances; they were very low in comparison with the amount of balances48
Money and the End of Empire
accumulated by commodity earnings. 66 (The situation might have been dif­
ferent in the case of Kenya.) Moreover, such inflows were usually earmarked
for specific purposes and tended to be spent in the short term on imports.
Accordingly, they did not inflate the balances permanently, since this
investment did not remain within the colonial economies.
A cursory assessment of capital flows to the colonies is required for the pre­
sent purpose because the matter affected policy debates on sterling area man­
agement, development finance and the sterling balances (Figures 3.9 and
3.10). The inflows to the colonies can be divided into British and foreign, and
public and private. Flows of public capital from Britain to the colonies via
grants and indirect investment via loans can be estimated relatively easily.

Loans for colonial governments from the London money market amounted
to an annual average of about £18 million in the period 1948–58.
Borrowing soared from £3 million in 1948 to about £30 million in 1952,
and then fell to an annual average of about £10 million from the mid­
1950s. A large part of these loans went to the Rhodesias and East Africa. 67
Grants from the British government to the colonies within the framework
of the Colonial Development and Welfare (CD&W) Acts amounted to an
allocated total of £173 million and an issued total of about £130 million
between 1947–8 and 1956–7. 68 Other grants amounted to a total of £181
million for the period 1947–55. 69 In addition, there were investments by
the Colonial Development Corporation (CDC), which had a ceiling of £100
million. The big unknown is the flow of direct private capital from Britain,
which was arguably the most important share of long-term colonial inflows.
However, estimates for overall capital flows to the colonies, Rhodesia, India,
South Africa and Australia, as a whole, show an absolute flow of some
£1650 million from Britain between 1946 and 1955. South Africa received
about 30 per cent of this total, all colonies together about 27 per cent,
Australia 21 per cent, Rhodesia 15 per cent and India 6 per cent. 70 This puts
the flows to the colonies in perspective and shows a radically different dis­
tribution from the sterling balances, where the colonies made up 54 per
cent and Rhodesia only 1 per cent of the group’s total.
Capital flows to the colonies from outside the sterling area by govern­
ments or international organizations and indirect investment have been
assessed by the Bank of England, and foreign private investment by the
Colonial Office. The quantity of both was negligible compared to flows
from Britain, but the pattern began to change towards the end of the
1950s. In 1958, Jamaica became the first British colony to raise a loan in
New York instead of London. As for public and indirect foreign investment,
this was insignificant by comparison, though it may well have been
increasing after 1953. 71 By contrast, there existed also notable capital out­
flows other than sterling balances from certain colonies, namely gold
flows. Between 1948 and 1952, colonial gold exports to Britain contributed
about £10 million annually to the colonial balance of payments. The single
most important colonial gold exporter was the Gold Coast. It fulfilled, on a
minor scale, the role South Africa and Australia played within the indepen­
dent sterling area. Therefore, in the case of West Africa an overall trade sur­
plus met with a high level of dollar surpluses, and capital exports to
Britain, while the region experienced a very limited degree of capital
imports. 72 Over the period 1948–53, accumulated capital flows to West
Africa (generously estimated) amounted to only about 14 per cent of its
sterling balances, roughly one quarter of the area’s accumulated dollar sur­
plus, and just outweighed the value of its gold exports. West Africa’s and
Malaya’s special position with regard to capital inflows is borne out within
the colonial context. Inflows for each of the two colonies during the period50
Money and the End of Empire
1945–55 can be estimated to have made up less than 10 per cent of a group
containing the main colonies (except Hong Kong). The Rhodesias took up
almost 40 per cent, East Africa about 30 per cent and the West Indies the
remainder.
4. Britain and colonial performance
Two sets of more specific issues also need to be touched upon here, so that
changes in the economic relationship between Britain and her empire can
be properly assessed. The first is related to the current balance of colonial
territories, and was particularly relevant between 1947 and 1953, when
maximizing exports, minimizing imports and accumulating sterling bal­
ances and foreign exchange earnings were Britain’s prime concerns. The
second set of issues is related to the capital side and gained prominence
after 1953, when the problems and feasibility of greater liberalization in
trade and payments became important considerations for Britain in view of
the medium-term aim of making sterling again a convertible currency. The
two areas are linked via the sterling balances because of the special features
of colonial monetary arrangements.
The development of world prices for commodities (Figure 3.11) influ­
enced the level of export receipts. Moreover, import prices influenced the
trade balance, which, in turn, had a bearing on the level of the colonial
sterling balances. The precise effects of these relationships in supporting

the accumulation of colonial sterling balances in real terms cannot be
assessed here. Only some general remarks will be made on commodity
prices, the role of restrictive colonial import policies, and export volumes
with special regard to Malaya and the Gold Coast. 73
Among the vital colonial commodities were natural rubber, cocoa and
tin. Cocoa and rubber were also the most important colonial dollar earners.
However, while in absolute terms rubber was a bigger dollar earner than
cocoa, in relative terms cocoa 74 was more important during the late 1940s
and early 1950s; thereafter, both converged. 75 Put crudely, during the
period the world price for cocoa increased from a very low level in 1946 to
a high level in 1948, then decreased again, and then slowly increased
beyond the 1948 level, before it boomed in 1954–5. 76 The pattern for rub­
ber was different. Natural rubber prices were low at the end of the 1940s,
soared at the beginning of the Korean War in 1950, but subsequently lev­
elled out, though they remained higher than in the late 1940s. 77 Wool,
which was important for the independent sterling area members Australia
and New Zealand, followed a similar but less marked pattern. 78
The simple export/import ratio for Malaya shows important increases in
1950 and 1951 and to a lesser extent in 1955, compared to the late 1940s.
This corresponds with the boom periods, which occurred in 1950 and par­
ticularly 1951 and, albeit less marked, in 1955–7. In the Gold Coast, how­
ever, the modest boom years of 1948 and 1950 show the highest ratios,
whereas the main boom year of the period, 1954, shows a reduced ratio.
The fact that import restrictions were more stringent in 1948 than in 1954
might be one contributory factor in this. But the question of the overall
effects of restrictions or restraint in preventing more marked increases in
imports during these booms is complicated. Obvious factors that would
need to be assessed in individual colonies include the actual availability of
sources of supply, the propensity to import, and development constraints,
such as limitations on manpower, that might have checked expenditure on
capital goods.
None the less, with regard to the dollar area, the evidence of import dis­
crimination and reorientation is clear-cut, as has been shown earlier. An
indication of the influence of restrictive measures on imports from the dol­
lar area by the colonies can also be obtained from the assessment by British
government departments of the efficacy of imposed dollar ceilings and
from policy exercises on dollar liberalization. This material suggests that,
without these restrictions, colonial dollar imports would have been consid­
erably higher in value terms, and were not even half the expected levels in
the late 1940s and early 1950s. 79
The counterpart to price is volume. If one examines the development of
export volumes in conjunction with price one obtains a measure of the
proportion by which volume and price were important for export earnings
and for the sterling balances. Changing patterns and territorial variations52
Money and the End of Empire
over the period can also be discerned. According to the Colonial Office’s
judgement, the volume of total colonial commodity exports increased by
about 25 per cent between 1948 and 1953. 80 Changes in export volumes of
the major commodities of the two territories (cocoa for the Gold Coast and
natural rubber for Malaya) provide a rough indication of periods in which
increases played a particular role. As for Gold Coast cocoa, compared to the
base in 1947–9, volume was about 25 per cent higher in 1950 and 1951,
when there was a moderate boom, and again in 1957, which was no boom
year. Substantial increases, however, occurred only after 1960. Volume also
played some minor role in the years 1953 and 1956, but was not important
during the boom of 1948 and in the marked boom years 1954–5. 81 As for
Malayan rubber, the export volume was markedly higher (by about 20 per
cent) only during the strong boom of 1950–1. 82 This might indicate that
rubber, unlike cocoa, required a demand pull to increase exports. On the
whole, it seems that increases in export volume contributed at the most to
export receipts by up to 20 per cent in exceptional cases; in most years and
most cases the figure was much less.
The specific issues that need to be addressed on the capital side obtain
their relevance from Britain’s declared intent to move towards the greater
liberalization in trade and from the government’s priority in the 1950s to
make sterling convertible. It is, therefore, important to know how colonial
funds were managed, how the colonial sterling balances that accumulated
in these funds were invested, and how trade liberalization affected the level
and way in which they were held; in other words, whether and how far
they were judged to be in ‘excess’ of expected requirements. 83
The colonial sterling balances accumulated in funds for specific purposes,
which, on the one hand, affected their liquidity, and on the other, affected
the likelihood of their withdrawal and the way ‘excess’ balances were
assessed. 84 The distribution of funds of the specified colonial group (Figure
3.12) shows that in 1949 about one-third of the group’s sterling balances was
held in currency funds and another third in government funds (of which
one-third were general reserve funds); the remainder accumulated by
roughly one-third in marketing board funds and two-thirds in UK bank
funds. By 1954, this picture had changed slightly. The share of currency funds
was somewhat reduced, whereas the government funds now made up about
45 per cent. Most notably, general government reserves had increased, and
now made up more than half of the government funds and about one quar­
ter of all holdings. 85 In West Africa, commodity reserve funds reduced the
share of currency fund holdings. In the Gold Coast more than one quarter of
all holdings accumulated in marketing board funds in 1949, 41 per cent in
the currency board funds and another quarter in government funds (12 per
cent in general government reserves). In the course of the 1950s, the Gold
Coast’s government fund holdings grew considerably, whereas the share of
the marketing board and currency funds decreased. 86 In Nigeria, marketingKey Economic Relationships, 1947–58 53

board funds were higher and banking funds significantly higher. 87 In Malaya
no marketing funds existed and the share of currency board funds was pro­
portionately higher. In 1949, half the balances accumulated in the currency
funds, 35 per cent in government funds (10 per cent in general government
reserves). By the mid-1950s, however, over one-third of all holdings of
Malaya, like the Gold Coast, were general government reserves. 88
The balances that accumulated in the various colonial funds were
invested in London and most of them were managed by the Crown Agents.
The Crown Agents followed an investment policy that was designed to pro­
vide the best possible yield, given the purpose of the respective fund, and
to ensure the required levels of liquidity in view of anticipated withdrawals
(cf. Figure 3.13). 89 Very crudely, almost three-quarters of the colonial funds
were invested in British government securities, and another 15 per cent in
securities of other colonies. As for the liquidity of colonial investments
with the Crown Agents, about one-third of total investments matured
within five years, and another quarter within 6–12 years. 90 In order to
improve the yield, some restructuring towards short-term investments had
been initiated during cheap money policies in the late 1940s. Moreover,
inter-colonial investment by the Crown Agents was important because it
supported the raising of colonial loans on the London money market to a
considerable extent by channelling money from the colonial funds into
new loan issues. Colonial funds thus invested made up about half of the
total of newly raised colonial loans. Inter-colonial investment showed54

regional differences: the share of Malayan holdings in colonial stock, for
example, was much higher than that of other territories. 91
The designated purposes of colonial funds prompted the calculation of
‘excess’ funds by British government departments (Figures 3.14 and 3.15),
which aimed to assess both the funds that could be withdrawn, notably for
development purposes, and the risk of withdrawals during a run on the
balances. ‘Excess’ balances for the Treasury and Bank of England were basi­
cally government general reserve holdings (which, by statute, had to
amount to a minimum of six months of a territory’s annual income) and
special government reserves earmarked for development. They excluded,
however, the bulk of currency funds, marketing board funds, banking
funds and government special reserves, namely those earmarked for sink­
ing funds and pension funds. 92 Following an assessment by the Bank of
England in 1957, about 47 per cent of the Gold Coast/Ghana’s balances, 53
per cent of Nigeria’s balances, 35 per cent of East Africa’s balances and
about half of Malaya’s balances were labelled ‘excess’ balances. 93 The limits
within which withdrawals could be met within the framework of the exist­
ing arrangements becomes clear if one compares the liquidity of colonial
investments with the percentage of estimated ‘excess’ balances. This posed
a potential problem. If one simply assumes for the sake of argument that
the overall liquidity distribution of 1953 grosso modo applied in 1957 and
for individual territories, the following picture emerges: about 89 per cent
of the investments of Malaya, Ghana and Nigeria would have fallen within
the 12-year liquidity margin, but only 66 per cent within the five-year mar­
gin. This presented a basic problem in the mid- and late 1950s, even if indi­
vidual investment portfolios showed certain differences in liquidity. 94Key Economic Relationships, 1947–58 55

Furthermore, it was politically significant that these three territories also
held the bulk of colonial ‘excess’ balances.
A completely different risk assessment of the ‘excess’ level of balances
originated from the Treasury in 1956, when officials compared the level
of colonial balances in individual territories, and particularly the level of56
Money and the End of Empire
government reserve holdings with each territory’s annual national income,
its annual import level and its annual level of government expenditure.
The result showed that in the Gold Coast the level of balances corre­
sponded to 100 per cent of the annual national income, to 230 per cent of
annual imports, and to 200 per cent of annual government expenditure.
Nigeria showed the respective percentages of 45, 230 and 200. 95
The counterpart to the assessment of ‘excess’ balances was colonial (dol­
lar) liberalization, which provided a check on withdrawals. Colonial trade
liberalization was not well advanced by the mid-1950s, but was seen as
inevitable in the long run. A judgement on its costs from 1955 suggests
that external and local constraining factors were minor temporary distor­
tions of the overall picture of dollar expenditure. The Colonial Office esti­
mated substantial increases under conditions of full dollar liberalization.
A considerable amount of dollar imports (notably consumer goods,
machinery, vehicles and chemicals) were forgone by the colonies, without
having been compensated in return by UK supplies. In particular, West
African dollar imports were expected to double under conditions of dollar
liberalization. West Africa was estimated to make up about one quarter of
total increases in dollar imports. 96
5. Conclusion
This analysis has placed key imperial financial relationships within the
context of Britain’s external economic relations. The important political
implications of these issues for Britain’s imperial link will be discussed as
the story unfolds.
The sterling area played a major role in easing Britain’s current account
imbalances and dollar shortage during the sterling crises in the years
1947–52. At the same time, Britain’s overseas sterling balances markedly
increased. During the 1950s, Britain liberalized her external economic
relations. In the late 1950s, the dollar problem vanished, sterling returned
to convertibility and Britain’s trade moved away from the sterling area
towards the highly industrialized countries.
The colonies, especially West Africa and Malaya, were the pillars of the
discriminatory sterling area. Colonial trade with the dollar area showed
huge surpluses and a marked reduction in the value of imports from the late
1940s down to the mid-1950s. The redirection of import flows was not off­
set by alternative sources of supply, notably in West Africa. However, sur­
pluses diminished and deficits occurred after 1955. The empire accumulated
huge sterling balances via such ‘unrequited’ exports. For sterling area settle­
ment, these balances offset a decline in India’s holdings and also compen­
sated for the volatility of the balances of the ‘old’ Commonwealth. Nigeria
and the Gold Coast (in the late 1940s and during 1954–5), and Malaya
(in 1950–1) were especially important. Commodity earnings sustained theKey Economic Relationships, 1947–58 57
accumulation of the balances. Colonial sterling balances were only slowly
reduced in the late 1950s, and well in ‘excess’ of required reserves – espe­
cially in West Africa and Malaya. They also constituted potential claims on
Britain’s resources. The distribution of the ensuing colonial investment in
different funds changed during the period under review. Currency board
funds remained important; but general government reserves increased
considerably in relation to other funds compared to 1947. However, the
liquidity structure of the colonial investment portfolio did not change
substantially. The bulk of investment was relatively liquid; but in relation to
government funds that ought to be easily realizable, the liquidity distribu­
tion became less favourable from the mid-1950s. British capital exports
went largely to East and Central Africa rather than to the major colonial
contributors to the sterling area’s dollar pool. The London money market
issued the bulk of loans in the early 1950s; but the level of loans was low in
the late 1940s and declined to a negligible level from the mid-1950s, Kenya
being the main recipient.
Imperial economic relationships had a significant political dimension.
The feasibility of using import restraint to support the sterling area
depended on political conditions and on the development needs of indi­
vidual territories. The holding of a high level of sterling balances hinged on
political control. After 1953, Britain’s aim to liberalize and make sterling
convertible was in conflict with the huge level of balances. Changed priori­
ties in external economic relations after 1958 also diminished the empire’s
role for Britain. What mattered under these conditions was less the
colonies’ performance on current account than their restraint on the capi­
tal side. A controlled reduction of the sterling balances depended on the
cooperation with, or the influence over, their holders. A high level of
expandable balances, together with a relaxation of import restrictions,
increased the risk of their withdrawal. The distribution of colonial invest­
ment in specific funds also had a political dimension because these funds
were supposed to fulfil specific purposes. Pressure was, therefore, high for
general government reserves to be used for economic development and
infrastructure. Marketing board funds were linked to the producers in
whose names they originally accumulated. If used for different purposes,
political problems were rife. The level of currency board holdings and of
the currency cover were politically delicate issues because they raised ques­
tions of economic and financial self-government. The shortage of loans
from the London market heightened political pressures on the periphery,
when desired withdrawals of balances were not available, and vice versa.
This highlighted the fact that the implicit quid pro quo of the sterling area –
the holding of sterling in exchange for capital from Britain – was not real­
ized in important colonies. The liquidity of colonial investment also
became a political issue in cases in which demands for the withdrawal of
balances reached an amount surpassing the liquid portion of the portfolio.58
Money and the End of Empire
Moreover, the Crown Agents’ practice of supporting the market for colonial
loans by inter-colonial investment depended on the availability of large
colonial investment and conflicted with the reduction of balances.
This chapter has outlined Britain’s key economic relationships with the
empire. The conclusions have suggested, moreover, that these relationships
had important political underpinnings and possible implications for
changes in Britain’s foreign relations. The remainder of the study illumi­
nates the politics of imperial economic relations and its repercussions on
Britain’s link with the empire.Part II

Britain’s requirements in external economic relations during the severe
sterling exchange crises from 1947 to 1952 prompted her to seek a close
association with the empire in discriminatory economic policies down to
about 1953. Britain’s emerging welfare state relied heavily on the empire to
reduce imbalances during sterling crises. International economic condi­
tions and diplomacy made the discriminatory management of the empire
both feasible and worthwhile. Imperial policy during the discriminatory
period can be understood as the (temporarily successful) attempt to pro­
mote the aspirations of the British polity in foreign economic relations.
The considerable research on this period has so far largely bypassed the
international relations perspective employed here, or emphasized more
specific aspects of the problem. 1
1. The discriminatory welfare state
The British welfare state emerged in the aftermath of the Second World War
and was designed in practical terms by the Labour governments between
1945 and 1951. 2 Welfare objectives required certain criteria to be met which
importantly depended upon the performance of the domestic economy as
well as on external economic relations. Therefore, welfarism had a potential
knock-on effect on imperial relations and blended with the traditional char­
acteristics of British external economic policies. 3
Britain exhibited peculiar features during the period. Labour set out to
enlarge the state’s influence in the British polity. The period 1945–51 is
exceptional in British peace-time history, being marked by a move away
from a relatively weak liberal state towards a strengthened state. 4 An
important novelty was a large-scale, state-led investment programme cov­
ering reconstruction which attempted to incorporate industrial lobbies.
Another was the nationalization programme for important sectors of the
economy. The most durable was the implementation of welfare provisions
devised during the war. Governments that followed had to live up to the
6162
Money and the End of Empire
expectations of a more open British society; welfare policies lowered the
level of austerity that voters were prepared to tolerate. 5
The advocacy of a strong state went along with specific ways in which
the domestic economy was run. ‘Cheap money’ policies were designed to
keep down the costs of nationalization. 6 High levels of domestic invest­
ment were to be achieved. However, unlike during the 1930s, the ensuing
inflationary pressures had to be offset without compromising full employ­
ment. This posed particular problems during periods of balance of pay­
ments crises and the shortage of dollars to pay for imports. 7 Still, the
extension and enlargement of state controls and planning cannot be attrib­
uted solely to the increasing size of an interventionist socialist-inspired
state. 8 Many measures, notably import controls, were due to a continua­
tion of wartime management, when the British economy was on the brink
of collapse. Such methods were used by the subsequent Conservative gov­
ernment in pursuit of similar short-term aims. Importantly, these measures
were more stringent in the colonies than in Britain. Other measures were
due to the fact that the nature of the state changed as a result of Keynesian
demand planning in the domestic economy. 9 Professional economists
acted increasingly as advisers to, or were themselves in, government. 10
The difference between the British state under Labour and under the
Conservatives rather lay in the long-term views and strategies regarding
Britain’s re-integration into the postwar international economy, that is, in
a multilateral or a bilateral economic order. Meanwhile, Britain’s key eco­
nomic institutions represented the long-term continuities of the polity.
Important parts of the Treasury and the Bank of England, as well as eco­
nomic policy advisers, remained committed to non-interventionist liberal­
ism at home and multilateralism in foreign economic relations and a
return to sterling convertibility. The influence of these institutional inter­
ests had been marginalized during the war but re-emerged thereafter. 11
The setting of the state, its management and defined interests, had direct
and indirect implications for Britain’s relationships with the empire. The
direct implications can be discerned in Britain’s colonial economic policy.
The indirect implications were felt in the way in which external economic
relations were managed, in which the empire occupied an important place.
British and colonial interests were seen as virtually indistinguishable.
Imperial policy was part of the ‘common cause’ linking Britain and the
imperial sterling area; colonial policy was subservient to the requirements
of Britain’s national economy. Britain’s policy towards the empire supple­
mented her external economic policies in important ways during a period
of huge colonial export earnings. While economic austerity in Britain
increased political risks for the government, austerity remained feasible in
the colonies. 12
For some factions in the Labour government the empire was part of the
discriminatory bilateral design of Britain’s envisaged position within thePostwar Economic Reconstruction 63
international economy – to a large measure in concealed opposition to the
multilateralism advocated by the United States. However, for other Labour
politicians and for powerful British institutions (and the Conservatives
after 1951) the empire had to match the interests of liberal multilateralism
in competition with the United States. 13 In any case, British economic pol­
icy had to achieve reconstruction jointly with welfare objectives, and the
empire needed to help Britain to get back on track in the long run towards
a situation which allowed sterling convertibility. This course was marred
with obstacles, arising from Britain’s external economic position. The prob­
lems were particularly grave during the sterling convertibility crises of
1947, the crisis of 1949, when sterling was devalued, and in 1951–2, and
were heightened by the constraints of the massive rearmament programme
in 1950. Thus, strategies that would ease Britain’s balance of payments and
reserve problems were nothing less than a matter of economic survival. 14
The empire proved to be even more important because of constraints that
emerged in Britain’s external economic relations elsewhere.
2. The economic diplomacy of discrimination
External economic diplomacy during the period affected Britain’s imperial
relations in important ways. The colonies were to a certain extent directly
implicated in the matters addressed by Britain in the negotiations on the
postwar international economic order and reconstruction. In addition, the
outcome of these negotiations had a bearing on Britain’s leverage in for­
eign economic relations, which in turn influenced policies towards the
empire. The most important constraints resulted from Britain’s relations
with the United States; others concerned the independent sterling area. 15
After the Second World War, the United States lobbied for the liberaliza­
tion of the world economy. This issue was the basis of the well-known dis­
cussions at Bretton Woods, the foundation of the World Bank (IBRD) and
the IMF, and also influenced the allocation of Marshall Aid for Europe. The
United States was the single major power whose economy survived the war
virtually unscathed. Britain’s recovery programme, therefore, needed to
draw upon the wealth of the United States. The Americans, in turn, pushed
the Labour government towards economic multilateralism. Under the
Conservative government after 1951 such lobbying became superfluous. By
that time, however, the Americans were pushing rather less forcefully, due
to domestic economic problems. The implementation of liberal multilater­
alism involved considerable debate on how to restructure economies, how
to balance payments and how to finance reconstruction. British and
American negotiators met on the following main occasions during the
period: the Anglo-American loan negotiations in 1945, the convertibility
crisis of 1947, the tripartite talks in Washington in 1949–50, and the ‘col­
lective approach’ on freer trade and currencies in 1953. These discussions64
Money and the End of Empire
covered the related issues of convertibility, the dollar shortage, and not
least the sterling balances. 16
Britain’s overseas sterling balances, which had increased considerably
during the war, had to be brought under control in order to make convert­
ibility feasible. The Anglo-American loan agreement of 1945, which con­
tained a convertibility clause, led to sterling area negotiations on the
reduction of the sterling balances in the long run and on the control of
releases in the short term. The level of colonial sterling balances (except
those of India) was not of prime concern. However, steps were envisaged in
1946 on how to reduce them. 17 At the same time, the loan agreement
called for Britain’s commitment to non-discrimination. This posed particu­
lar problems because it increased potential claims on British financial
resources in addition to those that running down the sterling balances
would bring. Furthermore, falling far short of expectations, the loans indi­
rectly also increased Britain’s quest for alternative supports for cushioning
balance of payments imbalances. This search, in turn, prompted policy ini­
tiatives towards the colonies.
Acute crises soon complicated Britain’s cautious attempts to create the
conditions for multilateralism. In August 1947, Britain had to resort to the
convertibility clause in the loan agreement and suspended convertibility.
The crisis triggered a crucial move in colonial economic policy towards
more stringent import controls, higher taxation and self-financing of
development. In the end, the colonies became the single most important
alternative by which the equilibrium between the sterling and dollar worlds
might be re-established. The policy of discrimination, required for such
management, actually contravened the loan agreement 18 and was imple­
mented only with the United States’ concurrence. 19 Moreover, Britain saw
this policy as a possible alternative or supplement to the Marshall Plan. 20
After 1947, it became even more important for Britain to associate the
United States with a massive material contribution in any attempt to intro­
duce convertibility and trade liberalization. However, the United States was
not willing to play this role to the required extent. Similar issues, therefore,
were raised repeatedly in the agenda of Britain’s external economic diplo­
macy towards North America. At the tripartite talks with the United States
and Canada in 1949–50, the main British concerns (even more so than in
1946) were the sterling balances of the independent sterling area and how
to bind the Americans to a possible funding operation. Convertibility was
now out of focus, as it was seen to be neither feasible nor (by some) desir­
able in the short term. Again, the colonial sterling balances were largely
ignored. The view put to Canada and the United States was that the colo­
nial balances were needed for specific purposes as they stood. 21 Moreover,
both Britain and the United States deemed these balances not to constitute
immediate claims on Britain’s resources and to be under control not least
for political reasons. 22 Continued discrimination by the colonies had byPostwar Economic Reconstruction 65
then become accepted as an intrinsic part of Britain’s endeavour to re­
establish an equilibrium between the sterling and dollar areas by dollar
substitution and dollar earning. 23
The colonial option was also hastened by problems Britain encountered
elsewhere in its external relations. After the convertibility crisis of 1947,
certain countries were reluctant to build up their balances. This concern
was relevant in the case of South America, since countries there had no
monetary agreements that would provide for a settlement of surpluses in
gold. 24 Other countries already held considerable balances that they
desired to draw down, thus increasing the pressure on Britain’s resources.
Such action, therefore, had to be restricted by means of bilateral agree­
ments. A case in point was Egypt. Different categories of sterling were
established in order to keep claims on Britain provoked by these exchange
propensities in check. 25 India was the country where controlling the bal­
ances was most urgently needed. The British attempted to bring the ‘old’
Commonwealth in line with their requirements and were temporarily suc­
cessful, notably with respect to Australia. Moreover, ways were sought to
check India’s and Pakistan’s dollar expenditures. 26 Eventually, the huge
Indian sterling balances were brought under control through their gradual
reduction in the Colombo development plan. 27 However, hopes of closer
policy coordination with the independent Commonwealth gradually faded
in the early 1950s. While the Commonwealth Economic Conference in
1951 agreed to coordinate policy towards convertibility, 28 it failed to pro­
vide a definitive agreement on trade policy. 29
3. The imperial policy of discrimination
Britain’s economic policies towards the empire are explicable in terms of
the broader framework of her external economic policies. Prompted by ide­
ological inclination or lack of alternatives, Britain aimed at employing the
sterling area, and especially its imperial part, as a discriminatory entity in
order to boost Britain’s economic recovery. In the late 1940s, a coordinated
British policy was launched to manage the shortage of supplies through
‘unrequited’ exports and the building up of sterling balances. This strategy
aimed at enabling Britain to sustain an export drive and a high level of
domestic investment to boost production, while at the same time reducing
claims on its resources. 30 Such a policy required dollar pooling within the
sterling area. At the same time it was necessary to impose checks on ster­
ling outflows from the area, 31 as was the case regarding Belgium in particu-
lar. 32 Britain’s balance of payments policy in the long term aimed at a
strong increase in exports, and a considerable diversion of imports. 33
Devaluation in 1949 aimed at supporting this diversion exercise. 34
A close link existed between the planning of Britain’s economic
development and sterling area and colonial economic development. 3566
Money and the End of Empire
Administrative changes aimed at facilitating the coordination among
government departments on the crucial balance of payments question.
Interdepartmental committees covered the empire too. Important new
bodies were set up, such as the Overseas Negotiations Committee, for nego­
tiations with overseas countries on supplies, the Import Programmes
Committee for controlling the level of expenditure on imports, and the
Export Targets Committee. These were coordinated by the Central
Economic Planning Staff and ultimately supervised by the Economic
Steering Committee. 36
Parallel to the general policies on the management of ‘unrequited’
exports, were policies that concerned domestic and overseas investment in
relation to supporting Britain’s recovery. Policy often had to choose between
boosting home production (and conquering export markets) on the one
hand, and supporting sterling as an international trading currency and
London as an international centre of finance on the other. While domestic
investment was generally furthered during the period, attempts were made
to channel British overseas investment towards areas that were short of ster­
ling. Europe, South America and Canada were cases in point. Alternatively,
investment was boosted in development projects that were likely to have a
bearing on the performance of the sterling area within the international
economy rather than on the export performance of British industries.
Finance for sterling area development followed such priorities. However,
demands on the London money market had to be restrained in territories
that were of only limited value to the sterling area, and the promising
regions ultimately ought to meet the cost of their own development. 37
Britain’s economic policy towards the empire can best be surveyed
within the context of the series of financial crises she experienced between
1947 and 1953. During this period, British policy used the imperial sterling
area to rectify Britain’s and the sterling area’s external imbalances. Policies
encompassed trade discrimination via import licensing, the management
of ‘unrequited’ exports and colonial economic development to boost sub­
stitute supplies. The sterling crisis of 1947 marked the beginning of deter­
mined policy efforts in these areas. By the early 1950s, however, such
policies, for a variety of reasons, were approaching their limits, whereas
Britain’s crises persisted.
Import controls had been executed in an ad hoc manner during the
Second World War. Thereafter, modest and gradual measures of decontrol
were envisaged, and some trade was liberalized in 1945 and 1946, following
the move towards multilateralism conceded to the United States. The mea­
sures considered to reduce the sterling balances included cancellation (as
suggested by the United States), interest-free loans to Britain, a reduction of
the full currency cover in the colonies and even devaluation. 38 Yet 1947
marked the conscious move towards centralized control beyond anything
experienced during the war when a major crisis loomed, 39 and measuresPostwar Economic Reconstruction 67
were considerably tightened after the convertibility crisis in August of that
year. A complete suspension of import licences was imposed. The colonies
were openly instructed (on Treasury initiative) to discriminate against all
sources of supply, including Britain. 40 This radical overall discrimination
was lifted only in mid-1948, when the colonies were allowed to resume
imports from Britain and the Dominions. 41 This happened after consider­
able wrangling over the issue between the Treasury and the Board of Trade,
which had to deal with protests by British exporters. 42 Measures of quite
such crude rigidity were not openly advocated again during the recurrent
crises thereafter. However, the mechanisms that were instituted followed
similar principles throughout the period.
Colonial import policy followed a twofold approach: overall import con­
trol limited imports to ‘essentials’, and discriminatory trade arrangement
were intended to maximize the pooling of ‘hard’ currency. In principle,
import licences were issued irrespective of an individual territory’s export
performance. Goods other than those categorized as ‘essentials’ were to be
obtained, if needed, from sterling sources. Only as a last resort could alter­
natives from the dollar area or from countries outside the sterling and dol­
lar areas be obtained. It was, therefore, crucial to monitor import markets
that would directly or indirectly cost gold or dollars.
Colonial import licensing was effectively defined by dollar ceilings pro­
grammed by British government departments and applied by colonial
governments. 43 Temporary import stops from the dollar area (‘dollar stand­
still’) occurred repeatedly during the period. This happened in 1947 and in
relation to the dollar drain before the devaluation of 1949, when dollar
imports into the colonies were suspended from August to the end of the
year. 44 Severe restraint, short of total suspension, was exercised during the
dollar drain of 1951–2, too. 45 Suspension orders for imports from non­
dollar non-sterling sources were issued at various times to meet contingen­
cies of ‘hard’ currency leaks. In 1948, colonial imports from Belgium were
suspended. 46 Likewise, in late 1951, a problem developed with Belgian sur­
pluses within the European Payments Union (EPU), which again called for
restraint with respect to imports from Belgium. 47 On the other hand, the
colonies were urged to step up their imports from the EPU in the Spring of
1951, when Britain had a surplus with the EPU. 48 Similarly, in 1953, Britain
encouraged Japanese imports into the colonies, when Japan had a heavy
trade deficit with the sterling area and threatened retaliation. 49
Import planning by means of colonial dollar ceilings started in a crude
way after the convertibility crisis, when the first big cuts were made in
1947–8. Measures were repeatedly refined 50 and also used under the Con­
servative governments until the mid-1950s. Sterling crises prompted a recur­
rence of reinvigorated austerity in the colonies. Ceilings aimed at keeping
colonial dollar expenditures at the lowest possible level by making the
colonies ‘dollar-conscious’. 51 The arguments about the 1951 dollar drain68
Money and the End of Empire
and the continued dollar restrictions for the colonies were reminiscent
of the late 1940s. 52 In 1952, the Programmes Committee continued to
appreciate the importance of the colonial role in pooling dollars, and ceil­
ing arrangements were executed as in earlier years. 53
Dollar ceilings were supposed to be progressively lowered as more sup­
plies from Britain became available. 54 But the increasingly tight ceilings
were also difficult to maintain because a shortage of supplies heightened
inflationary pressures. 55 Moreover, in late 1952, further cuts were hard to
achieve, while the pressure for liberalization mounted to replace supplies
that were still not satisfactorily provided from sterling sources. Therefore,
the emphasis of policy shifted towards promoting the marketing of British
goods for the colonies. 56
The policy of import restrictions posed a dilemma not only with respect
to sources of supply, but also with regard to the kind of supplies that were
required or expedient. 57 The import category of ‘essentials’ was largely
defined by political expedience. Occasionally, consumer goods were admit­
ted, as they were seen to be necessary incentives in certain territories at cer­
tain times. Supplies of capital goods posed an intricate problem because
they were needed to meet the development objectives of colonial govern­
ments. Moreover, the fact that sterling sources were a general priority
raised the problem of the availability of supplies for the colonies in relation
to Britain’s own export drive towards non-sterling markets.
Steel, tin-plate and machinery presented the main recurrent problems in
planning dollar expenditure. At the beginning of the 1950s these difficul­
ties were compounded by the fact that supplies from the United States
were not available because of export restrictions in relation to rearmament.
However, Britain’s concerns with her dollar position in the early 1950s con­
tinued to be the main reason for limitations in steel imports. Allocations
were cut even when they were available. 58 As for machinery, intensive mar­
keting initiatives were taken to obtain more supplies from British sources.
Cotton textiles were the single most important colonial ‘incentive’ good.
After the rigorous reduction of textile supplies in the late 1940s, 59 some­
what greater attention was given, for political reasons, to the supply of tex­
tiles to the colonies. 60 The sources of imports were first defined by their
dollar component, and second by price differentials. American textiles were
generally the cheapest, but had to be limited. Japan was traditionally a
major supplier of colonial textiles, but her textiles were charged in dollars.
However, by 1950 Japanese textiles had become available for sterling. 61 This
meant that Lancashire supplies, which had made inroads into colonial mar­
kets after the sterling devaluation of 1949, were left on the sidelines, since
Japanese sources were cheaper. Moreover, payments relations with Japan for
a brief period made an increase of textile imports from Japan a priority. 62
The counterpart to restricting colonial imports from ‘hard’ currency
sources was directing colonial exports towards dollar markets. SuchPostwar Economic Reconstruction 69
measures were closely bound up with policies for developing colonial
resources. The problem was to identify ways in which the highest dollar
earning could be achieved. Commodities were selected in relation to assess­
ments of requirements of the United States in particular. Even before the
acute crisis of August 1947, the Colonial Primary Products Committee was
informed about US minerals and vegetable and animal products require-
ments. 63 From 1948, export targets were monitored via the Colonial
Development Committee in order to promote the so-called ‘colonial export
drive’. On the other hand, concerns existed about the saturation of mar-
kets. 64 Therefore, and because of the fear of a recession in the United
States, exports that saved dollars were preferred over those that earned dol­
lars. Such a strategy, it was hoped, would secure markets and guarantee
prices that were competitive on the world market. 65
The commodities singled out as priorities included foodstuffs (except
bananas), namely sugar, cocoa and rice; and raw materials, notably cotton,
hardwood, tin and copper. Targets were set in order to boost exports of
colonial commodities. Rubber was judged to be of great importance; but its
future was uncertain because of the impact of the synthetic rubber industry
in the United States. The success of rubber exports, therefore, depended
on price. On the other hand, the Treasury feared an overproduction of tin
by 1952. 66 Moreover, the Ministry of Food, concerned with the national
diet, thought that larger supplies from the colonies would enable an
increase in Britain’s fats ration by the early 1950s and the maintenance of
the sugar ration, while at the same time saving dollars. However, the exten­
sion of the capacity of dollar earning by expanding food production was
seen to be limited, except with respect to the already substantial exports of
cocoa. 67 Finally, albeit with limited success, initiatives were taken to make
gold production more efficient, since gold was immediately convertible
into dollars. 68
Policies towards the colonies became closely coordinated at the highest
level of government and determined the kind of development that was
promoted. Projects ranged from groundnuts in Tanganyika, to harbour
expansion schemes in Kenya, cotton in East Africa and even eggs in the
Gambia. 69 The Overseas Resources Development Act, which established
the Colonial Development Corporation, was passed in February 1948. 70
Devaluation prompted renewed initiatives aimed at enhancing production,
and also changed the importance of certain commodities for dollar saving.
Cotton production, mainly of the American type, was stepped up. 71
The production of established commodities markedly increased after the
Second World War. However, most schemes that developed additional
commodities failed, not least because competitive prices could not be
achieved. In the early 1950s, the Conservative government rejected the
ways these schemes were operated by the state. But the Conservatives
maintained the role of colonial development as a contributor to Britain’s70
Money and the End of Empire
recovery. As Britain’s crises persisted, efforts to enhance colonial produc­
tion continued to be made. The Commonwealth Economic Conference of
1951, which was supposed to usher in the Conservative government’s
return to liberal policy principles, reaffirmed discriminatory colonial poli­
cies to support the sterling area. Colonial production by that time was
about 75 per cent above the 1946 level, and about one-third above the pre­
war level, and was expected to have potential for further expansion. 72 The
streamlining of schemes via privatization and a greater selectivity on pro­
jects for sterling area purposes was expected to bring success. The policy
was no longer centralized and integrated with government priorities as had
been the case under Labour, but rather became a supplementary strategy. 73
Moreover, there was now increasing concern, notably in the Colonial
Office, that Britain’s methods in developing the imperial sterling area
would encourage colonial nationalism.
Colonial development in the long run heightened needs for capital goods
and for finance to sustain it and thus detracted from import restraint and
financial austerity. The main prerequisites of development, notably in Africa,
were improved communications, which required steel and iron. 74 This was
seen to be the major problem during the period, 75 whereas finance was not
considered an important constraint in the late 1940s. 76 The policy on devel­
opment finance emphasized that the colonies should meet their develop­
ment requirements from their own funds, having recourse to finance from
the Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) and Colonial Development
and Welfare (CD&W) only as a supplement. Exceptions could possibly be
made for the construction of railways. 77 Moreover, the Treasury had given
no assurances for colonial borrowing from the London money market. 78 The
Colonial Secretary informed the colonies that all efforts had to be directed
towards remedying the balance of payments of the sterling area. Borrowing
in London could be only the last resort. 79
At the beginning of the 1950s, Britain was continuing to finance the
majority of colonial development needs from local sources. 80 However,
financial requirements were increasing, and in 1952 the Colonial Office
went back on its earlier assumption that finance was not the most impor­
tant obstacle in promoting colonial development. 81 British policy, therefore,
became wary of controlling capital flows towards the colonies. Colonial
development was welcome as long as it was largely self-financed, or as long
as it was expected to make an important contribution to the running of the
sterling area. But, by 1953, it had become clear that demands on the
London money market would ultimately become considerably higher than
had been anticipated. Such demands, and the problems of meeting them,
prompted a great debate on development finance to be opened.
Entwined with trade and development policies was a separate policy,
albeit less clear-cut and coherent, regarding the colonial sterling balances.
At the end of the Second World War, British government departments hadPostwar Economic Reconstruction 71
envisaged a gradual and controlled reduction of colonial ‘excess’ sterling
balances accumulated during the war. These balances might be released via
the creation of a fiduciary issue of colonial currencies and contribute to
colonial development finance, thus substituting some other development
allocations from Britain. ‘Free’ balances were to be controlled by import
licensing. 82 But as early as the beginning of 1947, the Bank called for the
improved control of the colonial sterling balances, 83 and the convertibility
crisis brought a complete turnaround. It became explicit policy to build up
the colonial sterling balances, and to prevent their withdrawal. 84 By 1953,
however, the Bank of England and the Treasury (unlike the Colonial Office)
had become wary of such a course. 85 Hitherto, policy exercises on the feasi­
bility of convertibility had assumed that they could safely ignore the depen­
dent sterling area. After 1953, this was no longer the case. Moreover, the
policy of accumulating sterling balances became challenged as the share of
self-financing by the colonies in their own development was decreasing.
When multilateralists in British government departments and the Bank
regained the upper hand after the Conservative victory in 1951, lobbying
for the convertibility of sterling emerged more forcefully. The abortive
ROBOT plan was followed by the equally unsuccessful attempt to associate
the United States with a convertibility operation via the so-called ‘collec­
tive approach’ in March 1953. 86 By this time, doubt was being cast on the
colonial option, when colonial balances soared and their control, it was
feared, might get out of hand. The Bank and Treasury recognized that the
colonial balances constituted claims on British resources that had to be
reckoned with. 87 Moreover, the Bank of England by that time also had
begun to realize that, in the long run, convertibility would not be possible
while maintaining a high degree of trade discrimination. Therefore, the
consequences of the liberalization of imports had to be considered in the
convertibility discussions. 88
4. The rationale of the co-option of empire
The underlying rationale of British policy can be detected in the problems
of running Britain’s economy during a period of grave balance of payments
and reserve problems. The colonial portion of the sterling area was capable
of easing the dollar shortage by its commodity exports to the dollar area.
From the British perspective, the colonies were important contributors to
solving the global liquidity problem via the management of ‘unrequited’
exports in the trade triangle of Britain, the imperial sterling area and the
dollar area. They helped to re-establish the equilibrium in international
trade at a time when, as the British plainly put it, they could ‘not yet
afford ... to repay [their] old debts’. 89
Keeping up colonial sterling balances was a means of preventing infla­
tionary pressures, which were a key concern of Britain’s domestic economic72
Money and the End of Empire
policy due to the low level of production, the dollar shortage and ‘cheap
money’ policies. Colonial balances, therefore, had to be kept out of circula­
tion, whether by physical import controls, taxation, or both. Import restric­
tions aimed at enhancing or maintaining the colonial dollar earning
capacity. But this strategy bore the risk that the British market would eventu­
ally be swamped with sterling for which it could provide no goods. Inflation
was not a problem of Britain or of important individual colonies alone: it
was a problem of the entity of Britain and the sterling area. Checking colo­
nial sterling balances was required due to the state of Britain’s domestic
economy and also important for guaranteeing the viability of the empire for
Britain during a period of expansion in colonial economies.
By contrast, in the case of a recession in the world economy, particularly
in the United States, a different situation might arise. Under such condi­
tions, spending overseas sterling balances on British exports might help the
British economy and check unemployment in Britain. 90 This was the
British policy design towards the colonies; elsewhere this option was not
advisable, since most independent sterling holders were either short of ster­
ling or their withdrawals might easily get out of control. 91 Still, the pound
sterling and its future were the dominant concerns of British policy rather
than the management of Britain’s industrial exports. 92 This is borne out by
policies regarding the sterling balances, as well as the general debate on the
direction of British overseas capital flows, 93 and is also confirmed by such
incidents as the brief discrimination against British exports in 1947 and the
colonial trade management towards Europe and Japan.
None the less, by 1953 the planning of ‘unrequited’ exports had been
abandoned. The reason was not so much that the Conservative govern­
ment acted on liberal presumptions of external economic policy, but rather
that such trade-cum-financial management of the colonies had reached its
limits for a variety of reasons, which indeed had been foreseen at the pol-
icy’s inception. 94 The Treasury’s Economic Section had known all along
that managing Britain’s balance of payments and reserve crises by ‘unre­
quited’ exports was a method that would only work for a time and also car­
ried risks. Imports could not be diverted indefinitely, and political pressure
for drawing down the sterling balances would increase. On the other hand,
in the early 1950s the dollar shortage was not yet solved, and rearmament
became a heavy burden. On top of that, a global recession was bound to
make a redirection of exports towards dollar markets more difficult. For
these reasons, new policy directions on sterling were called for in 1952. 95
However, in 1948 politicians worried little about the long-term impractica­
bility of their policies, when they were pressed to find ways that would
steer Britain’s economy through the next few years.
Britain’s external economic crises were treated by a variety of doctrines,
some of which had Keynesian undertones. Others were totally opposed to
Keynes’s own views as policy adviser before his death in 1946. KeynesianPostwar Economic Reconstruction 73
management of Britain’s domestic economy is credited to have taken
over from planning as early as 1947, and in budgetary matters even
earlier. 96 But external economic policy, with its emphasis on ‘unrequited’
exports, in 1947 took a course which Keynes had cautioned against as a
policy in peace-time. 97 However, in the colonies Britain relied heavily on
taxation in order to supplement import controls. Taxation increasingly
inflated government reserves, which needed to be frozen in order not to
prompt colonial inflation or reduce the sterling balances. This strategy, too,
was bound to have its limits.
5. The institutional dimension
This overall rationale notwithstanding, imperial policy was by no means in
every respect the result of planned, coherent and deliberate action. Policy
was formulated by interdepartmental committees, which involved leading
Cabinet ministers as well as high-ranking civil servants and officials from
the Bank of England. The participants had different degrees of understand­
ing of the general issues. Important technicalities were obvious only to a
limited number of those involved. Theoretical exercises were rare and insuf­
ficiently influential even within circles of technocrats. What mattered dur­
ing crises was that policy produced an immediate result. Therefore, many
problems that policies provoked in the long run were not anticipated.
Under Labour, politicians such as Cripps, Dalton, Creech Jones and
Bevin boasted enthusiastically about colonial development and the expan­
sion of the production of colonial commodities. 98 This option would not
only support the sterling area’s balance of payments, but in the long term
even boost Britain’s performance in a protectionist world economy. Civil
servants were usually more pragmatic and less concerned with grandiose
schemes. However, they expressed the interests and orthodoxies of the
administration for which they worked. The rather technical nature of
imperial economic relations guaranteed them considerable influence in the
shaping of policy that outlasted ideological changes in government.
Among the crucial government departments involved, the Colonial
Office lacked a perspective on the issues that concerned Britain’s macroeco­
nomic management. None the less, the officials there advocated rural
economic development in the colonies and defended ‘sound’, that is,
restrictive, financial management and monetary policy. Importantly, the
Colonial Office held that the colonies, in order to prosper, first needed to
restore prosperity in Britain. The Colonial Office saw this ‘common cause’
and the ‘contribution’ the colonies could make to Britain’s economic
recovery with considerable pride, especially in the late 1940s. The colonies
should ‘help’ Britain by stepping up their dollar earning 99 and contribute
to improving the sterling area’s balance of payments. The interests of the
colonies and of Britain were seen to be identical. 100 Colonial production74
Money and the End of Empire
could assist in ‘the rehabilitation of a world ravaged by war, in the restora­
tion of economic stability in the United Kingdom, and in the development
of the Colonies themselves’. 101 As late as 1952, the Colonial Secretary
said he knew that the colonial contribution would be ‘gladly sustained
until [Britain’s] goal [was] achieved’. 102 Only in 1953 did references to
the continuation of established austerity policies become slightly more
defensive. 103
Policy-makers in the Colonial Office usually followed the Bank of
England’s advice. However, it seems that they did not always understand
the arguments advanced by the Bank and the Treasury. For example, the
Colonial Office refused to accept that the colonial sterling balances accu­
mulated for anything other than required purposes, and, therefore, also
rejected that they were ultimately claims on Britain. This position even led
to the misrepresentation of facts in sterling area meetings. In 1953, a high-
ranking official declared before the Commonwealth Liaison Committee
that the accumulation of colonial sterling balances was due merely to
increases in currency holdings and pension funds. 104
By contrast, the Treasury and particularly the Bank of England were rep­
resentative of the broader design of external economic policy in which the
empire had to play its role. Whether this was ultimately to lead to a multi­
lateral or a bilateral world was not of prime importance during the crisis
years of 1947–51. These institutions showed, of course, much greater
insight into how the general policy was supposed to work at the macro
level, about its purpose and its temporary nature. However, the Treasury
and Bank ignored particular problems of colonial economic arrangements
as long as they did not forcefully impose themselves upon policy-makers.
The Colonial Office’s stance corresponded well to the exigencies of the
day, as defined by the Treasury and the Bank of England. The colonies were
busy meeting the vicissitudes of a metropolitan policy to protect sterling
which Britain’s balance of payments contingencies imposed on them. This
sometimes led to curious episodes, when colonial import policies responded
to British needs that had already changed to the opposite, as was the case
with Europe and Japan in the early 1950s. 105 The colonies also played their
part in Anglo-American diplomacy. In 1949, the British extended the com­
plete suspension of colonial dollar imports and earlier deflated figures on
colonial dollar earning transmitted to OEEC, in order not to compromise
American allocations for the European Recovery Programme. 106
Significantly, all government departments were conscious of the success
of the colonial contribution to the sterling area’s balance of payments and
appreciated that it constituted a valid alternative to the independent ster­
ling area. 107 In 1951, the British were satisfied that the 1951 dollar ceiling
was at one-third that of 1948. This was much lower than for the indepen­
dent Commonwealth, which had agreed to keep within a 75 per cent mar­
gin of the 1948 expenditure, but only exceptionally did so. By the earlyPostwar Economic Reconstruction 75
1950s, these countries had considerably liberalized their imports from the
dollar area. 108
The management of ‘unrequited’ exports was readily adopted during the
late 1940s by the Bank and the Treasury because of the dependent status of
colonial territories and their unquestioned allegiance to the British cause.
Policy-makers assumed that the colonial sterling balances were under
control because of the restrictive import policy on the one hand, and the
structure of colonial monetary arrangements on the other. 109 British policy
assumed that colonies either could not draw on their balances because of the
peculiarities of their monetary arrangements, or that they would not draw
on them because they could be persuaded to exercise restraint. The colonies
‘made a good contribution’, and more formal measures of control could be
introduced if required. Colonial governments were seen as being cooperative
in building up sterling balances. 110 And, as the Colonial Secretary put it,
‘even from the psychological angle colonial sterling balances [were] less dis­
turbing than the majority of other sterling balances’. 111
6. Conclusion
This chapter has provided evidence for the connection between Britain’s
external economic and imperial policies. From 1947 to 1953, Britain relied
heavily on colonial balance of payments surpluses during sterling crises.
British imperial policy was entwined with the traditional financial priori­
ties of the British state, as well as with novel objectives of welfarism.
Colonial policies in the areas of the balance of payments, finance and
inflation were attuned to Britain’s needs and measured against Britain’s
economic performance. Colonial trade management and the control of
‘hard’ currency expenditure were means to improve the British and the
sterling area’s balance of payments and reserve position. The development
drive in the colonies was designed to enhance the export performance of
those areas that were able to contribute most within the sterling area
framework. Anti-inflationary policies were designed at the intra-sterling
area level in order to enable Britain’s national economy to sustain a high
level of domestic investment, while at the same time boosting colonial per­
formance. The belief that the colonies’ behaviour could be attuned to
British needs was an integral part of the rationale of British policy.
Colonial development and import restriction was for some, such as the
Labour Left, a means of re-establishing Britain’s economic viability in a
protectionist world. For others, such as influential elements in the Treasury
and the Bank of England, the policy of dollar saving and earning was a
temporary discriminatory respite. Discrimination ought to enable Britain
to regain a trade equilibrium with the dollar area during postwar recon­
struction, make possible the convertibility of sterling and, ultimately, guar­
antee her a prominent role in a multilateral world. Intentions of creating a76
Money and the End of Empire
bilateral trading world vanished, when the Conservatives came to power in
1951. The dominant sections of the British polity were in favour of a cau­
tious long-term move towards convertibility at an even earlier date.
In the early 1950s, periodic convertibility exercises became an important
part of policy debates. However, these debates about economic liberalization
hardly affected the colonies, where policies of discrimination were still feasi­
ble and operational. The colonies thus became a discriminatory relic in an
increasingly liberal design of external economic policy. In 1953, however,
the perception of British policy-makers of the empire as an unproblematic
refuge of discriminatory policies was to change. Britain’s established policy
towards the colonies was seen to contradict her novel course in foreign eco­
nomic policy. 112
This chapter has focused on a discussion of British policy, its impulses
and rationale. In order to obtain a more complete picture, the argument
needs to consider the dependent status of the colonies and their specific
place in the international economy. These factors constituted constraints
and opportunities for Britain’s discriminatory management, as we shall see.
Appendix
Note
The appendices to chapters 4 to 9 illustrate the bases on which the main policy deci­
sions were taken by providing either summaries of data that resulted from large-scale
policy exercises, or specific data from documents that were crucial for policy deci­
sions. However, these tables give extracts only from a vast amount of statistical data
that are included in official policy assessments and only from those that are easily
quantifiable. This material, therefore, by no means represents an exhaustive account
of available data; nor is it sufficient to explain policy.
The bulk of the available statistical material has been used in chapter 3 in explain­
ing the basic economic interrelations between Britain and the empire. Unlike
chapter 3, the appendices aim at indicating only the subjective basis of specific poli­
cies. Tables will not repeat data given in chapter 3, unless they add detail that is of
interest from the policy perspective. Moreover, data that appear unnecessarily
detailed to be relevant to the present study will not be cited. In these cases the com­
mentary on the tables will include cross-references and note the availability of addi­
tional material.
The material given in the appendices has not been published before, except for
the figures in Table A.4.1 (used by Schenk, Britain and the Sterling Area, and in aggre­
gate form by numerous contemporary studies of the sterling area) and Table A.9.2
(contained in Morgan, Official History, vol. 3., p. 176).
Table A.4.1 gives an extract of monthly figures of the sterling balances of the sterling
area in the late 1940s and early 1950s at key dates, namely the end of the war, the
convertibility crisis (August 1947), the devaluation of sterling (September 1949), the
beginning of the Korean War (July 1950) and the end of the Labour government
(September 1951).Postwar Economic Reconstruction 77

The purpose of collecting these data was to keep track of the performance of a
policy that aimed at accumulating sterling balances, notably within the colonial
framework, and to provide a risk assessment of some independent countries. With
regard to the colonies, the assessment remained at the level of general geographical
aggregates. Moreover, the assessment gives only overall accumulated figures of bal­
ances and does not distinguish between different types of fund. Such distinctions
were made on a sporadic rather than a systematic basis. In 1953, the Working Party
on Colonial Sterling Balances systematically investigated overall aggregates of funds.
The general movements of the balances have been recognized by near-contemporary
research, which, however, had no access to monthly figures.
It is noteworthy that the bulk of the balances of India/Pakistan, Ceylon, Iraq and
Burma (as well as of Egypt, which held substantial balances but was excluded from
the sterling area in 1947) were blocked, subject to bilateral agreements. On the
whole, balances of independent countries were volatile in their upward and down­
ward movements, whereas the colonies were consistent in their upward trend.
Australia shows a dramatic upward trend, but by October 1951 the level of its bal­
ances had already decreased by one-third compared to the peak in June 1951. Indian
balances show a downward trend. New Zealand, South African, Rhodesian and Hong
Kong balances were not substantial. South Africa was, however, crucial for the ster­
ling area due to its gold sales. Malayan balances showed a sudden upward trend
from late 1950. West African balances increased importantly during 1948–9 andPostwar Economic Reconstruction 79

then again in late 1950. Balances of the Irish Republic were high but stable and even
showed a slight decrease between the end of 1945 and 1951.
Table A.4.2 shows monthly figures of colonial dollar surpluses with the United
States, and those of the crucial colonial dollar earners, Malaya and West Africa.
By mid-1948, the policy of boosting colonial dollar earning and, even more
importantly, dollar saving had become systematically organized in British govern­
ment departments. The assessment of colonial dollar earning and saving, and the80

establishment of dollar ceilings, constitute the bulk of the quantitative exercises
undertaken by government departments concerned with economic matters during
the period. The detailed collection of figures on these issues for different territories
and commodities is vast and has not been fully explored by recent research.
The monthly figures in the table reflect seasonal changes. However, the figures
show the importance of West Africa and Malaya in the colonial total and also the
fact that they were (with one exception) consistently in surplus, at a time when
independent sterling area countries incurred important deficits with the dollar area.
For a survey and cursory assessment of these developments, see chapter 3. It is note­
worthy, moreover, that West African surpluses occurred even during 1949–50, when
cocoa did not benefit from boom prices. The high surpluses for Malaya in 1950–1
reflect the rubber boom during the Korean War.

ling balances, see chapter 3.5
The Colonies, Economic Booms and
Trade Discrimination: Britain’s
Recovery Supported, 1947–53
During the sterling crises between 1947 and 1952, the empire occupied a
prominent position in Britain’s external economic relations and fulfilled a
pivotal role in the discriminatory management of the sterling area. The fol­
lowing analysis will cast light on the question of whether British policy
phased in a promising new imperial deal or was doomed from the start.
The international context, sanctioned by the United States, defined the fea­
sibility of Britain’s discriminatory management. The economic conditions
in the colonies determined where commodity exports were viable.
Moreover, during the 1930s and the war considerable social transforma­
tions had taken place that affected British policy in the sterling area, and
the legacy of the colonial state and its economic institutions to some
extent facilitated discriminatory management. After the war, socio-eco-
nomic movements increasingly manifested themselves politically and chal­
lenged the colonial state. British policy was a balancing act between
shielding key economic institutions and fostering austerity management to
achieve export surpluses on the one hand, and securing alliances with local
groups conducive to British aims on the other. Britain’s management of the
colonial sterling area had a distinct political rationale. The considerable lit­
erature dealing with Britain and the colonies during the period is generally
not concerned with this dimension, though it touches upon numerous
aspects of the problem. 1 However, innovative research links sterling rela­
tionships with British colonial development policy. This research and the
present account are genuinely complementary to one another. 2
1. The external environment and colonial discrimination
Specific features of the international economy and international economic
organization facilitated the realization of British policy designs towards the
periphery. The Bretton Woods Agreements of 1945 on postwar inter­
national organization advocated multilateralism as the principle of interna­
tional economic relations. However, what existed in the early postwar
8182
Money and the End of Empire
period was a multilateral trading system with a very limited degree of liber­
alization. The Bretton Woods agreements did not provide for an automatic
correction of imbalances in international trade via credit settlements
within the framework of a clearing union. Such proposals by Keynes (simi­
lar to the agreements of the European Payments Union of 1950) had been
rejected by the United States. 3 However, in view of liquidity shortages in
large parts of the world, an alternative was required, so that Bretton Woods
stood a chance of long-term realization. It was necessary during the period
of the dollar shortage to allow countries that were in balance of payments
difficulties to impose discriminatory measures in trade so that they could
remedy their external imbalances. Accordingly, the agreements included
important escape clauses for ‘war-shattered’ economies. The Anglo-
American loan agreement of 1945 was more explicitly anti-discriminatory.
However, its stipulations, too, were suspended, when Britain encountered a
run on its reserves during the convertibility crisis of 1947. 4
Most significantly, Britain was able to extend escape clauses of Bretton
Woods to the union of Britain and the imperial sterling area (including
Rhodesia) because these territories (together with Burma) held a common
reserve allotment with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 5 This
‘common quota’ clause made trade discrimination against the dollar area by
Britain feasible during the late 1940s and early 1950s. As a result, ‘triangu­
lar’ trade between the colonies, Britain and the dollar area could be
conducted the way it was. Otherwise, overall discrimination (including dis­
crimination against Britain by her own colonies for sterling area purposes)
would have been possible and was practice; but it would not have been fea­
sible for the colonies to discriminate vis-à-vis the United States in favour of
Britain. Moreover, within the sterling area, it was of course feasible for the
colonies to discriminate in favour of Britain and against the independent
Commonwealth. However, such a course met with sharp criticism in the
‘old’ Commonwealth and Britain was careful not to fuel suspicion. 6
The structure of the international economy in the late 1940s allowed
Britain to make good use of these peculiar organizational arrangements in
conducting her imperial relations. Commodity trade between the non­
industrialized periphery and industrialized countries still made up the most
important share in world trade. Moreover, there existed no international
cartel arrangements that might have levelled out price booms for the
crucial commodities of the period: cocoa, rubber, tin and wool; 7 the
marketing boards merely adjusted fluctuations on a territorial basis. There
were also certain boom periods for important commodities that sustained
Britain’s discriminatory trade arrangements via the colonies, particularly
for rubber, wool and, in certain periods, for cocoa. 8 The dollar earning
capacity of many colonies was considerable. The monitoring and predic­
tion of commodity price developments was, therefore, crucial for British
policy, 9 and the regional focus of imperial management shifted to thoseThe Colonies, Booms and Trade Discrimination 83
regions that produced the highest-priced commodities for which there was
a market in the dollar area. Therefore, besides the gold producer South
Africa, and for a while Australia, the most important countries within the
sterling area during the period were the three colonies, Malaya, Nigeria and
the Gold Coast. The former member Egypt was politically too volatile to be
relied upon.
For key economic policy-makers the discriminatory management of the
sterling area was a short-term deviation that should allow Britain to move
towards multilateralism in international economic organization; mean­
while, Britain continued on a 1930s course of discrimination and sought
adjustments of Bretton Woods to facilitate economic recovery. 10 Provisions
to opt out in international agreements and the consent of the United
States allowed Britain to pursue her discriminatory operation in the
colonies. It is ironic, however, that by providing this option, international
economic accords in the long run created problems similar to those they
had set out to remedy. One crucial aim of the schemes had been to enable
Britain to tackle the problem of her overseas sterling balances. 11 But the
route taken simply shifted the regional focus of this problem to the British
empire. Here, for a time at least, the matter rested without causing undue
concern to either the British or the Americans.
2. Economic and social conditions in the colonies
Economic conditions within the empire affected dollar earning and dollar
saving and were, therefore, relevant to the management of the British
economy during the period. Moreover, socio-economic conditions in indi­
vidual colonies could either hamper or be conducive to Britain’s needs.
Due to their potential for dollar earning, the Gold Coast and Nigeria
were vital throughout the period, but especially during the cocoa price
boom that coincided with the convertibility crisis of 1947. Malayan rubber
became highly important as a dollar earner and dollar saver in the early
period of the Korean War in 1950–1, though this was seen only as a transi­
tory development. 12 Besides, there existed exploitable minerals in various
colonies, notably tin in Malaya, and manganese in the Gold Coast, that
were in demand during the same period. Rhodesian copper was also of
importance. 13 The boosting of dollar saving by increasing colonial substi­
tute production depended on the development prospects of existing colo­
nial commodities, or on how new commodities could be promoted which
the sterling area lacked. Thus, Nigeria and East Africa were important for
fats and vegetable oils. The range of products changed in priority as a result
of changes in import prices after the devaluation of sterling. Cotton
became more important after 1949; in the early 1950s, the rice production
in Britain’s South-East Asian colonies increased in response to world short­
ages; sugar, however, had limited potential. 1484
Money and the End of Empire
The socio-economic environment in the colonies influenced the discrim­
inatory running of the sterling area; it affected the feasibility of economic
austerity and development, and, more generally, impacted on the organiza­
tion of economic relationships and on local politics. Put crudely, import
restraint depended on the kind of development projects upon which a
given territory had embarked, notably whether or not it required a large
amount of capital goods. Moreover, to check capital flows from the
London market to areas that were already rich in sterling due to their com­
modity earnings, external development finance had to be limited to imper­
ative infrastructural schemes, notably to improve rail and road transport
and harbour installations. The feasibility of austerity also hinged on the
political pressures on the colonial state that ensued from the social stratifi­
cation of colonial societies with regard to imports and priorities of develop­
ment. On the whole, after the war, the urban population, which had
swollen considerably during the 1930s and the war, opposed continued
austerity in many colonies and was keen on economic expansion.
The political and social organization of commodity producers had a
potential impact on the smooth control of production, and in a broader
manner on the management of revenues. For example, the bargaining over
commodity producer prices influenced the management of colonial infla­
tion, and thus also sterling area inflation; in consequence, it had a degree
of influence, too, on the feasibility of import restraint. 15 Colonial dollar
restrictions made public opinion and political activists in some colonies in
the long run ‘dollar-conscious’ in the opposite sense to what the British
aimed at and originally had achieved. 16 Not least the colonial financial and
monetary arrangements were open to challenges from populist claims for
an independent monetary policy and for certain forms of central bank-
ing. 17 Britain was particularly wary of demands from among indigenous
commercial entrepreneurs, which had become a recognizable force in some
colonies by the end of the 1940s, and of the involvement of such groups in
commodity production or alliances of commodity producers with these
groups. 18
With respect to the above issues, there existed marked differences in those
regions of the imperial sterling area that mattered for British policy in terms
of their economic potential. In the Gold Coast, pressure on Britain ensued
from the indigenous cocoa growers, prompted both by grievances about the
expatriate cocoa trading firms and colonial economic policies. 19 The cocoa
farmers, notably in the Ashanti region, were the territory’s elite in economic
terms. Ashanti growers had developed commercialized cocoa farming since
the beginning of the twentieth century, relying on a complex web of tradi­
tional labour and wage labour. In the late 1940s, Britain needed more than
ever to maintain a high level of Gold Coast cocoa output for exports to the
dollar area, and the cocoa producers occupied a potentially powerful place in
the territory’s political equilibrium. Therefore, the British were particularlyThe Colonies, Booms and Trade Discrimination 85
concerned about a possible production stop by the comparatively well-
organized cocoa farmers, as they had done repeatedly in the well-known
cocoa hold-ups of the 1930s. 20
Moreover, there existed in the Gold Coast local entrepreneurs involved
in the cocoa trade and in liberal professions. Since the 1920s a group of
indigenous cocoa brokers had evolved with close connections with cocoa
farmers though no direct involvement in agriculture. These sections of the
indigenous business community with a stake in the export trade were a
concern for the British because they lobbied for the improvement of local
credit facilities, which had become largely inadequate by the 1940s.
Banking for the African population, notably in rural areas, was confined to
the Post Office Savings Banks, and no indigenous banking institutions
existed. 21 Moreover, this group put pressure on import restrictions and on
colonial monetary and marketing arrangements in general.
None the less, the economic importance of the cocoa growers and
indigenous export traders was not necessarily matched by their political
influence in the colonial state. In the late 1940s, informal alliances of small
retail traders, Western-educated groups, clerks, teachers and other econom­
ically and socially marginalized sections of the population were about to
emerge in the urban centres of the Gold Coast. Britain was increasingly
confronted with grievances expressed by the urban population. For exam­
ple, textile imports were greatly in demand in the urban areas. It is, there­
fore, hardly surprising that the urban protests that swept British Africa in
1947–8 coincided with the new austerity policies imposed from London in
relation to the sterling convertibility crisis, which tightened restrictions on
consumer goods. Although these protests were generated by a variety of
local grievances, they were compounded by Britain’s sterling area policy
and, therefore, attracted wider support than had been the case earlier. 22
In Nigeria, pressures on Britain from commodity producers were conve­
niently more diffuse than in the Gold Coast because production was scat­
tered across a large number of different commodities, and because there
were considerable regional disparities in political organization. 23 Moreover,
Nigeria experienced a banking boom in the late 1940s and early 1950s. 24
In Malaya, too, pressure from producers was less strong than in the Gold
Coast. However, indigenous business interests also challenged British pol­
icy in relation to credit facilities and dollar earning. In the late 1940s and
early 1950s, British sterling area policy had greater difficulty maintaining
the desirable restraint on dollar imports than in West Africa, where such
demands were still more limited due to the smaller size of the urban popu-
lation. 25 Moreover, Malaya had been under occupation during part of the
Second World War, and a considerable amount of imports of capital goods
had to be permitted for reconstruction purposes. Malaya’s close relations
with Japan also meant that more consumer goods found their way on the
Malayan market than was the case in British colonies elsewhere. 2686
Money and the End of Empire
More importantly, however, Britain faced considerable social upheaval
in Malaya which not only posed a potential threat to rubber output, but
was a serious challenge to the administration of the territories. In the inter­
war period, the economy of the territories hinged on the rubber estates,
which were largely owned by private British firms. At the same time, a
large number of Malays were diversifying into rubber smallholdings, by
and large against the wishes of the traditional Malay rulers, who saw the
role of the Malay in subsistence farming, notably of rice. The labourers on
the estates were usually not Malay but Chinese, who had been recruited
from the Chinese mainland since the beginning of the twentieth century.
Thus, antagonisms grew between common Malays, the expatriate estates
and the traditional Malay political hierarchy, and also between the Malay
and Chinese migrants. 27 In the late 1940s, the situation was complicated
for the British by socio-economic changes that had taken place during the
1930s depression and the Japanese wartime occupation. Almost half a mil­
lion unemployed ethnic Chinese had settled as subsistence farmers on the
fringes of the jungle, where they were effectively outside British adminis­
trative control and became suppliers of food and manpower for the
Communist insurrection after the war.
East Africa did not fit well into the design of the discriminatory sterling
area. In Tanganyika, export production was too small to make a real differ­
ence for the sterling area. In Kenya, a high level of consumer goods had to
be admitted for the settler population. 28 Moreover, Kenya had a much big­
ger internal market than the other main commodity exporters of the impe­
rial sterling area. With regard to credit facilities, the situation also differed
from that in most other colonies since in Kenya some form of local money
market already existed which served the white settler and Indian commu­
nities. Still, for infrastructural development Kenya’s demands on the
London money market were stronger than those of other colonies. 29
Put in a wider context, British policy in Kenya was hampered by strained
relations with indigenous commercial entrepreneurs and with settler pro­
ducers. The British were also deceived by their own misinterpretation of
social changes in the territory. Kenya’s economic elite in the making origi­
nated from Kikuyuland, where indigenous commercial wattle entrepre­
neurs emerged in the interwar period. This group found a profitable niche
market and was able to reinvest because it relied on both wage labour and
labour obtained by kinship ties, and because the group’s members engaged
in business activities while at the same time receiving an income from
employment in the state or parastatal sector (‘straddling’, as it is called). In
the late 1940s, these Kikuyu entrepreneurs diversified into dairy farming
for the local market and tea growing for export, which made them a pow­
erful economic group in the country and a direct competitor to both the
white settler producers and state-led smallholder production, on which
Britain based her new development initiatives at the time. 30The Colonies, Booms and Trade Discrimination 87
The socio-economic changes related to the emergence and development
of this group also led to consequential social changes which ultimately
led to serious civil confrontation in the colony, commonly known as the
Mau revolt. In the 1940s and early 1950s, a sharp antagonism developed
between the entrepreneurs and both small agriculturalists in Kikuyuland and
returning Kikuyu from the White Highlands. In the interwar period, the
white settlers had welcomed these Kikuyu cattle herders as a cheap residen­
tial labour force. However, in the 1940s the cattle herders came into conflict
with the interests of the settlers who had moved into dairy farming and were
concerned about competition from the labourers and also about diseases
among their lower-grade cattle. The settlers then switched to migrant labour
that did not engage in cattle herding, and evicted the residential labourers.
As a result, land became increasingly scarce in Kikuyuland, when the evicted
Kikuyu returned home. The Kikuyu entrepreneurs now legalized traditional
property rights in their favour, which ultimately was a key factor in provok­
ing a momentous social conflict.
These socio-economic transformations were indirectly related to British
colonialism and influenced British policy towards Kenya. However, the
ensuing social conflict was no simple direct reaction against British colonial
rule and policy. None the less, the socio-economic constellation hampered
the specific British development drive in Kenya, and was one more reason
why the country, unlike Malaya or the Gold Coast, ultimately had little
relevance to Britain’s management of the imperial sterling area.
3. The colonial state and the discriminatory sterling area
The nature of the colonial state and its institutions influenced the manage­
ment of the imperial sterling area. The colonial state mediated between the
various local environments in the colonies and Britain’s overall require­
ments in imperial economic policy. Up to a point, Britain was able to shape
colonial states, and colonial governments were running and controlling
economic institutions with close consideration to the requirements of the
British economy. However, colonial states were also subject to constraints
from the diverse local socio-economic contexts which found their political
expression by focusing on a given state framework. While the constitu­
tional changes in colonial states that widened local political participation
occurred in a largely separate realm, these reforms to some extent served as
social control, thereby making Britain’s management of the imperial ster­
ling area feasible. 31
During the sterling crises between 1947 and 1952 the colonial state was
strengthened as a control mechanism. Control over the currency boards
and the marketing boards, where they existed, and over development
schemes was crucial for Britain. The key institutions and arrangements that
governed imperial economic relations had grown out of the legacy of88
Money and the End of Empire
Britain’s priorities, and any changes affecting their control depended upon
British consent. 32 Colonial financial and monetary arrangements were orig­
inally designed to serve expatriate exporters at the beginning of the twenti­
eth century by standardizing and facilitating exchange with Britain. 33
The colonial currency boards were operated by statute as an automatic
mechanism. 34 In the late 1940s and early 1950s, they were particularly
important for the management of ‘unrequited’ exports because changes in
the full currency cover would have heightened claims on Britain’s financial
resources. As long as the colonial monetary institutions functioned accord­
ing to the required principles, it was of no consequence where they oper­
ated. The West African and East African currency boards (WACB/EACB)
operated in London, whereas the Malayan currency board had its seat in
the colony. Nor would it matter if a local currency and central bank were
established in any particular territory, unless the bank was empowered to
change the currency board mechanisms, that is, manage the colonial cur­
rency and pursue an independent monetary policy.
In 1947, Britain established state-led commodity marketing boards in
West Africa. In the 1930s, the colonial government had intervened to
shield producers from the export firms to calm political unrest there. Such
state control in marketing had been continuing during the war. In contrast
to the colonial currency boards, the marketing boards in West Africa 35
involved a bargaining process between representatives of the colonial state
and producers. This bargaining was relevant to Britain’s management of
the imperial sterling area in two ways: in so far as it affected the level of
reserve funds designed to smooth out commodity fluctuations and guaran­
teed the long-term viability of commodity exports; and in so far as decisions
taken by the boards decreased the sterling balances and increased inflation­
ary pressures, which then had to be counterbalanced by other means.
Unofficial majorities could negatively affect these concerns, and, moreover,
challenge the way in which surpluses could be employed. However, in real­
ity such influence was limited, since the Colonial Office could check
unwelcome opposition by appropriate appointments to the boards.
The colonial state also played a role in the execution of import controls.
For example, in 1949 a procedure was established to improve allocations of
restricted commodities via supply departments in the colonies and the
Supply Department of the Colonial Office. Distribution was then con­
trolled by colonial governments. So, adjustments were made to make poli­
cies and established mechanisms operate more smoothly. 36
Politically, colonial states operated under a broad spectrum of constitu­
tional arrangements, reflecting the different social and economic condi­
tions in individual colonies. Changes in political institutions followed
the evolutionary conception of British colonialism on the ‘graduation’
of colonies as they ‘matured’. Institutional reform, moreover, reflected
the central strand of British colonial thinking which aimed at minimizingThe Colonies, Booms and Trade Discrimination 89
conflict by non-interference. However, the state was expected to interfere
when fundamental British aspirations were at stake. Since the 1930s, socio­
economic changes required constitutional adjustments in order to guaran­
tee smooth government. From the late 1940s, such adjustments were made
with the gradual establishment of representative Parliamentary structures
and territorial legislative assemblies, namely in the Gold Coast in 1951. 37
None the less, such changes did not extend to the key financial and mon­
etary fields. In 1948, Britain made adjustments in local financial manage­
ment in order to increase the efficiency of the colonial state by involving
local commissioners in the selection and control of welfare schemes, and by
improving consultation arrangements with the Colonial Office. However,
this was an attempt to attune local financial management to the social and
economic transformation that had taken place in certain colonies rather
than a shift in the fundamentals of British policy towards economic self-
government. 38 Similarly, proposals for the transfer of the currency boards
from London to East and West Africa from 1953 derived from political and
educational considerations and changed nothing in the boards’ opera-
tion. 39 At that time, access to credit (in the London market) was still dealt
with, by statute, at the level of the colonial state, while no regional govern­
ment provisions applied, as they did for Britain. London explicitly retained
its statutory and quasi-statutory powers with respect to external economic
relations, monetary and fiscal matters, the control of inflation and London
market loans. The status of colonial governors and local officials was
defined by statutes which left these crucial powers, in legal parlance, to
‘H.[is/Her] M.[ajesty]’s pleasure’, and the legislative councils, even under an
unofficial majority, had no formal influence in these matters.
Meanwhile, various social groups manifested themselves politically vis-à-
vis the colonial state, which had implications for British policy in the impe­
rial sterling area. In the Gold Coast, new political parties were organized in
the urban centres, rather than Ashantiland, drawing support from sections
of the population that had hitherto lacked a power base. From these
alliances emerged, among others, the Convention People’s Party (CPP)
under the leadership of Kwame Nkrumah in 1949. This party became the
country’s principal nationalist movement. Ultimately, the CPP marginalized
the Ashanti economic elite which had worried Britain in the 1930s.
However, in the late 1940s the party was still able to rally many cocoa farm­
ers by taking up their grievances related to the effects of a disease that was
destroying cocoa plants at the time. Urban entrepreneurs and liberal profes­
sions eventually regrouped in the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC). 40
In Nigeria, the federal structure of the colonial state meant that movements
with a strong national rather than regional orientation were slow to emerge.
In the Malayan territories, the colonial state traditionally had relied on co­
operation with the Malay aristocracy and in the economic realm supported
the British rubber estates rather than rubber smallholdings. In the aftermath90
Money and the End of Empire
of the war, the colonial government was faced with problems of reconstruc­
tion, the requirements of export management in the sterling area during
the rubber export boom and with the Communist insurgency. The colonial
state became more centralized and for the first time needed to integrate a
broader basis of the heterogeneous populations in one state, namely a cross-
section of the Malay as well as the Chinese and Tamil communities, with
largely different economic backgrounds. With the United Malays National
Organization (UMNO), a broadly based political party representing the eth­
nic Malay finally emerged in 1946. Meanwhile, British firms lost much of
their influence in the colonial state, while the Labour government tried to
foster new alliances. 41
In Kenya, the white settlers had gained a key position in the political bod­
ies of the colonial state during the war, and also considerable leverage over
the marketing of their products. The socio-economic tensions in Kenya, par­
ticularly in Kikuyuland, had a political dimension too. The Kikuyu entrepre­
neurial elite, organized in the Kenya African Union (KAU) with Jomo
Kenyatta as an important leader, challenged both the settler-dominated
organs of the state, namely the Legislative and Executive Councils, and the
authority of the traditional chiefs in Kikuyuland that were allied to the
colonial administration. 42
Within these diverse local political settings, Britain formulated colonial
policy.
4. The shaping of colonial policy
British policy was mainly concerned with import control, the boosting of
exports, and the control of financial and currency arrangements. 43
Measures in these fields were modified in connection with Britain’s crises
in external economic relations.
In West Africa and Malaya Britain tightly controlled imports. In the Gold
Coast, she imposed rigid import restrictions in 1947 and overruled assess­
ments made by the colonial government on textile requirements. In 1948,
the Dollar Drain Committee curtailed the earlier Gold Coast proposals for
textile imports, which it judged to be excessive. However, this was a grave
miscalculation, which contributed to the notorious Accra riots. 44 More tex­
tiles were eventually provided from non-dollar markets. In the early 1950s,
the British sought sterling substitutes to accommodate import restraints
from the dollar area and to market British goods more forcefully. 45
However, even during the crisis period, British policy succeeded in radically
checking dollar imports. In Malaya, the territory’s reconstruction needs
notwithstanding, the British wished to restrict imports according to the
same principles as in other colonial territories. 46 However, the country’s
dollar expenditure was erratic and even increased following the measures
introduced in the aftermath of the convertibility crisis in 1947. OfficialsThe Colonies, Booms and Trade Discrimination 91
attributed the problem to flaws in planning rather than control, 47 and
sought measures to check this development. From mid-1948 until the end
of the year a total ban on textile imports from the United States (textiles
and vehicles made up about half of Malaya’s dollar imports) was exe-
cuted. 48 Dollar imports of consumer goods were prohibited, disregarding
price differentials, and dollar imports of raw materials and spare parts were
permitted only in cases where they were 15–20 per cent cheaper than avail­
able products from sterling or ‘soft’ currency sources. 49 By early 1950, the
level of Malayan dollar expenditure had been considerably reduced, not
least because by that time Japanese and German textiles had become avail­
able for sterling. 50 However, Malaya continued to have problems of
remaining exactly within the established dollar ceilings. 51 None the less, in
the early 1950s British restrictions on steel exports posed problems in
expanding Malayan rubber and tin production. 52 In 1953, the Malayan
government increased pressure on London for easing dollar restrictions.
Supplies from the dollar area were needed because the persistent shortage
in provisions from Britain compromised Malayan economic development. 53
East Africa and the West Indies were treated very differently by the
British. There is little evidence that much pressure was brought on Kenya
to cut down its dollar imports radically. Imports of consumer goods from
the dollar area were allowed to a larger extent than elsewhere, although
attempts were made to save dollars by importing textiles from Japan. Yet
despite these rather lax import policies, the East African High Commission
expressed concern in 1952 about Britain’s colonial import programmes
because they denied ‘incentive’ goods to stimulate production. 54 In the
West Indies, the British took exception to tight import restrictions because
North American (United States, Canada, Newfoundland) trade was particu­
larly important for the region. 55 None the less, anxieties over Caribbean
dollar spending did exist, 56 and the reduction target for 1948, for example,
was one-third of the previous annual level. 57 But on the whole, even after
the convertibility crisis of 1947, policy sought a balance. The British aimed
at reducing West Indian dollar expenditure without offending the
Americans, while at the same time increasing production and receipts from
the tourist industry which hindered control. 58
On the export side, commodity output was hampered by low world
prices for rubber and tin in 1947. Moreover, the British were aware of prob­
lems relating to colonial commodities over which they had little influence.
Tin, of which Malaya together with Nigeria produced about 43 per cent of
the world’s production, faced saturated markets by 1953. 59 Malaya, which
produced about 40 per cent of the world’s natural rubber, was experiencing
growing competition with synthetic rubber produced in the United States.
Temporarily, however, the British were able to take advantage of the enor­
mous rubber boom of 1950–1 at the beginning of the Korean War, and
thereafter rubber prices continued above the level of 1947.92
Money and the End of Empire
Between 1946 and 1948–9, when rubber prices and production were low,
British policy promoted West African cocoa as the best available alternative
for improving the sterling area’s balance of payments. Cocoa began to
occupy the role which Malayan rubber had held before the war in the
empire’s commodity earnings. 60 Importantly, export prices for cocoa expe­
rienced a boom between 1946 and 1948. 61 However, in 1948–9 cocoa out­
put was retarded by a disease that affected cocoa trees in the Gold Coast, 62
and no significant increases in output could be expected over a long
period. Therefore, the British attempted to reduce the risk of crop failure
while taking advantage of price booms. Moreover, officials now heavily
relied on the state marketing of the cocoa crop via the marketing boards.
In the early 1950s, British policy was also influenced by expert advice that
expected the cocoa world price to fall. 63 None the less, on the whole, cocoa
exports to the dollar area were highly profitable, particularly in the late
1940s. The accumulation in revenues was such that these effectively frozen
funds, in turn, posed growing problems within the marketing boards and
the political alliances related to them. 64
In East Africa, the British boosted sisal as the postwar alternative to
Malayan rubber as a dollar earner. 65 East Africa was also the key area where
Britain in the late 1940s promoted new commodity production for dollar
saving rather than increasing the efficiency of well-established old crops.
The groundnut schemes were the most notable in this connection. After
1949, the production of raw cotton was stepped up in all East African
colonies and new contracts with the Raw Cotton Commission concluded.
This policy continued during the early 1950s. 66 Similar steps were taken in
Nigeria. 67 However, by 1951 the British had become increasingly anxious
that the introduction of new development schemes simultaneously added
to demands for imports, not only of capital goods, but also of consumer
goods. 68 The phasing in of new development schemes was scaled down
after the failure of the Tanganyika groundnut scheme, the Gambia egg
scheme, and others. Instead, British policy refocused on the production of
existing crops that still had potential for sterling area purposes. Outside the
key geographical areas of imperial economic policy, in Rhodesia and
Uganda copper continued to be a valuable export commodity in the early
1950s. 69 Moreover, some attempts were made to increase rice production in
the South-East Asian colonies. 70 By contrast, the colonial involvement in
the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement meant that West Indian sugar
exports were hampered, since the colonies had been expected to reach the
original quota by the early mid-1950s. 71
British policy on the sterling balances of individual colonies corre­
sponded to the management of ‘unrequited’ exports that followed from
restrictive import policies and export promotion. In the late 1940s, the
Bank of England tacitly assumed that areas like West Africa and Malaya
were convenient holders of sterling balances. Their balances would be lessThe Colonies, Booms and Trade Discrimination 93
volatile, not least because colonial policy and institutional changes could
more easily be subjected to British control than elsewhere. 72 The problem
area was the Middle East and Indian Ocean region, namely India and
Ceylon. In India, dollar restraint and import restrictions were difficult to
maintain in view of the sizeable urban population. Similarly, in the late
1940s Ceylon was determined to pursue an independent course with regard
to its dollar revenues, and sought a closer association with the United
States. In the Middle East, oil balances were difficult to control and anyway
discriminatory management was opposed by the United States. Moreover,
sterling area members, such as Hong Kong, India and Pakistan, Rhodesia or
even Australia, were not necessarily considered to be indispensable parts of
the discriminatory sterling area, since they operated with insufficient dol­
lar restraint. 73 In West Africa, by contrast, the British were confident that
they could model the local situation in a way that did not disturb sterling
area relationships. 74
Both Britain’s general attitude towards socio-economic groups in individ­
ual colonies and British policy in dealing with local demands that affected
the financial and monetary realm, were, to a degree, extensions of British
concerns about the smooth functioning of the imperial sterling area.
Moreover, the success or failure of emerging nationalist parties was partly
affected by British policy and its priorities.
Faced with forcefully emerging political organizations in the Gold Coast
at the beginning of the 1950s, British policy gave cautious support to the
urban-based nationalist movement as an alternative to political groupings
related to the Ashanti cocoa growers and indigenous export traders. In
Malaya, British policy under Labour slackened its previously firm and
costly support for the British rubber firms. Policy became more favourably
inclined towards the Malay smallholdings, which in the 1940s became
more profitable than the expatriate estates. However, British policy also
attempted to divert smallholder production towards alternative products,
such as palm oil, and away from rubber, which was seen to have little long-
term prospects on the world market. In the late 1940s and early 1950s,
Britain carried out a huge resettlement scheme, moving Chinese subsis­
tence farmers from the fringes of the jungle, combined with an urbanization
programme. The aim was to quell the Communist insurrection by remov­
ing its support base, and to bring the farmers under British administrative
control while withdrawing them from an area where they were subject to
coercion by the guerrillas to provide food, shelter and soldiers. In Kenya,
British policy saw a need to reduce settler influence for political reasons
while at the same time instigating African economic development that
suited sterling area priorities. The numerous state-led production schemes
sponsored by the Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) from 1948 are
evidence of this. 75 The aim was to develop a strong African smallholder
production as an alternative to both settler production and the straddling94
Money and the End of Empire
African entrepreneur. At the same time, Britain proceeded to squash the
Mau Mau revolt by attempting to seek out the rebels’ political power base
during the emergency from 1952, and especially by advancing against the
fighters militarily in 1954.
From the perspective of her priorities in the imperial sterling area, Britain
faced the most disturbing challenges in the Gold Coast in the late 1940s. 76
The British were wary of demands coming from the indigenous business
sector with an interest in export trade. These were well represented by
J.B. Danquah, the leader of the UGCC, and his allies in the Ashanti
Farmers Union. 77 In the late 1940s, Danquah lobbied for improved credit
facilities for Africans and for the establishment of an agricultural bank and
of a ‘state bank’, albeit ill-defined, to boost development. He was also in
the forefront of criticism launched against the cocoa marketing board’s
retention of the territory’s dollar revenues without adequate compensation
by way of development loans.
Officials attempted to steer these demands into acceptable channels, and
acknowledged deficiencies in the existing banking arrangements. In 1948,
the Bank of England, the Colonial Office and the Gold Coast government
accepted that an agricultural bank, or some other form of commercial
bank, established and supervised by the state, might meet a genuine
need among African business clients. The Watson Commission, which
investigated the Accra protests of 1948, also proposed the establishment of
a Cocoa Farmers Bank. 78 The Gold Coast Industrial Development Corpo­
ration and Gold Coast Agricultural Development Corporation were
founded in order to mollify local concerns about the promotion of devel-
opment. 79 At the end of the 1940s, the British were satisfied that the modi­
fied credit facilities would adequately meet local requirements and now
saw the priority to be education. From the economic perspective, a state
bank was no longer needed. 80
None the less, in the early 1950s, demands for a state bank were kept
alive by local lobbying, notably by Danquah, which the British now hoped
to counter by educational exercises on finance and banking. 81 For example,
the British pondered the establishment of an African bank supervised by
Europeans that should teach the public that money could not be obtained
ad infinitum without being repaid, and bring home the message that credit­
worthiness was required first. 82 However, the Trevor Report, commissioned
in April 1951, recommended the creation of more credit facilities in the
Gold Coast. The Bank of England was highly dissatisfied with the report
since it felt that it undermined the Bank’s stance against unsound banking
practices and basically conceded some form of state bank. 83 By the early
1950s, the problems posed by local lobbying had shifted to an area that
was potentially more harmful to Britain than local demands for a commer­
cial state bank, when such demands turned from banking to currency mat­
ters in general. Danquah took inspiration from the Ceylonese example, 84The Colonies, Booms and Trade Discrimination 95
the ‘thorn in the flesh’ 85 of Britain’s management of banking and currency
matters in the sterling area, and demanded a Gold Coast Bank of Issue, and
thus a ‘managed’ Gold Coast currency. 86 This effectively challenged the
existing arrangements of the West African Currency Board, which was one
of the pillars of the colonial economic relationship. In the following, pol-
icy-makers planned precautionary strategies, adamant that the Ceylonese
experience must not be repeated. Plans included the local administering of
currency boards in West Africa, and officials cogitated a strategy on how to
phase in a ‘central bank’ that issued currency yet at the same time
remained a currency board in all but name. In 1953, the British saw such
steps as expedient, though they made their implementation dependent on
local developments. 87
5. The logic of colonial discrimination
British policies towards individual colonies were supposed to bear out the
crucial designs which the government followed with respect to the discrim­
inatory sterling area as a whole. 88 The British pursued different strategies to
make the diverse parts of the empire conform to the same overall policy
requirements, by seeking allies, by lobbying for policies and by the appro­
priate monitoring of the existing economic institutions. Strategies were
importantly affected by perceived political opportunities and constraints in
the sterling area, and underpinned by a specific development doctrine.
The arrangements of the discriminatory sterling area required a high
degree of import restraint in any one territory to maximize trade surpluses
and improve the balance of payments of Britain and the sterling area and
ease the pressure on the reserves. Policy-makers were anxious to control
imports by the empire’s largest dollar earners, Malaya and the Gold Coast.
It was important in this connection that the orthodox British monetary
and marketing arrangements were preserved, since this meant that
exchange surpluses would automatically accumulate as sterling balances.
The Colonial Office’s position was closely bound up with its view that
colonial development and British recovery were the same. For example,
when at the Conference on Techniques of Development Finance in 1951
Kenya expressed its wish to be allowed to introduce a fiduciary issue for its
currency, the Colonial Office found the issue so delicate that it decided not
to include it in the final report. 89 Production was boosted in commodities
and regions which might contribute most to the sterling area’s balance of
payments. The British wished to make full use of existing institutions that
facilitated the management of ‘unrequited’ exports in support of the ster­
ling area. The wider policy rationale is also visible in relation to develop­
ment finance, which was targeted on schemes aimed at boosting
commodity exports and was allocated sparingly to holders of a large
amount of sterling balances. It was crucial, too, that the marketing boards96
Money and the End of Empire
in West Africa remained committed to cautious producer-price policies and
essential that both forced and voluntary savings were promoted in order to
reduce the risks of inflation. At the same time, in the early 1950s, a bank­
ing system had to be put in place that could provide adequate local saving
opportunities in the absence of a real local money market. British investi­
gations and policy in relation to local banking were also aimed at contra­
vening possible calls on the London money market by taking gradual steps
towards a local money market. The Bank of England hoped such measures
would play an additional role in assuaging the pressures on colonial
economies that resulted from the restrictive import policies and the accu­
mulation of sterling balances. 90
Even where British policy seemingly disregarded its general principles,
exceptions were made with the broader purposes in mind. In those areas
that were not the pivots of the empire, the British strove to minimize dam­
age, if they could not maximize gains. For example, in 1949 the Imports
Diversion Committee agreed not to increase the provision of raw cotton
from East Africa to Britain at the expense of India, since this would only
have led to a rise in Indian imports from the United States. 91 Similarly,
concerning import restrictions, West Indian trade was liberalized for cer­
tain items in 1952, as a concession to Canada, which had important trade
relations with the region. 92 The less strict control of dollar expenditure by
Britain’s West Indian colonies also had an important political connotation.
A higher percentage of West Indian imports of foodstuffs originated
in North America than in any other colony; a reduction in these imports
that could not be replaced by other sources considerably increased the cost
of living. 93
Sterling area policy meshed with colonial development doctrines.
Development on the periphery was meant to meet the production require­
ments that suited discriminatory trade flow management. However, the
implementation of production schemes on the periphery also corre­
sponded to the predilections of Colonial Office trusteeship that had
evolved into Fabian reformism. Therefore, colonial developers lent support
to African smallholder production under the aegis of the state. The
assumption was that such development could be easily controlled and was
not prone to social conflict. Support for smallholders was also politically
preferable to the backing of the emerging straddling elites involved in com­
mercialized agriculture, who moreover evoked old anxieties among British
officials of ‘detribalized’, and therefore ungovernable, Africans in settler
colonies. Alternatively, Britain sought out allies among political elites deta­
ched from the main economic forces.
The rationale of British policy at the territorial level had a distinctly polit­
ical dimension. The limits of political reform were defined by Britain’s need
to retain her sovereignty and authority in matters affecting external eco­
nomic policy. Debates about constitutional changes in the colonies wereThe Colonies, Booms and Trade Discrimination 97
directed with these limitations in mind. 94 The Colonial Office was mainly
responsible for providing an environment suitable for the smooth function­
ing of the imperial economic relationship. For the period of the late 1940s
and early 1950s, the Gold Coast constitutes the most pertinent case. 95
The confluence of the previously marginal urban nationalist ‘elite’ in the
CPP under Nkrumah owed its success not least to a strange complementar­
ity to British policy at the beginning of the 1950s. The CCP was a blessing
in disguise for the British at a time when radical policy changes on market­
ing and monetary management might have had disastrous effects for
Britain. Nkrumah coupled political radicalism with welcome economic
moderation, and, according to his slogan, ‘[first sought] the political king-
dom’. 96 This ironically turned the staunch nationalist into a moderate ally
from the viewpoint of British policy-makers throughout the period. The
Bank of England held Nkrumah in high esteem as a sensible politician who
could be used to influence some of his less reasonable colleagues. 97
Moreover, Nkrumah drew on a different constituency from his main politi­
cal opponent, Danquah, and his more radical demands for political conces­
sions gave him a suitably wide appeal. By its ability to deliver political
reform, the CPP in turn solved its legitimization problem and was able to
overcome the problem of its feeble economic power base, namely vis-à-vis
the cocoa growers, indigenous entrepreneurs and traditional chiefs. Thus,
in essence, the political became detached from the economic realm,
and the marginalization of the cocoa growers and indigenous entrepre­
neurs in the running of the state in the long-term enhanced antagonisms
in the country.
For the British, their tacit alliance with Nkrumah allowed the smooth
marketing of cocoa and prevented changes in marketing and monetary
arrangements by keeping at bay both the indigenous commercial cocoa
growers and the indigenous export traders. Propping up Nkrumah, by pro­
viding advice on how best to counter the demands of his opponents in the
economic realm, and trading political reform for continuity in colonial
monetary and financial arrangements appeared the best available strategy,
and was the alternative to the previously privileged alliance with the tradi­
tional chiefs. Apart from that, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, cocoa mar­
keting by the state intervened between the expatriate traders and the
indigenous growers and diffused political tension. Local export entrepre­
neurs, organized in the UGCC under Danquah, were still a considerable
nuisance for the British in the late 1940s because of their demands for
loans, for the abandonment of dollar pooling, and for changes in the mon­
etary arrangements, including demands for a central bank. Danquah,
though definitely ill-informed in many of his economic demands, had
clearly realized that his lobbying for a Bank of Issue (Central Bank) was
what scared the British most. And he used this issue skilfully for his own
political purposes against Nkrumah, who was satisfied with a commercial98
Money and the End of Empire
state bank as defined in the Bank of Gold Coast Bill. 98 By the early 1950s,
however, Danquah conveniently had become a marginalized political fig-
ure. 99 One might still argue that Britain’s reliance on Nkrumah was a rather
short-sighted strategy. In the long run, his constituency could not be
expected to be the most important in the Gold Coast once immediate
political aims had been achieved.
Somewhat similar to developments in the Gold Coast, the more forceful
emergence of Malayan political nationalism suited rather than worried offi­
cials concerned with the management of Britain’s imperial economic rela­
tions in the late 1940s and early 1950s. UMNO developed from its
foundation in 1946 into an alternative to Chinese and Tamil influences in
the territories. Malayan nationalism empowered those groups within the
territories that had something to gain from obtaining political concessions
from the British and whose socio-economic background made them at the
same time less likely to challenge Britain unduly in matters of colonial
export promotion and finance. 100 In the late 1940s, unlike during the
1930s, British policy welcomed rubber production from all sources, includ­
ing smallholders, to boost rubber exports for dollar earning, in competition
with both synthetic rubber and Indonesian natural rubber. Moreover, the
Fabian-inspired development doctrine saw smallholder production as the
backbone of colonial economies and was critical of the big firm. It is no
mere coincidence that the nationalist UMNO became, in essence, the eth­
nic Malay smallholder party with which Britain was able to foster a reliable
new political alliance congenial to her needs.
At the same time, the British knew that they could build on relations
with part of the Chinese business community which was interested in a
stable economic climate for the export sector, notably in Singapore.
However, Britain needed to solve the problem of the Communist insurrec­
tion, which she succeeded in doing against all the odds. The British reset­
tlement scheme during the Malayan Emergency was successful, not least
due to a number of fortunate coincidences. The scheme could be financed
with income from the rubber boom of the Korean War. Moreover, a high
demand for labour existed because of the rubber boom and the increased
competition between estates and smallholdings. In addition, wages on the
estates were high and other incentives were given to skilled rubber tappers,
available among the Chinese. Tappers might also get the opportunity to
share in profits on smallholdings or even be able to use income to launch
their own business, which had been an old dream of many migrants. 101
Elsewhere within the empire, the constellation of local politics and eco­
nomic requirements was far less problematic for the British than it was in
the Gold Coast and in Malaya. Considering the whole picture, even the
Gold Coast incidents were merely unwelcome hitches in what was other­
wise a remarkably smooth operation of the imperial sterling area. The
British were aware of the danger of the currency debate and demands inThe Colonies, Booms and Trade Discrimination 99
the Gold Coast spilling over to Nigeria. 102 Unlike in the Gold Coast, in
Nigeria a number of African banks already existed and these alleviated
claims for adequate credit facilities for the African population. The local
banking boom needed to be regulated, however. 103 Central banking was
not the most pressing political demand in the colony, which was also polit­
ically concerned more with the sorting out of regional constitutional mat­
ters, which suited the British well. 104
Kenya posed considerable problems for British policy and diplomacy dur­
ing the Mau Mau revolt, which essentially was a Kikuyu civil war. However,
the emergency soon became localized, when the guerrillas, faced with
British military might, were forced to withdraw into the bush. British pol­
icy was unsophisticated in dealing with the conflict in Kenya, not least
because policy-makers were unable to interpret its social dimension.
Officials wrongly attributed Mau Mau to support from political groups,
notably related to the KAU under Kenyatta. The British sought no alliance
with the emerging African political elite in Kenya, which, unlike in the
Gold Coast, also was the economic vanguard. The settler influence dimin­
ished. However, the Kikuyu entrepreneurs continued to gain strength.
More importantly from the perspective of this account, Kenya never was a
key constituent of the imperial sterling area, and British policies on Mau
Mau are therefore quite separate from the problems discussed here.
However, in 1947 Kenya was still considered to have potential for the ster­
ling area, and the failure of British development schemes in the country
was also due (apart from problems with competitiveness on the world mar­
ket and technical mismanagement) to the inability of the smallholdings to
compete against the commercial entrepreneurs among the Kikuyu.
6. Conclusion
A synopsis of this and the previous chapter shows how and why Britain
and her empire became more closely associated during the major structural
sterling crises between 1947 and 1953. The account has extracted the
essence of Britain’s imperial relations as part of her contemporary external
economic relations.
During the period, Britain desperately sought opportunities to improve
her balance of payments and reserve position within the sterling area and
to re-establish an equilibrium in her exchange relations with the dollar
area. British policy-makers were considerably constrained in this attempt
by the following factors: the low production levels of Britain’s industries;
the recovery problems of other independent countries; the United States’
push towards the liberalization of the world economy but its reluctance to
grant credits to Britain; and Labour’s objective of consolidating the posi­
tion of the new middle classes within the British polity by providing state
welfarism.100 Money and the End of Empire
For a number of reasons, the empire could facilitate British aims. First,
discriminatory management of the imperial part of the sterling area was
possible, since there existed loopholes in international economic arrange­
ments concerning the ‘war-shattered’ European economies. There was also
the tacit acceptance by the United States that the colonies were important,
if Britain was to remedy her structural trade disequilibrium; ‘unrequited’
exports and the accumulation of sterling balances in the colonies were
preferable to other options.
Second, commodity trade with the periphery was important during the
period, and commodity price booms helped in the accumulation of colo­
nial sterling balances. The peculiarities of colonial monetary arrangements
and state marketing sustained an accumulation of the balances and an
anti-inflationary policy.
Third, there were reasons why these arrangements were not challenged
unduly during the period within the colonies themselves, though pressures
increased, notably in the Gold Coast. Import restraint could be more suc­
cessfully sustained in territories with a relatively small urban elite that had
only limited formal influence in the running of the territory. Even as the
political and constitutional realm widened, Britain was successful in retain­
ing control over colonial institutions and arrangements that mattered for
the sterling area. Political reform was able to divert attention from substan­
tial economic relationships and problems of the management of colonial
economies. It also made perfect sense in certain sub-contexts to follow the
British lead; in others, there were objectively few alternatives. However, it
is important to realize that the rationale of policy followed Britain’s
requirements, not those of the colonies. The implementation of policy was
shaped by the mutual influences of Britain’s design of external economic
relations and the Fabian-inspired doctrine of colonial development.
On the whole, Britain consciously co-opted the empire in her external
economic relations. This policy provided considerable support for Britain’s
economy during the period. Moreover, there were grand designs for devel­
oping the empire in a protectionist world. But the discriminatory manage­
ment of empire was unlikely to last, for two main reasons: its inevitably
diminishing returns, and the fact that colonial economic development
undermined selective discrimination. Thus, the empire provided a rela­
tively easy option during economic crises. None the less, key policy-makers
kept their eyes firmly on the wider aims of reintegrating Britain into a mul­
tilateral international economic order.
By 1953, the established management of the imperial sterling area had
become problematic. Moreover, attempts to boost the production of new
colonial commodities had failed. At that time, Britain attempted to pursue its
own initiatives towards the convertibility of sterling with greater resolve. The
level of the colonial sterling balances had swollen considerably. The belief
that these balances did not constitute claims on Britain was not one adheredThe Colonies, Booms and Trade Discrimination 101
to by the Bank of England and the Treasury. Meanwhile, pressures for change
increased in some colonies in relation to colonial monetary arrangements,
the provision of development finance, and import liberalization to boost
development. The following two chapters will address these issues.

Establishing the ceilings of individual territories in individual categories of goods
was the main quantitative work of government departments concerned with colo­
nial economic management during the period. The figures available on these issues
are detailed. However, policy-makers focused on the practical concern of establish­
ing, imposing and monitoring the ceilings. Systematic estimates of the level of colo­
nial dollar imports without ceilings were made only in 1947–8 and in 1955.
Similarly, policy-makers did not go beyond an ad hoc retrospective assessment in
comparing targets with actual figures. Moreover, the changing regional emphasis in
policy influenced the collection of data. For example, the Digest of Colonial Statistics
excluded actual figures for East Africa because East Africa was not considered to be
vital in dollar saving. The available material is therefore sketchy, despite its bulk.
On the whole, policy-makers were satisfied with the achieved reduction of dollar
expenditure in comparison with the set targets. Moreover, they judged that theThe Colonies, Booms and Trade Discrimination 103

degree of dollar imports would have been about 50–80 per cent higher than without
restrictions (in an overall total that excluded Hong Kong). However, it is not clear
whether or not it was expected that this level would be sustained over a period of
several years. In general, and particularly in the case of Malaya, the considerably
higher figures for estimates than for ‘actuals’ in 1948 and 1949 reflect the initial
problems with the management of dollar ceilings. Policy-makers admitted failure in
the case of Malaya. The relatively limited increase in Malayan dollar expenditure
under conditions of dollar liberalization is due to the fact that the bulk of its overall
increases in imports was expected to lie with other hard currency areas, notably
Japan.

Divergence: Britain, Empire and
Planned Liberalization, 1953–566
Britain and Economic
Liberalization: Imperial Relations
Adjusted, 1953–56
The period 1953–56 was characterized by some degree of economic liberal­
ization in Britain’s foreign economic and financial relations. Britain’s grad­
ual retreat from discriminatory policies influenced her imperial relations
and posed problems in colonial economic management and imperial con­
trol. The transformation towards a more liberal British welfare state and
the move towards the convertibility of sterling impacted on imperial
relations, as did progress towards liberal multilateralism in international
organization and economic cooperation in Europe. However, Britain app­
roached the liberalization in trade and payments hesitatingly, especially in
the empire. This course was hazardous because of Britain’s continuing vul­
nerable position in the international economy, and the United States’
reluctance to support Britain financially. The shaping of imperial policy
reflects Britain’s ambitions as well as her concerns. The legacy of her man­
agement of the discriminatory period and the huge accumulated colonial
sterling balances in particular entailed conflicts in the empire, when liber­
alizing Britain’s external economic policy. This endeavour brought differ­
ent policy agendas on imperial liberalization of British government
departments to the fore, indicating changes in the British polity. The fol­
lowing account focuses on the transformation of British imperial relations
and policies, by taking a broad view of economic liberalization; the precise
manifestations of liberalization in their own right will unavoidably take
second stage. None the less, joining an account of Britain’s economic liber­
alization and imperial relations is new territory which will also draw atten­
tion to the hitherto neglected political aspects of economic liberalization
during the period in general. 1
1. The liberalizing welfare state
The return to power of a Tory government in late 1951 occurred when the
limits of discriminatory sterling management were becoming apparent.
107108 Money and the End of Empire
Labour’s election defeat was prompted, in part, by the authorities’ failure
to remedy Britain’s external payments problems. The change in govern­
ment marked a turn towards the paramountcy of liberal doctrines, if not
yet practice, in economic policies. The period 1953–56 witnessed the par­
tial re-emergence of the traditional liberal British state albeit in a trans­
formed shape. Notably, this government was determined to reconcile
welfarism with the liberalization of payments and the fostering of the
international role of sterling. Ideological differences prompted changes in
the running of the welfare state, but did not compromise the essence of
welfarism and full employment. The Conservatives advocated a state that
refrained from direct intervention in the economy wherever possible,
though in practice physical controls were abandoned only gradually, and
demand management inspired by Keynesianism was adopted rather hesi­
tatingly. The return to convertibility was seen as imperative lest sterling’s
role as an important means of international exchange was jeopardized.
Intervention in market forces to control capital flows from the London
market was considered improper. Institutionally, the influence of the Bank
of England in its traditional role in managing sterling again became
strengthened. 2
None the less, the British economy was in only slightly better shape than
in the preceding period. Between 1953 and 1956, Britain achieved improve­
ments in domestic industrial production, but still encountered serious cur­
rent payments deficits. Structural sterling crises became transformed into
speculative ones in 1954–5 and again 1956–7; the dollar gap was closing
slowly. Moreover, once Britain had embarked on the road to convertibility,
there was no turning back. Policy was pushed by the forces inherent in
such a step. Delaying convertibility might increase the speculative pres­
sures on the pound, as was the case in the 1954–5 crisis. And once de facto
convertibility had been introduced in 1955, there was mounting pressure
for de jure convertibility. 3
From the reinvigorated liberal state in Britain ensued a particular set of
priorities with respect to the empire which differed from the previous
period. On top of that, the altered conditions set by the liberalizing state
provoked incompatibilities with established imperial economic relations.
The general implications for the empire lay primarily in the fields of ster­
ling area management, capital exports and colonial development.
Sterling area policy in view of convertibility required the reduction of
potential claims on Britain’s resources; at the same time, trade discrimina­
tion was still useful with respect to the empire to cushion balance of pay­
ments imbalances. But during liberalization the accumulation of colonial
sterling balances through discriminatory measures was inadvisable because
this strategy merely deferred claims on Britain; it did not reduce them. This
was an even more risky strategy in the mid-1950s because converti­
bility and trade discrimination were ultimately seen to be irreconcilable. 4Economic Liberalization, 1953–56 109
Therefore, whenever there was a sterling crisis during the liberalizing
period, it was the capital side of the balance of payments that had to be
controlled in the empire, not the current side that needed to be boosted.
This stood in sharp contrast to the discriminatory period.
Bound up with these requirements of liberalizing sterling relations was a
more systematic effort than previously to channel capital flows into areas
which were short of sterling. Accordingly, aid allocation became increas­
ingly selective and was no longer part of an overall development drive in
the empire. For example, if a territory had a long-term prospect of increas­
ing production but required heavy investment, Britain refused capital in
case this territory held a large amount of sterling. In sharp contrast to the
preceding period, colonial self-financing was expected to achieve a reduc­
tion in sterling holdings. As earlier, capital exports ought to yield an imme­
diate return, or otherwise stimulate growth in promising economies that
were short of sterling. However, after 1953 colonial development became
marginalized in this strategy of Britain’s external economic policy. 5 In addi­
tion, any pressures exerted on the London money market by colonial
demands for loans ought not to be at the expense of those overseas bor­
rowers that were deemed desirable pillars for sterling’s position in a liberal­
ized world economy in the future. This also implied that the state’s role as
a guarantor of credit arrangements would have to be reduced and ulti­
mately phased out. 6
The specific structural inconsistencies and conflicts that emerged between
the new priorities in Britain’s external economic relations and the legacy of
colonial economic arrangements lay in two main areas. First, the colonial
monetary mechanism favoured the accumulation of sterling balances under
conditions of discriminatory trade management and commodity price
booms. This was no longer a welcome property. None the less, dismantling
these arrangements was equally undesirable because this might enhance
pressures on Britain’s reserves and even encourage peripheral economies to
loosen their ties with sterling. Second, arrangements that helped to provide
development finance and capital flows to the colonies contradicted liberal
principles because they implied state intervention, which in turn distorted
market forces. 7
Therefore, the liberalizing state in Britain first went along with the main­
tenance of the status quo on the periphery. But then, in the mid-1950s,
liberalizing Britain’s external economic relations in trade and payments,
while preserving discriminatory and restrictive colonial economic policies
proved to be mutually exclusive goals. On the whole, Britain’s move
towards liberal trade and payments reduced her involvement with the
empire. Yet, this move was also hampered by the peculiar economic rela­
tionship with the empire which had developed since the beginning of the
twentieth century and had acquired a pronounced significance in the
period 1947–53. 8110 Money and the End of Empire
2. Liberalization and economic diplomacy
Besides the internal constraints, external influences affected Britain’s move
towards the convertibility of sterling and trade liberalization, and therefore
had an impact on her imperial relationships. Important constraints resulted
from negotiated long-term arrangements and principles of international
economic relations, notably the Bretton Woods agreements, and from eco­
nomic and diplomatic relations, especially with the United States, Europe
and the independent sterling Commonwealth. 9
During the period 1953–56, the United States was satisfied that Britain,
under Conservative leadership, would pursue liberal policy aims in her
own interest, and expected convertibility to be introduced in due course. 10
At the same time, the United States, owing to a recession in 1953–4, failed
to give full support to a rapid move towards the convertibility of sterling
by funding the sterling balances. 11 Ironically, the US government was less
keen to press multilateralism on the British at the moment when the Con­
servatives themselves advanced in this direction. Therefore, US pressure on
Britain for a solution to the problem of Britain’s overseas sterling balances
diminished. 12 As in the previous period, the British were basically free to
adopt whatever imperial policies they deemed necessary for balance of pay­
ments purposes as long as they sorted out the problems relating to the
accumulated sterling balances on their own. None the less, indirect pres­
sure on Britain mounted via the process of a continuous extension of eco­
nomic multilateralism which was evolving in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
Britain had to weigh the risks and extent of a convertibility operation
which she was able to sustain on her own. In that respect the stance of the
United States may have had some effect on prolonging discriminatory
management towards the empire. The British knew that the Americans
needed to be solicited further to provide finance, 13 and the British Treasury
accused the United States of lacking the required ‘good creditor policies’. 14
Therefore, Britain attempted to elicit more active support from the United
States with the so-called ‘collective approach’ and to coordinate a move
towards convertibility in international fora by obtaining the required safe­
guards. These negotiations did not promise rapid progress, and Britain was
driven towards convertibility by technical considerations in the European
context. 15
The problems of international economic reorganization, too, had indirect
repercussions on Britain’s relationship with the empire. These issues, among
other factors, had the potential of heightening British concerns about the
control of capital movements under various contingencies, and influenced
the speed with which Britain moved towards convertibility. The safeguards
Britain required in view of her persistent current payments imbalances per­
tained to the definition of convertibility on the one hand, and to the extentEconomic Liberalization, 1953–56 111
of permissible trade discrimination after the introduction of convertibility
on the other. Negotiations with the GATT and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) were important in so far as they affected the extent to which the
union of Britain and the empire might be used as a cushion during future
balance of payments crises, as had been the case in the period 1947–53. 16
Moreover, the legal definition of convertibility in the context of the IMF
might have an impact on the feasibility of stemming or anticipating colo­
nial capital claims on Britain. 17
With regard to convertibility and discrimination, Britain, in contrast to
the United States, was apprehensive of moving too radically or too quickly
towards anti-discrimination. The British feared that this might thwart their
ability to resort to some form of discrimination in a likely emergency.
Therefore, the time span was a matter of concern required in liberalizing
international payments for a move from article XIV of the IMF provisions,
which allowed discrimination, to article VIII of the provisions, which dis­
allowed direct discrimination. Equally, Britain accepted that quantitative
restrictions might have little future under convertibility and that
the GATT’s ‘No New Preference Rule’ could not be challenged. However,
officials hoped for some opt-out provisions in tariff matters to ease their
problems. In the event, it was not feasible to tighten trade rules to any sig­
nificant degree while introducing convertibility. Significantly, however,
while the GATT was strongly against preferential arrangements, it created
no obstacles to regional trading and monetary groups. GATT provisions,
even in the mid-1950s, continued to protect the use of Britain and the
empire as a single discriminatory entity. Moreover, it appeared that the
control of capital movements, while decontrolling current payments under
article VI of the IMF provisions, could be maintained in the long run. 18
But, whatever the legal interpretation, it would not remedy the harmful
political pressure the imperial periphery might ultimately bring to bear on
the sterling area framework by demanding releases or compensation for
accumulated sterling balances.
In relation to international economic reorganization Britain was, more­
over, subject to considerable pressure from the independent sterling
Commonwealth. The ensuing changes in mutual relations had a certain
knock-on effect on demands by colonial members of the sterling area. 19 The
independent sterling Commonwealth pushed Britain towards convertibility.
These countries, in fact, still held sterling to an extent they did not require.
Moreover, they became increasingly inclined to accumulate their own dollar
and gold reserves, thus counteracting the presumed ‘common interest’ of
the sterling area and undermining sterling’s international position. Both, in
turn, made it necessary for Britain to appease them. The issue had already
emerged during the discriminatory period. But now that British policy was
becoming more liberal, the sterling Commonwealth put its position more
forcefully; counter-arguments from Britain rang increasingly hollow. 20112 Money and the End of Empire
During 1956, the British government also became aware of a new trend in
international trade, away from the sterling area and towards trade between
industrialized countries. 21 Liberalization in Europe had repercussions on
Britain’s imperial relations because it implied that trade relations within
that area would become more important. The successful liberalization of
payments in conjunction with freer trade required the introduction of con­
vertibility in Europe in a coordinated way. This was precisely what the
European Payments Union was designed to do. 22 Since at least 1954 policy-
makers in London had realized that action by one country alone might cre­
ate unbearable pressure on Britain’s currency. Uncoordinated action might
precipitate the very breakdown of trade liberalization, as well as entailing
the failure of the desired move towards freer currencies. 23
More important, however, were plans for the creation of a European
customs union, proposed by continental countries (led by France and
Germany) at Messina in mid-1955. If implemented, the proposals threat­
ened to disturb Britain’s existing trade flows and the balancing mechanism
of external payments within the sterling area and beyond. 24 This prospect
had even more far-reaching implications for Britain and the empire than
the anticipated move to liberalization. The introduction of a customs union
would reorient Britain’s trade flows towards Europe on an even greater
scale. A customs union had the potential of virtually disrupting the sterling
area in its existing form – unless, of course, Britain refrained from joining.
The role of the colonies and the Commonwealth in Britain’s external eco­
nomic relations would thus be greatly diminished. Alternatively, if Britain
remained outside, a customs union on the European continent would
present a serious challenge to the competitiveness of British exports in
expanding markets.
3. The imperial policy of liberalization
The professed British aim of implementing multilateralism prompted a
shift in policy priorities. The new orientation is borne out by Britain’s app­
roach to convertibility, trade liberalization, capital exports and policies
towards the sterling area and sterling in general. The liberalization of exter­
nal economic relations significantly affected Britain’s crucial relationships
with the empire. Moreover, the established relationships themselves came
under scrutiny, and policy was readjusted.
The principal aim of both Conservative governments during the period
was to prepare liberalization in trade and to create the environment in
which the convertibility of sterling could be carried through successfully.
This objective had been widely publicized in relation to the Common­
wealth Economic Conference of 1952. 25 The Conservatives reaffirmed tra­
ditional ideas of liberal sterling policy inspired by prewar policies, but
sometimes fused them with wartime practices. 26Economic Liberalization, 1953–56 113
Britain eventually turned towards internal measures to ease balance of
payments problems and to stem inflation. A current balance of payments
surplus within a margin of £200 million to £500 million was deemed nec­
essary in order to meet the claims that resulted from liberalization. 27
Governments adopted mainly ‘monetary’ measures to achieve this aim,
though still supplemented by direct physical controls. When, in the mid­
1950s, it was realized that the liberalization of payments would eventually
be bound up with the liberalization of trade, governments gave even
stronger emphasis to ‘monetary’ management. Budget surpluses were to
be achieved from compulsory savings in industry and by the public. 28
Britain’s cheap money policy of the late 1940s, which had been continued
in the early 1950s, was replaced from 1953 by policies that made money
dearer. The basic lending rate, Bank Rate, rose from 4 per cent in 1952
to 6 per cent in 1955, and to 7 per cent in 1957. 29 Conservative govern­
ments adopted temporary import and almost permanent hire purchase
restrictions in order to protect the balance of payments. Observers charac­
terized government policy as ‘stop-go’ because of the frequent inter­
ruption of economic expansion during payments crises. Such measures
superseded earlier practices of inflationary control and balance of
payments cushioning via the sterling area. Systematic discrimination
was no longer available to the same degree, since it clashed with liberal
principles. 30
As an alternative, the British adopted safeguards to make convertibility
feasible. The transferable account area of sterling was only gradually broad-
ened. 31 The so-called ‘collective approach’ of the Commonwealth included
as its aim merely ‘non-resident’ convertibility. 32 At the same time, policy-
makers attempted to check the form and extent of trade liberalization.
Britain was determined to retain the option of quantitative restrictions
within the empire sanctioned by the ‘common quota’ clause, 33 when inter­
national fora discussed new world trade rules in early 1954. 34 Precautions
were also taken with regard to a move to article VIII of the IMF. The
Treasury thought that the move ought not to rule out the possibility of
using quantitative restrictions during balance of payments crises for two to
three years after the introduction of convertibility. 35 Otherwise, British pol­
icy moved away from the use of quantitative trade restrictions, which were
no longer seen to be expedient in a liberalizing world economy. Similarly,
trade preferences were doomed under multilateralism. Their introduction
in those parts of the empire, such as Africa, where they never had been
important anyway, was not considered to be an option. 36 What was called
for now was a coherent tariff policy, which the British hitherto had
lacked. 37 Eventually, moreover, trade liberalization in Europe became a
major concern in view of the competitiveness of British industry in crucial
markets. These concerns were borne out by Britain’s Free Trade Area pro­
posal of late 1956, known as ‘Plan G’. 38114 Money and the End of Empire
On the capital side, government policy gave precedence to capital
exports over a further increase in domestic investment. Manufacturing
output was promoted by commercial credit arrangements. Capital exports
were encouraged towards Canada and South American countries. Capital
flows to the independent sterling Commonwealth remained of the utmost
importance. And, British investors continued to show a strong propen­
sity towards these countries at the expense of the newly independent
Commonwealth. 39 At the same time, Britain discontinued financial agree­
ments on sterling releases, dating back to the 1947 sterling crisis, in areas
where the control of capital transactions was no longer required, namely
India, Pakistan and Ceylon. 40 Moreover, the British government attempted
to check the level of independent gold and dollar reserves held by indepen­
dent sterling area members. Such a diversification of reserves had become a
definite trend in the sterling Commonwealth, ‘old’ and ‘new’. 41
The inconvertibility of sterling continued to strain the allegiance to
Britain of the independent sterling Commonwealth in the mid-1950s.
Meanwhile, the main concerns of Britain’s imperial economic policy moved
away from the current and trade side towards the capital and banking side.
Policy focused on the colonial sterling balances, colonial development
finance and borrowing, in the first instance. Only later did the related issues
of colonial trade liberalization, colonial balance of payments and colonial
development policy become relevant.
With regard to the empire, discriminatory policy, notably in relation to
dollar import restrictions, was still strong. It was not until the mid-1950s
that the formal measures petered out. Colonial liberalization was cautiously
phased in in 1956, when imports were increased and colonial balance of
payments surpluses were reduced. 42 On the whole, policy became more
guarded in using the discriminatory potential of colonial balance of pay­
ments surpluses and emphasized defensive action on the capital side. This
action aimed at achieving a controlled reduction of the colonial sterling
balances, while at the same time reducing capital flows to the colonies. On
the one hand, British policy encouraged the colonies to draw on their
reserves. On the other, policy attempted to direct these withdrawals into
channels that were acceptable from the perspective of Britain’s move
towards liberalization, and to control their quantity.
The most important concrete measures designed to achieve these aims
were recommended by the 1953 Working Party on Colonial Sterling
Assets. 43 These recommendations included a shift in policy affecting cur­
rency board funds. As a result, in late 1954, the British government allowed
the implementation of a reduction of the previously full currency cover by
up to 20 per cent. This was, in effect, a measure to control colonial bal­
ances by shifting them to a more secure place rather than a measure to
reduce them, since the withdrawn margin was to be invested in local
securities in the colonies. For various reasons, this fiduciary issue wasEconomic Liberalization, 1953–56 115
rapidly implemented only in East Africa. Another measure affected the
West African marketing board funds. A small part of these funds could
equally be invested in local securities. The banking funds were also
affected. Up to one third of savings banks funds could be invested in local
securities. However, the practice of maintaining reserves equivalent to half
a year of a colony’s government income remained unchanged. Taxation,
too, remained at a very high level. 44 At the same time, the Crown Agents
were informed of the need to manage the liquidity of colonial investment
funds in such a way as to be able to meet the anticipated level of disinvest­
ment. However, they were allowed, under periodical review, to continue to
invest part of colonial funds in new colonial loan issues for other colonies
on the London market. 45
In order to control a reduction of the sterling balances by the colonies,
British policy also tightened borrowing and colonial development finance.
A linkage was made between the sterling balances and aid for the colonies,
be it in the form of loans from the London money market or assistance
within the framework of Colonial Development and Welfare (CD&W). 46
The aim of reducing demands for new finance and the use of reserves
prompted a review of existing development plans. 47 Colonial borrowing
from the London money market was sharply reduced. The major holders of
colonial balances were not allowed to float new loans, and received little or
no CD&W assistance. Other projects were to be financed from alternative
sources, such as loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD). Moreover, policy now showed more flexibility to­
wards direct investment in the colonies by the United States. 48 In contrast
to the Labour period, colonial development policy shied away from active
involvement in development projects, focusing instead on their financial
evaluation and administration.
In spite of these measures, the Treasury and the Bank expected in mid­
1956 that considerable new pressures on Britain’s reserves would arise from
the colonial sterling balances. 49 From 1956, the policies that had been
aimed at adjusting Britain’s economic relations with the empire came
under renewed review. 50
4. The rationale of imperial adjustment
Britain’s priorities moved towards the internationalization of sterling and
from a sterling area that operated under discriminatory assumptions of
international economic relations to one that operated under economic
multilateralism. Consequently, the rationale of Britain’s external economic
policy changed. Moreover, this shift bears out how imperial policy was
embedded within the context of wider British policy designs.
The restoration of sterling into a liberal world economy required that
confidence in the pound had to be boosted. This applied to relations within116 Money and the End of Empire
as well as beyond the sterling area. Ideally, Britain had to be able to with­
stand potential pressures on her currency from the capital side as well as
from a possible reduction of trade barriers. Improving confidence implied,
in the simplest terms, that holding sterling must be voluntary and in the
interest of the holders rather than ‘forced’. Therefore, sterling transfers by
holders of sterling balances had to be facilitated. This, however, was fraught
with difficulty, not least because the British economy could, in reality, nei­
ther meet the ensuing claims nor cope with their inflationary potential. 51
Moreover, capital exports towards areas that were short of sterling had to
be given priority in order to stimulate export-led growth. Areas that were
rich in sterling were now the most suitable outlets for British exports in
terms of sterling requirements. 52 By contrast, capital exports towards these
areas had to be cut down, since they increased the pressure on Britain’s
resources. Previously, policy had paid little attention to the fact that capital
flows towards areas rich in sterling also increased future claims on Britain.
Such capital exports, if they could be spared, were considered a worthwhile
investment for sterling area purposes. However, the Conservatives, unlike
Labour, had no faith in the development of the colonies as a pivot of the
sterling area. 53
None the less, British officials continued to believe that future financial
and trade policies ought to keep the construction of a viable sterling area
in mind. 54 The sterling area had to regain its ability to coordinate domestic
economic policies in situations of crisis in order to protect sterling’s inter­
national role. For the same reason, the independent sterling area had to be
motivated to make use of the London money market and to continue to
hold the bulk of its currency reserves in sterling. In the independent ster­
ling Commonwealth, trade liberalization in general was well advanced.
The British also saw convertibility as a necessity to maintain the coherence
of the sterling area.
Boosting the economic performance of the dependent sterling area was
not the main British concern in the period 1953–56. Rather, colonial ster­
ling holdings had to be reduced while at the same time preventing the
basic economic relationships from disintegrating. In striking contrast to
the period 1947–53, Britain’s external economic policies were hindered
rather than furthered by the legacy of her policy towards the empire.
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, British policy had generally accepted
that the accumulation of colonial sterling balances would not be a source
of pressure on Britain’s resources. The first committees to examine the fea­
sibility of the convertibility of sterling shared this assumption. 55 However,
by 1954 this perception had changed markedly. British policy-makers
rediscovered that the colonial sterling balances might constitute an unwel­
come obstacle on the way towards the smooth introduction of convertibil-
ity. 56 This concern was intensified by the realization that the colonial
sterling balances by that time had become the most important part of totalEconomic Liberalization, 1953–56 117
overseas balances. 57 With respect to capital movements to the dollar area
and the need for exchange controls, the risk lay with the sterling area and
the ‘resident’ holders of sterling. 58 Compliance with the rationale of exter­
nal economic policy meant that these aims had to be achieved in parallel:
the reduction of balances, the reduction of capital flows to the colonies
(especially loans and grants), and the conservation of important discri­
minatory trade measures in the colonies. These objectives were not com­
pletely reconcilable. 59
Policy choices have to be understood from the perspective of policy pre­
sumptions and perceptions. First, policy-makers saw colonial grants and loans
as an important factor preventing them from keeping a check on the colo­
nial sterling balances. Apart from this, it was thought that the market for
colonial loans would deteriorate. 60 Second, British policy was careful not to
provoke the disintegration of existing economic relationships with the
colonies. A disruption of the colonial monetary mechanism might increase
the pressure on British resources unduly; it might also be tantamount to
abandoning the close colonial link with sterling and the British economy
altogether. Finally, during this period British policy-makers largely assumed
that politicians in the colonies would not see it in their self-interest to ques­
tion these basic links, even if they were prone to being misguided. 61
According to a widespread and genuine misapprehension among policy-
makers in the early 1950s, the colonial sterling balances were largely the
result of capital inflows. 62 Another misconception, though less widespread,
was that the colonial balances were merely the result of commodity price
booms and, therefore, had nothing to do with British policy and the run­
ning of colonial economic institutions. Claims on accumulated balances
would increase as boom prices vanished, and the level of accumulated bal­
ances would then unavoidably fall. A reduction of capital flows to the
colonies would also bring a reduction in the level of the balances. These
misapprehensions explain in part why the remedies attempted in 1953 had
still not produced the required cure by 1956. The measures designed to pro­
mote alternatives to London aid and borrowing, notably the modest reduc­
tion of the currency cover and increased self-financing, correlate with a
reduction of London market loans to colonies that were rich in sterling.
However, expectations of a reduction in the colonial balances were dashed. 63
Even when taking the issue of reducing capital flows to the colonies in
isolation from the problem of the balances, the sums involved must be put
in perspective. They were relatively small compared to the volume of capital
that went to other parts of the world. 64 Moreover, it was in principle desir­
able that overseas countries used London as their capital market.
Far more important were British policy doctrine and priorities. Sufficient
capital would not flow to the empire as a result of market forces. The
high Bank Rate, which inhibited overseas borrowing, was not the only or
even the main reason why the colonies received less capital from loans.118 Money and the End of Empire
Rather, support by the state for colonial borrowing contradicted liberal eco­
nomic principles and obstructed the empire’s adjustment to a liberal inter­
national economic order. Only about a half of all colonial loans were
subscribed for by the general public; the other half were in fact inter-colo-
nial investment via the Crown Agents. This flow heightened concerns about
long-term development finance for the colonies under liberalized condi-
tions. 65 By contrast, capital exports to other areas, namely the Americas, ful­
filled a more useful role for the preparation of Britain’s move towards
convertibility and liberalization. Such investment would rekindle or
strengthen British financial and trading interests where it mattered more.
The whole issue of the colonial balances and capital flows was of little
concern as long as there existed a convergence of interest among British
government departments that the balances were useful or unavoidable,
and as long as nobody seriously questioned the long-term implications.
Yet, in view of convertibility and trade liberalization, an anticipation of
sudden claims on Britain’s resources was warranted. In reality, a reduction
of the balances rather than a mere reduction in the rate of their accumula­
tion would have required a balance of payments deficit, and also a consid­
erable degree of dollar liberalization. A reduction would have required
some radical structural and policy changes, such as import liberalization, a
less austere management of government funds and marketing board funds,
and a larger reduction in the currency cover. Such changes challenged
important features of colonial economic policies and institutions and bore
risks which, at that time, policy-makers were not prepared to take.
The assumption on which policy was based until 1956 was that colonial
economic arrangements would on the whole remain intact. Therefore,
claims on Britain that needed to be taken into consideration were largely
those that would emerge from the balances that could be withdrawn with­
out changing the existing arrangements in any important way. None the
less, the British saw a decrease in the level of the balances as highly desir­
able. A reduction in balances, though in itself constituting a claim on
British resources, might also reduce the pressure on the London market in
the long run. This reduction of claims on Britain was important, if confi­
dence in sterling was to be promoted. Moreover, a reduction of the colonial
sterling balances might also support Britain’s export trade when used as a
counter-cyclical measure during a recession in the United States. 66
However, this was at best a temporary outlet: the remaining colonial mar­
kets were not those Britain needed to remain competitive in the long run,
and to guarantee full employment. Policy-makers hardly listened to lobby­
ists who reappeared from among the ‘old’ imperialists during the Conser­
vative period of the 1950s, and who demanded colonial preferences to be
introduced or increased. These pressures were not only completely against
the grain of the pursued sterling policy, but also hardly feasible with
regard to economic multilateralism. 67 British policy-makers were aware ofEconomic Liberalization, 1953–56 119
the growing importance of the trend in Britain’s current trade relations
towards European markets. They were equally adamant about overcoming
obstacles which the internationalization of sterling encountered on the
capital and banking side.
This double concern is well demonstrated by the idiosyncratic way in
which Britain responded to the initiative for a European customs union in
1956. The British Free Trade Area proposal was designed to neutralize the
potential damage to Britain of European integration, and to regain a mea­
sure of lost initiative. 68 For imperial relations the more specific implica­
tions were that joining a customs union would upset existing trade and
payments arrangements within the sterling area, since, by definition, this
amounted to a common external tariff. A free trade area retained tariffs for
individual members. This meant that sterling area arrangements were in
principle left unimpaired, provided that the empire and Commonwealth
were excluded. Moreover, by focusing on manufactures British export inter­
ests would be boosted on the continent of Europe. At the same time, by
excluding agricultural produce, policy averted the drawbacks of having to
cope with inflows of European agricultural produce at the expense of pro­
duce originating in the sterling area. This preservation of imperial trade
and payments arrangements was important in view of the prospective ster­
ling convertibility operation and any payments crisis that might emerge.
Moreover, these arrangements helped members of the ‘old’ Commonwealth
to balance Britain’s invisible surplus with them. If the colonies themselves
became part of the Free Trade Area, their trade could become reoriented
towards the European continent. This might affect the existing trade and
payments arrangements at Britain’s expense.
On the whole, the problem of reconciling potentially conflicting inter­
ests within the British polity – representing finance, manufactures, and trade
– became more acute during the liberalizing period. The chosen course of
policy was the result to an important extent, of inter-departmental discus­
sions reflecting divisions within the British state.
5. The British polity and imperial liberalization
A striking feature of the period 1953–56, in contrast to the preceding dis­
criminatory period, was the breakup of the ‘common cause’ of British pol-
icy. 69 There had been a unanimity of purpose rather than of doctrines or
objectives; the adjustment to economic multilateralism brought forces of
division within the British polity to the fore. These divisions resulted from
the requirements liberalization imposed on the established functions of
government departments on the one hand, and from wider societal influ­
ences on the other.
The Bank of England resumed its traditional role as the patron of
Britain’s sterling policy. The Bank, since the mid-1950s, had been a keen120 Money and the End of Empire
advocate of a rapid return to the convertibility of sterling. 70 While the
Bank considered it necessary to obtain a number of discriminatory safe­
guards, British policy must not be seen to be too hesitant lest confidence in
sterling deteriorated and Britain’s financial and trading interests were irre­
versibly harmed. The Bank was concerned that the Treasury might take too
strict a line on retaining discriminatory options for purposes of interna­
tional bargaining; the Bank wished to limit the options to severe balance of
payments crises. 71 Therefore, the Bank’s chief aim was to regulate the capi­
tal market and capital flows, and to readjust them to sterling’s needs under
conditions of economic multilateralism. To achieve this, colonial borrow­
ing and claims posed by the colonial sterling balances had to be settled.
The Bank’s interest in the empire did not extend beyond matters related to
these concerns. 72
In 1953, the Bank advocated the greater use of colonial reserves for colo­
nial development rather than new borrowing from the London money
market. 73 The Bank was satisfied with a solution that authorized fiduciary
issues as a means of releasing some sterling from the currency funds. The
Bank saw this as a positive step, not least because in some colonies the
Bank did not think that it was possible to maintain the full currency cover
in the long run. At the same time, the measure contained a safety valve
because the amount of the reduction was to be invested in local securities.
This, moreover, reduced claims for borrowing from the London money
market and created the first step towards local money markets. 74
By 1955–6, concerns within the Bank on the continuing high level of the
colonial balances had resurfaced and had become more urgent. Towards the
end of 1955, the Bank insisted on discussions with the Treasury on required
changes in sterling area policy, as it had done in 1952. 75 The Bank’s internal
debate, in 1956, reveals that officials had few illusions that the colonial ster­
ling balances had increased essentially as the result of import controls, dol­
lar ceilings and marketing board policies. According to the Governor,
Britain’s gold and dollar reserves would be in ‘queer street’ had it not been
for the contribution of the overseas sterling area. 76 But under changed cir­
cumstances sterling would be weakened by such ‘forced’ holdings of ster­
ling. Concern with the balances prompted the Bank also to question the
government’s general fiscal and monetary policy, since a high Bank Rate
had a bearing on the interest paid on the vast amount of balances. 77
In 1956, too, the Bank was demanding stronger measures with regard to
colonial borrowing. This issue was again of primary concern for the Bank
both in its own right and to prevent demands for loans from the
Exchequer arising as an alternative to loans from the market. Moreover,
certain established investment practices, according to the Bank, made dis­
investment potentially hazardous. The Crown Agents now came under fire
for intervening in the market for colonial loans through inter-colonial
investment. 78 The Bank, in private, even held the view that there were noEconomic Liberalization, 1953–56 121
remedies to improve the prospects for colonial borrowing. The Bank saw
measures such as the trustee arrangements, which traditionally channelled
investment from British institutions (trustees) into colonial stock, as out­
moded and unsuited to the new multilateralism. 79
The Treasury’s policy concerns were in many ways similar to those of the
Bank, though there were differences in emphasis. The Treasury was also
keen to restore sterling to convertibility. However, after the discouraging
experience with the ROBOT scheme in 1952, it was more sceptical than the
Bank that this could be achieved in the short term without the United
States being much more forthcoming with financial support. The Treasury,
therefore, opted for a more gradual domestic and international strategy. 80
Unlike the Bank, the Treasury was particularly concerned with the wider
economic, not merely the financial, aspects of the colonial sterling
balances in view of discussions on how best to achieve the desired British
balance of payments surplus. Therefore, in 1953–4 it took a keen interest
in the counter-cyclical role colonial balances could play in supporting
employment in Britain during a recession in the United States. In sharp
contrast to the previous period, this interest even prompted the Treasury
to advocate the running of colonial balance of payments deficits under
such conditions in order to reduce claims on Britain. 81 However, this was
by no means advocated as a measure that ought to be used to reduce the
sterling balances under prosperous economic conditions.
None the less, the Treasury’s Overseas Finance Division in particular
increasingly worried about the colonial sterling balances. This was so not
only because of problems with colonial borrowing but because of claims
that were likely to arise from colonial dollar liberalization and might imperil
a smooth move towards convertibility. 82 However, the Treasury believed at
the same time that the 1953 recommendations constituted a valid basis of
policy, and pushed ahead with implementing them. 83 In marked contrast to
the Bank, the Treasury’s Overseas Finance Division held the view that ‘non­
resident’ convertibility was a secure option, which allowed the existing
pooling procedures in the sterling area to remain operational. 84 At the same
time, in 1956 the Treasury, more than the Bank, still believed in the feasibil­
ity of very gradual changes in colonial monetary arrangements.
With respect to colonial borrowing, the Treasury, like the Bank, wished
to step up capital exports as compared to domestic investment. Moreover,
both aimed at redirecting capital flows away from the colonies towards
other areas by reducing the soaring colonial claims for loans. 85 The
Treasury’s Imperial Finance Division maintained that CD&W allocations
ought to depend on the prior use of available sterling balances. 86 The
Division urged the Colonial Office to allow the colonies to dig deeper into
their reserves and current earnings to finance development. 87 In 1956, in
conjunction with the Bank, the Treasury insisted that further changes
in colonial loan finance be made, and that even more self-financing122 Money and the End of Empire
be promoted. Exchequer loans were no alternative. Moreover, the Crown
Agent’s practices would need to be addressed urgently. 88
Much greater discrepancies existed between these views and those held
within the Colonial Office. While the Bank was little concerned with
Britain’s imperial link in its own right, the Colonial Office showed little
concern about the broader requirements for sterling policy. The Colonial
Office still set out from the assumption that there were no large free ster­
ling balances, and no balances that should be freed. From the Colonial
Office’s perspective, the high level of the sterling balances reflected the
very success of Britain’s colonial development policy and of British aid. The
funds within which the balances accumulated must be left untouched,
with the exception of the development reserve funds. Fully covered cur­
rency funds were required to maintain the confidence of expatriate firms
in colonial currencies. The marketing board funds served as a buffer against
price fluctuation; government funds and high taxation were an additional
buffer against colonial inflation. The Office mainly expressed concern in
relation to the protection of the export trade in primary commodities and
certain infrastructural projects related to it. This approach defended a par­
ticular relationship of the colonies with Britain, except that the purpose
the Office championed no longer existed in the same way during Britain’s
move towards economic liberalization. 89
Britain’s novel external economic policy flatly contradicted all that had
been orthodox since at least 1939, and much of what the Colonial Office
had assimilated about ‘sound’ finance and promoted as an educational
ideal. Moreover, it was difficult to embark upon a course that smacked of a
new marginalization of the colonies. In essence, the Colonial Office hardly
represented the colonial development view as opposed to the view of
British external economic policy. Rather, the Office exhibited a genuine
lack of understanding of the macroeconomic issues involved and concen­
trated on the preservation of the colonies’ traditional role for Britain. It
would be mistaken to accredit the Office with any particularly shrewd and
sophisticated development strategy to press for more development finance,
or conversely imply that it was intent on exploiting the colonies. 90 The
Colonial Office advocated much more cautious policies than did the
Treasury and the Bank, which wished to disentangle wider external eco­
nomic policy from possible impediments presented by imperial relation­
ships. For the Colonial Office, economic liberalization under prevalent
political circumstances in the colonies meant that it was imperative that
existing monetary arrangements were not tampered with. Liberalization
and convertibility would be too much of a temptation for colonial govern­
ments to embark on massive import policies. Any possible lack of disci­
pline must be pre-empted. 91 These strict views not only meant a drifting
apart of the Office’s position on the one hand, and that of the Treasury and
Bank on the other, but also an increasing discord with administrators ofEconomic Liberalization, 1953–56 123
colonial states. 92 This mattered in so far as agreed policy measures were not
pursued as expeditiously as the Treasury and Bank would have wished.
Only the continuously increasing urgency of obtaining finance for colo­
nial development from 1953, together with influence from the Bank and
pressure from the Treasury and the colonies themselves, prompted the
Colonial Office somewhat to shift from its inflexible position. For example,
the size of the fiduciary issue was assessed with colonial governments.
Some urgency was prompted by the possible implications of this issue to
the allocations that would be pledged in the new CD&W Act in 1955.
However, the Colonial Office circular of September 1954 merely mentioned
the possibility of introducing a conservative fiduciary element of about 20
per cent or less, or none at all, according to local conditions. 93 Moreover,
the Colonial Office continued to argue that there was little scope for draw­
ing on the colonial sterling balances instead of engaging in new borrowing
because of the purpose of the sterling funds and their territorial distribu-
tion. 94 On the whole, the Colonial Office remained lukewarm with regard
to policy changes, and it is revealing that the Office took care that discus­
sions were led between its officials and colonial governors with the explicit
aim of circumventing unofficial members in executive councils. 95
Put crudely, the differences between the Treasury, the Bank and the Colo­
nial Office were mainly related to the management of sterling and sterling
area requirements, whereas the position of the Board of Trade reflects wider
divisions within the British polity linked to different policy preferences of
finance and manufacturing. British industry would rather have preferred
that convertibility was either not introduced at all or considerably deferred. 96
The Board of Trade feared that convertibility would mean immediate non­
discrimination, notably against dollar goods. An isolated move by Britain
would mean increased competition for British industry from foreign
imports. Even more worryingly, such a step might also mean discrimina­
tory action from continental Europe, thus hitting British exports to
European markets. Therefore, intra-European coordination was of the
utmost importance. 97 However, the move towards convertibility was not
influenced by these considerations, but largely determined by concerns of
the Bank and the Treasury. 98
None the less, some of the Board’s views found their way into policy in as
much as they needed to be incorporated to make economic liberalization fea­
sible. For example, Britain advanced her Free Trade Area proposal because she
felt the necessity of pre-empting undue strain on the convertibility operation
or even unleashing the disruption of liberalization. This need was recognized
at least since 1954, and thus was no mere reaction to European develop-
ments. 99 During the period 1953–56, therefore, changes in British imperial
policy also reflected the mounting necessity of attuning potentially divisive
interests of competitive manufacturing with mainstream sterling policy,
given that inter-industrial trade was becoming increasingly important.124 Money and the End of Empire
6. Conclusion
Close economic interrelations existed between Britain and her empire in the
late 1940s and early 1950s. In the period 1953–56, this relationship began
to drift apart. This chapter has developed an argument about the implica­
tions of Britain’s liberalizing external economic relations for her imperial
relations. Policy-makers began to re-examine the feasibility of liberalization
broken off nearly one decade earlier. Now, however, they were confronted
with a problem writ large. Compared to the previous period, the reliance on
colonial trade surpluses was no longer an easy option during balance of
payments crises. Largely as the result of previous discriminatory policies,
these surpluses had become a serious source of concern by 1953 because the
level of colonial sterling balances had sharply increased. In view of the lib­
eralization of trade and payments, a way had to be found of reducing these
balances. At the same time, the impact of the reduction on a still weak
British economy had to be controlled. The colonial sterling balances
became an issue, not least because their withdrawal had an important polit­
ical, not only an economic, dimension. This aspect has been omitted in
recent research on the sterling area. The move towards liberal economic
multilateralism, together with economic expansion on the periphery, car­
ried the risk of an uncontrolled withdrawal of balances and undermined the
functioning of Britain’s established economic ties with the empire.
Therefore, British policy was cautious in modifying imperial economic rela­
tionships. However, Britain created opportunities to reduce some of the
accumulated colonial sterling balances, notably by introducing a fiduciary
issue and by other measures. Changing priorities for capital exports also
prompted the government to check flows to areas that were rich in sterling,
such as the colonies, in a more rigorous manner. None the less, policy-
makers wished to retain some discriminatory option which would allow
them to rely on the empire during balance of payments crises. The present
account has shown that the Bank of England and the Treasury dominated
the debates on imperial policy and largely surpassed any influence exerted
by the Colonial Office and the Board of Trade. The precise scope for
Britain’s manoeuvring in reconciling the needs of liberalizing sterling rela­
tions with established imperial policies depended not least on conditions
on the periphery. The next chapter will discuss these aspects.

The 1953 Working Party on the sterling balances had focused on overall aggre­
gates of funds, on the possible strain on the London money market from the bal­
ances and from new borrowing, and on a general assessment of the liquidity of
colonial investment. As a result of the 1953 exercise, and particularly the ‘Littler
exercise’ in 1955–6, British policy-makers gradually became aware of the levels of
certain funds, notably general government reserves, and of regional distributions.
Ultimately, this assessment was related to subsequent evaluations of the risk of the
withdrawal of the balances, their availability for development, and their liquidity
(see A.7.1 and A.9.1). However, it is important to realize that actual withdrawals
also responded to a political logic. While the quantity of Nigerian holdings and
risk-prone funds was higher, it was the Gold Coast that caused more concern among
policy-makers because of the greater degree of political pressure being exerted there.
For an introduction and survey of the trends and technicalities of the sterling
balances and their distribution in different funds and across different regions, see
chapter 3.
Table A.6.2 is one of many documents listing Colonial Office demands for loans
required for colonial development by individual territories. The data cover those
three years of the period 1939–58 during which the market was the most receptive to
new colonial issues. The list compares the loan requirements with the expected use of
local resources for development.
The figures show that planned self-financing was considerable. However, the
Colonial Office’s demands hardly affected decisions by the Treasury and Bank of
England. As a result, the self-financing of colonial development, which the Treasury
and Bank of England preferred over lending, was ultimately even higher than the
Colonial Office anticipated (see also A.8.2). A comparison with actual loans issued
suggests that the Colonial Office assessed the demand for loans with little regard to
their prospects of realization. For example, the Colonial Office included a demand
for a loan of £20 million for the Gold Coast (for 1952–55), a territory which was not
allowed to float a single loan during the entire 1947–58 period. This was so because
Britain wished to maximize the Gold Coast’s position as a net contributor to the
sterling area. However, demands for loans were met with respect to Kenya and the
East African High Commission (EAHC).

The Colonies, Politics and Economic
Development: Britain’s Liberalization
Challenged, 1953–56
Britain’s liberalization in external economic relations in the mid-1950s
required policies that made the dismantling of trade restrictions and cur­
rency convertibility feasible without provoking instability. Britain was urged
along the road towards liberalization by external factors, namely her rap­
prochement with Europe and the longstanding relationship with the United
States. However, the local economic and social environment in the colonies
was not conducive to Britain’s liberalization in her external economic rela­
tions. The colonies might push Britain to travel too fast towards liberaliza­
tion or be too slow in adjusting to it, or their intention to conduct
expansionist economic policies might altogether sidestep British coordina­
tion in a liberalized sterling area. Moreover, institutional transformations in
the colonies might heighten risks for the sterling area ensuing from the ster­
ling balances. British colonial policy was influenced by perceptions of such
risks, and attempted to steer clear of these constraints by evaluating their
political dimension. The Gold Coast is the most relevant example for this
strategy. The wider rationale of colonial economic policies emanated from
Britain’s reorientation in external economic relations. Political studies of the
period abound. But the literature dealing with economic developments on
the periphery is still relatively scarce compared to later periods. Moreover,
studies of economic policy largely ignore the imperial context in which pol­
icy was formulated. The political dimension of these issues will be better
understood if they are viewed as part of the wider sterling relationships of
liberalizing Britain. 1
1. Colonial economies in a changing environment
Between 1953 and 1956, the environment of the international economy
and economic organization affected Britain’s management of the imperial
sterling area in a different way from the preceding period. At the same time,
128The Colonies, Politics and Economic Development 129
the requirements for British policy became markedly altered as a result of
Britain’s move towards economic liberalization. Meanwhile, independent
academic opinion on peripheral economic development emerged, challeng­
ing the received views on colonial development.
During the period, the performance of the export sector of the most
important colonial economies, namely Malaya, the Gold Coast and Nigeria,
showed the following trends. Malayan rubber and sterling area minerals
experienced a fall in price. However, this fall did not induce a persistent
balance of payments deficit in Malaya, even if its balance noticeably wors­
ened in comparison with the boom period at the beginning of the Korean
War. West African cocoa developed in the opposite direction. In fact, the
cocoa price reached its highest point since 1945 in the 1954–5 season.
Consequently, colonial income from cocoa exports, for the Gold Coast in
particular, was even higher than it had been during the previous period,
and the potential for dollar earning and the accumulation of sterling bal­
ances was enhanced. It was for this very reason that such booms had given
a welcome boost to Britain’s balance of payments during the discriminatory
management of imperial economies. However, by the mid-1950s Britain
had abandoned discriminatory policies as a long-term strategy. 2
During Britain’s move towards greater liberalization in trade and pay­
ments, boom prices for colonial export commodities were a double-edged
sword. On the one hand, any rapid deterioration in the price of colonial
commodities constituted a potential burden for the self-financing of colonial
development. In addition, a fall in price might jeopardize the cushion the
empire was still able to provide for Britain’s balance of payments crises. On
the other hand, in sharp contrast to the discriminatory period, British pol-
icy-makers loathed excessive commodity price booms, since these entailed a
further rise in the colonial sterling balances. 3 The ability to reduce these bal­
ances was effectively under control due to the nature of the colonial mone­
tary arrangements which tended to support their accumulation, and because
of colonial economic policies regarding the marketing boards and the gov­
ernment reserve funds. However, this also meant that a reduction of the bal­
ances was difficult to achieve without modifying these arrangements. Yet,
such modifications, in turn, might add to the very risks of a rundown of the
balances and trigger expansionist economic policies in the colonies. This
constellation posed a dilemma for British officials. The situation was critical
with respect to the Gold Coast, and largely accounts for the crucial place this
territory occupied in British policy in the mid-1950s. 4
International provisions that earlier had permitted Britain to operate dis­
criminatory management with respect to the empire by relying heavily on
‘unrequited’ exports remained valid between 1953 and 1956. None the less,
pressures ensued from developments in international economic organiza­
tion that struck at the core of established colonial economic arrangements.
Britain’s aim to direct colonial demands for loans away from the London130 Money and the End of Empire
money market made it appropriate to solicit funds from supranational bod­
ies, such as the IBRD. This ought to have provided alternative finance for
projects of colonial and sterling area development as long as these schemes
helped in substituting imports from outside the area or boosted sustain­
able exports to other regions. 5 Yet, as it turned out, such finance also
meant that Britain’s running of colonial economies came under scrutiny
from a body that could not easily be influenced by British government
departments or the Bank of England.
The IBRD’s principal concern was to assess whether its loans were expedi­
ent, and to secure the creditworthiness of its borrowers. Accordingly, the
Bank’s survey missions often touched upon the suitability of colonial eco­
nomic and monetary arrangements. 6 Central features of these arrangements
suffered criticism. These included the currency cover and the quasi-exclusive
currency reserves in sterling, as well as the perceived neglect of monetary
management in colonial economic policies. The level of the sterling bal­
ances also came under scrutiny for its possible use in development
finance. 7 This went far beyond the priority that had been established by
British government departments of seeking a reduction of the sterling bal­
ances before allocating new development loans. 8 IBRD recommendations,
it seems, embraced a role for central banking in colonial territories that
conflicted with Britain’s desire to preserve a sterling area closely affiliated to
the British economy in monetary and financial matters. 9
Two other sources potentially undermined Britain’s established economic
arrangements in the colonies in a similar way. The IBRD cannot be credited
with advocating development policies, but rather with securing measures
in tune with debt collection. 10 However, independent academic opinion
and the novel discipline of development economics began to influence
thinking in and about peripheral states during this period. Representatives
of the emerging discipline criticized the IBRD for giving inadequate regard
to development and also attacked certain aspects of Britain’s colonial eco­
nomic policies, namely the import restrictions imposed upon prospering
export-oriented economies. They also advocated a more active role for cen­
tral banks in development activities. 11 Central banks had already become
involved in development elsewhere in the former empire, such as the
Reserve Bank of India’s in agricultural and industrial credit operations,
though admittedly in a rather different economic environment from the
British colonies. 12 Many of these influences were still very tentative during
the period. However, the mere discussion of such issues opened the door
for considerations of possible alternative economic policies, and often
raised expectations in that respect by affecting colonial political opinion. 13
Another growing influence that undermined Britain’s economic arrange­
ments in the colonies were the American business lobbies. American entre­
preneurs and, so the British alleged, the US government as well, encouraged
governments on the periphery to foster trade with the dollar area, holdThe Colonies, Politics and Economic Development 131
reserves in dollars and use New York as their capital market. 14 Ceylon is a
good example of such developments. 15 These changes, if they materialized,
threatened the existing sterling area arrangements and thus the centrepiece
of Britain’s external economic strategy at the time. This problem was com­
pounded by the fact that Britain needed external finance (which meant dol­
lars) for sterling area development in order to compete successfully in the
multilateral world to which she aspired.
2. Colonial socio-economic conditions and British
liberalization
Britain’s move towards the convertibility of sterling and trade liberalization
had the potential of heightening pressures on British resources from claims
of withdrawals of sterling balances and the likely increase of imports from
the dollar area. Some socio-economic constellations in the key colonies
eased Britain’s move towards liberalization while others impeded it. Libera­
lization also modified Britain’s requirements in terms of the structure of
economies on the periphery.
Under liberalization, a deliberate accumulation of ‘excess’ sterling bal­
ances was not a desirable option. The liberalizing sterling area required the
colonies to spend their accumulated funds without undermining the con­
trol function of colonial economic institutions and producing undue infla­
tionary pressures at a time when only a limited degree of imports for dollars
was acceptable. 16 Boosting colonial export performance by securing regular
supplies of colonial produce became less important for Britain than moni­
toring the use of accumulated surpluses. This was a burden Britain owed, at
least in part, to earlier discriminatory policies in the empire. Britain was par­
ticularly concerned about the huge colonial sterling balances of Malaya, the
Gold Coast and Nigeria, whereas no undue further claims were expected to
come from the independent sterling area, which had already liberalized
trade to a considerable degree. 17 The reduction of sterling balances was
potentially more difficult in certain areas than in others and was compli­
cated by the purpose of the individual funds in which they were held. For
example, the reduction of marketing board funds might compromise the
purpose for which, officially, they had been accumulated. Moreover, it
would involve a tricky process of negotiation with representatives of local
producers, especially in West Africa. However, in other territories, such as
Malaya, the control of the balances was facilitated by the fact that export
earnings were decreasing. 18
In its liberalizing phase, imperial policy required an economic structure
that was more diversified and less export-oriented than it had been during
the period of discriminatory management, while basically retaining the
same trade orientation. In this way, volatile colonial export earnings would
not put undue pressure on the payments arrangements of the sterling area132 Money and the End of Empire
as a whole. Moreover, it was desirable to promote economies with more
developed financial markets than existed in most colonies. Creating such
conditions would result in more of the surpluses remaining in the periph­
eral economy, thus reducing the demands for loans on the London market.
Inflationary pressures would not be directly transferred to Britain because
of the growth of the domestic sectors of peripheral economies. This was
the ideal; it was, however, not readily available. 19
The smooth adjustment of the capital side of the empire’s balance of
payments hinged on social and political pressures within the colonies. On
the face of it, Britain’s move towards liberalization conveyed the impres­
sion that the government was preparing to ease the colonial predicament
of the discriminatory period. Imports from the dollar area would increase
in the long run. Current earnings might become convertible at a future
date. Furthermore, colonial governments could present cosmetic changes,
such as the introduction of central banks, as measures of economic liberal­
ization and financial devolution. Thus, it might appear that local opinion
could be appeased more easily. In reality, new social and political con­
straints developed and old ones increased. The relaxation (albeit gradual)
of import controls on consumer goods was welcome among the urban pop­
ulation. However, to be successful, British policy also needed to block aspi­
rations commonly associated with liberalization, such as large-scale capital
transfers towards hard currency areas. 20 The periphery had to be prevented
from moving towards the dollar for trading and reserve purposes.
In the Gold Coast, pressures for a move towards using the dollar con­
tinued to rise, not least prompted by dollar restrictions in the past. 21
Moreover, pressures further increased from cocoa producers who became
potentially powerful allies of the export-oriented indigenous business sec­
tor. This group had posed problems for Britain during the discriminatory
period because of its grievances about inadequate credit facilities for which
they put the blame on sterling area policies, wanting development policies
and colonial monetary institutions. 22 In Nigeria, the situation seems to
have differed because the relevant economic forces were politically aligned
with regional interest groups. This led to a certain lethargy about economic
development in the bureaucracy, and to the impression that financial
resources were adequate to meet required development needs. 23
In Malaya, unlike the Gold Coast, there was relatively little conflict
between the ambitions of local entrepreneurs and Britain’s sterling area
policies. However, during the 1950s a new trend became apparent in Malay
rubber growing that was to characterize developments in the 1960s and
1970s. Smallholdings were undergoing a gradual transformation towards
commercial entrepreneurship and increased in size. Emerging entrepreneur­
ial groups in the colony in rubber and light industry competed successfully
with the expatriate firms. Moreover, by 1954, more than half a million
Chinese had been resettled (almost twice the amount originally envisaged)The Colonies, Politics and Economic Development 133
at a cost of about $100 million. The areas of resettlement were also the
main areas of rubber cultivation and tin mining. Therefore, some emerging
lobbies touched on matters of import policies and development finance.
Groups with a vested interest in reorienting Malaya’s external economic
policies away from traditional sterling area policies were in the making.
In Kenya, by 1956, Mau Mau revolt had come under control after the big
military offensive of 1954. However, British concerns about a stable Kenya
persisted. Moreover, commercial agricultural entrepreneurs based in Kiku­
yuland continued to gain strength and began to get a hold on the colonial
economy. Given the range of produce of these enterprises and their import
and development propensities, the country fitted increasingly uncomfort­
ably into the sterling area and particularly into any kind of free trade
arrangements that might include the colonies. 24
3. Colonial politics, institutions and economic liberalization
During economic liberalization, the colonial state continued to play a key
role in executing British policy designs. However, Britain’s relations with
colonial states were different from those during the discriminatory period,
and local politics impacted on colonial economic institutions and policies
in a modified way. The colonial state was no longer at the core of a central­
ized operation of physical controls for managing ‘unrequited’ exports.
British policy-makers hoped that the empire would return to quasi-self-
reliant gradualism in economic development. The colonial state ought not
to initiate a development drive in commodity production, as had been
advocated by Labour.
Industrialization, so cherished by many political activists on the periphery,
was not an aim of imperial policy either. However, the colonies that were
holding excess amounts of sterling might provide useful markets for Britain
during a future recession in the world economy. Colonial governments
found themselves confronted with the delicate task of adjusting imperial
economic relations to a liberalizing sterling area without provoking funda­
mental changes in monetary arrangements and a large-scale liberalization in
colonial trade, with the dollar area in particular. 25
From the British perspective, colonial economic institutions ought to
change only in so far as they had to accommodate modified objectives.
Economic multilateralism must not lead to large-scale reforms of economic
institutions in the colonies because Britain needed to control the colonial
balances. For example, as previously, the West African marketing boards
effectively immobilized funds, thereby cushioning inflation. But now sur­
pluses had to be reduced and the accumulation of these funds had to be
checked. The boards could even channel some of their funds towards devel­
opment uses. 26 This implied that the colonial state needed to provide a polit­
ical framework within which the marketing boards could be administered in134 Money and the End of Empire
such a way as to achieve development goals. At the same time, Britain
needed to control the eagerness of unofficial majorities on the boards from
getting out of hand, and from yielding to mounting demands from their
supporters. 27
Similarly, by 1954, the running of the currency boards had become an issue
for colonial governments in certain major territories. The introduction of
fiduciary issues required the management of an embryonic money market.
This question became linked to a debate over the role of central banks on the
periphery. Central banking had been envisaged as a move that might help to
boost the prestige of British policy without changing the basic colonial cur­
rency mechanism. 28 Colonial governments needed to create the framework
and climate for a move towards ‘central banking’ without losing control of
the management of a local currency. To fit Britain’s liberalizing policies, cen­
tral banking in the colonies merely amounted to advocating the continued
pegging of colonial currencies to sterling and the quasi-exclusive holding of
reserves in sterling. Moreover, central banks should control the introduction
of fiduciary issues, a modern money market and existing financial institu­
tions. At the same time, these banks should abstain from interfering in mar­
kets, for example by supporting the issuing of loans, and steer clear of
development initiatives. 29
The transformation from the discriminatory to the liberalizing imperial
relationship was not easy due to various economic factors in the colonies.
In the face of rising requirements for development finance, the colonies suf­
fered more and more from cuts in colonial borrowing, which were far from
being compensated by development finance from outside the sterling area.
Moreover, the availability of capital goods from Britain was still limited,
while the degree of access to external markets was insufficient.
For the British, the political and ideological situation in the empire
became more precarious, too. The gradual widening of political participa­
tion was not reversible in the important colonies. But excluding or mini­
mizing local participation in specific areas remained as crucial as it had
been for the discriminatory management of the empire earlier. Moreover,
the ‘common cause’ argument, used during the discriminatory period, was
no longer readily applicable. For example, it was difficult to impress unoffi­
cial majorities in legislative assemblies and on the marketing boards with
the argument that some colonies were so rich as not to need any develop­
ment loans, while also arguing that they should not use a sizeable part of
their accumulated resources.
None the less, for the time being political reform was popular and acted
as a surrogate for changes in the economic realm. On the whole, Britain
succeeded in retaining the allies needed during her adjustment to eco­
nomic liberalism. These allies were, as during the discriminatory period,
those political and socio-economic formations that would not challenge
the established monetary and financial arrangements unduly or urge rapidThe Colonies, Politics and Economic Development 135
economic expansion. However, attempts to influence local politicians had
now to compete with views advanced by the IBRD’s survey missions and
with independent academic observers, who were often sceptical about
colonialism. 30 In the long run, strains on colonial economic institutions
and policies were bound to increase because the economic liberalization
desired by the periphery was not the same as that implemented by Britain.
In the Gold Coast, the situation within the Cocoa Marketing Board
became increasingly difficult for the British in political terms. The Gold
Coast’s requirements for development finance had steadily increased since
the late 1940s, whereas her ability to obtain loans from Britain remained as
limited as before. Demands for using marketing board funds for a wide
range of large-scale development projects mounted. If granted, they might
prove risky because a rapid reduction of funds might increase financial
pressures on Britain. The situation was aggravated by the cocoa boom of
1954–5, which meant that sterling balances soared even further, making
their controlled reduction even more expedient. Meanwhile, the Ashanti
cocoa growers complained about continuously low producer prices, and
also urged that marketing board funds be used for development in their
own region. The challenges to the Nkrumah government from the cocoa-
growing regions of the country, therefore, became manifestly more serious
as the 1950s wore on. In 1954, these interests had organized themselves in
the Ashanti-based National Liberation Movement (NLM). 31
None the less, in the mid-1950s, both the grievances of the cocoa grow­
ers and of indigenous export entrepreneurs remained veiled and had little
impact on the political course of the colony. The Convention People’s
Party’s (CPP) success in the 1954 elections pulled the rug from under the
United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC). Its leader, Danquah, failed even to
be re-elected to the Legislative Assembly. 32 The British were also fortunate
that the government of the Gold Coast was careful in the mid-1950s not to
stir up further debates on an independently managed currency or to com­
plicate a possible regionalization of the currency boards. The fiduciary
option remained practically unused.
In Nigeria, the political situation was less acute. In the critical field of
central banking, the British were unexpectedly assisted by the constitu­
tional debate that focused on the distribution of regional powers in a fed­
eral Nigeria. The recommendation by the IBRD mission of 1953 for
establishing an independent central bank, was not exploited by local polit­
ical activists, as had been feared. The regions now had little interest in a
centralized institution such as a central bank. Nevertheless some problems
remained: moves towards reducing Nigeria’s substantial sterling balances
were largely unresolved, and the Nigerian government had welcomed the
20 per cent fiduciary option for the currency funds. 33
In Malaya, the colonial government was subject to political pressures of a
kind that affected the sterling area less directly than in the Gold Coast.136 Money and the End of Empire
However, during the period a consolidation of socio-economic forma­
tions related to rubber production and light industry in political parties
occurred, mainly along ethnic lines. The Malayan Chinese Association and
the Malayan Indian Congress represented such interests in ethnic commu­
nities which by that time had begun to seek political advancement within
Malaya rather than in their countries of origin. As for the ethnic Malay
smallholders, UMNO had become a formidable political force by the
mid-1950s that increasingly needed to accommodate the aspirations of its
business-minded constituency.
The colonial government made plain to London that certain changes
needed to be made to accommodate Malayan economic development to
reduce potential challenges from the indigenous and Chinese business
communities. For example, dollar liberalization for capital goods was now
strongly advocated and was deemed necessary to stimulate Japanese and
American investment. The economic department in Malaya felt that
Malaya’s dollar earning justified the change. 34 Debates on central banking
and monetary matters were influenced by the IBRD report on Malaya of
1955. 35 However, Malaya had incurred losses by transferring her currency
funds from short- to long-term securities. One well-informed observer
expected her, therefore, to be wary of making use of the fiduciary ele-
ment. 36 Yet, much depended on whether future requirements for Malayan
borrowing would be met. 37
In Kenya, pressures on the colonial state differed markedly from those in
West Africa and Malaya. Kenya had a more developed money market,
which could meet some important local needs; demands for a central bank
and for an independently managed currency were virtually absent. In these
respects the territory was more suited to Britain’s new plans for a liberalized
sterling area. In fact, the orthodox colonial currency board had only just
become fully established in East Africa in the 1940s after the debates of the
interwar period. 38 In the aftermath of the First World War the white settlers
in Kenya had urged Britain to change the exchange rate of the Kenyan cur-
rency. 39 However, one might speculate that the basis for further protest of
this kind was absent in the 1940s and 1950s, since the settler economy did
well during the Second World War. 40
None the less, factors that made Kenya a doubtful member of the sterling
area prevailed. The Kenyan government wanted a considerably larger fidu­
ciary issue for development purposes. The government also pressed for
more loans from London as an alternative to a further extension of the fidu­
ciary issue: loans were indeed forthcoming for Kenya, even when they had
been virtually suspended elsewhere. 41 The country was also much less con­
cerned with maintaining restrictions of imports from the dollar area. The
British continued to reject a political deal with the KAU not only because of
concerns about stability and due to Fabian development doctrine, but also
because the party’s power base among the Kikuyu entrepreneurs did notThe Colonies, Politics and Economic Development 137
correspond to British ideas of organizing economic relationships in the
Commonwealth and the empire.
4. The colonial policies of Britain’s economic liberalization
During the period of cautious economic liberalization, Britain attuned her
policies in trade, economic development, development finance and mone­
tary arrangements to the key priority of controlling the reduction of colo­
nial sterling balances. British policy within colonies was less clear-cut and
less centrally executed than it had been in the discriminatory period.
Policies needed to be more adaptable to the changing social and political
conditions within individual colonies. British policy-makers (assisted by
British representatives within colonial governments) evaluated the feasibil­
ity of specific measures and assessed the risks in economic and politi­
cal terms.
The chief measure aimed at reducing the colonial sterling balances was,
from 1954, the fiduciary option. This modest change in the operation of
the currency boards was adopted to various degrees in different colonies. 42
Moreover, in the mid-1950s, representatives of the Bank of England aimed
at increasing the liquidity of currency board funds as part of a policy that
encouraged the gradual spending of colonial balances. This attempt met
with varied success, too. The West African Currency Board (WACB) had
moved only slowly in this direction even by 1956; whereas the East African
Currency Board had gone rather further. 43
Entwined with the policy regarding the colonial sterling balances were
long-term changes in the provision of colonial loan finance. In certain
colonies, the government cautiously encouraged the emergence of a local
security market by channelling parts of surplus funds into local govern­
ment securities. 44 British government departments urged the colonies to
examine the greater use of locally available financial resources to achieve
further cuts in development spending. This prompted an increased search
by colonies for alternative financial sources from the IBRD. 45 Meanwhile,
the Colonial Office, together with colonial governments, pressed for the
strengthening of provisions of British trustee investment in order to secure
development finance for the main colonies. The aim was to keep this issue
separate from constitutional developments in the colonies by continuing
the so-called trustee status for colonies even after formal independence. 46
Eventually, the Gold Coast became the test case for successful colonial
borrowing by territories with a high degree of political participation. 47
In the crucial monetary realm, British policy-makers took care not to
embark upon a move towards ‘fully managed’ currencies. In West Africa,
officials prepared for the establishment of local currency boards. Prepa­
ration included plans for colonial central banks and in some cases, such as
the Gold Coast, the introduction of local currency notes. But this policy138 Money and the End of Empire
merely transferred the WACB from London to the colony. The Gold
Coast would have its own Bank of Issue, but it would not ‘manage its own
currency’. 48
In the administration of funds other than the currency funds in which
colonial sterling balances accumulated, policy resembled that of the pre­
ceding period. The policy of the marketing boards towards producer prices
remained conservative, at least in the Gold Coast. However, in West Africa,
some of the marketing board funds were invested in development projects.
Development funds were increasingly used to finance local development.
However, government reserve funds continued to be inflated as a result of
persistently high taxation. 49
Between 1953 and 1956, Britain was preoccupied with colonial capital
relations. However, colonial trade management still mattered with respect
to the opening of dollar imports, which was seen as a slow gradual process.
Formidable import restrictions persisted, not least due to the cocoa boom
of 1954–5. When, in 1956, the orientation of British policy towards Europe
became defined in relation to the Common Market and the Free Trade
Area, policy-makers became concerned about political instability that
might be caused by a visible marginalization of the periphery. 50 The British
attempted to assure the colonies that Britain’s association with a free trade
area in Europe would not have an adverse effect on colonial development
prospects. None the less, the British were worried that colonies with emerg­
ing manufacturing interests, such as Hong Kong and possibly Kenya, might
wish to join a free trade area before too long. 51
British policy in the above fields was also influenced by the perception of
the political evolution in the main colonies. Policy-makers took great care
to ensure that constitutional issues were discussed separately from eco­
nomic ones and did not impede existing economic arrangements. 52 The
British considered the political risks to be the most serious in the Gold
Coast. Nigeria was doubtful because of a possible spill-over from develop­
ments in the Gold Coast. 53 However, the federalism debate of the mid­
1950s, and, ironically, the banking scandal of 1956 diverted attention from
matters that worried the British rather more. 54 The Gold Coast was the
priority also because of constitutional changes towards independence
envisaged for the end of 1956. In Malaya, debates about the complicated
relationships between the Malay territories and Singapore diluted, rather
than strengthened, pressures on Britain, and Britain continued to rely on
its alliance with Malay nationalists represented by UMNO. 55
The British tackled the situation in the Gold Coast as follows. By the
mid-1950s, the general policy approach in West Africa had shifted towards
ensuring the suitable form of ‘management’ of local currencies by ‘central
banking’ instead of obstructing such a move altogether. 56 Accordingly,
British colonial officials and policy-makers in London continued to sup­
port Nkrumah and the CPP. When, in 1954, the party followed the UGCCThe Colonies, Politics and Economic Development 139
in demanding a central bank in its election manifesto, it did so in a form
that was attuned to British demands. The Gold Coast Cabinet had agreed
not to question the territory’s future participation in the sterling area, the
full currency backing (with the prospect of a gradual and slow reduction),
and the general maintenance of the link with sterling. 57 Not surprisingly,
the British welcomed these decisions, 58 which followed earlier British
advice to the Nkrumah government on how it should tackle critical ques­
tions on currency matters raised by the opposition in the Legislative
Assembly. 59 Even so, one can occasionally find dissenting views among
colonial government advisers which showed less regard for Britain’s ster­
ling relationships. Some advisers, for example, thought that a deliberate
phasing in of an independent monetary policy might be expedient for the
future development of the Gold Coast economy. 60
The British also made considerable efforts in ‘personal engineering’ to get
the appropriate provisions on the statute book for a Gold Coast Bank of
Issue. An adviser from the Bank of England drafted the statutes for this
bank. 61 The Gold Coast Finance Minister was strongly advised to follow the
suggested course. 62 Britain’s Colonial Secretary assured the Governor of the
Bank of England that he personally would see to it that the Gold Coast car­
ried through the Bank of England’s advice. 63 These activities went far
beyond simple counsel on technical matters. They reflect partisan concerns
about the smooth adjustment of policies on the periphery to British require­
ments. Such attempts at engineering political developments went along
with public relations exercises that aimed at explaining the advantages of
the sterling area, notably to the Gold Coast government. 64
5. Specific problems in colonial adjustment
Britain’s broad design in external economic policy largely accounts for the
rationale behind colonial economic policies. However, in implementing
those designs Britain met with specific problems in the areas affecting colo­
nial economic institutions, and especially the management of the sterling
balances. These problems also explain, in part, why political constellations
were so important to policy-makers.
The measures Britain took to maintain established colonial financial and
monetary relationships were prompted by a twofold concern. The first
apprehension lay with the claims that would ‘naturally’ result from
Britain’s move towards liberalization in trade and payments. These arose
from increased dollar imports and withdrawals of free sterling balances.
Such claims might well be a burden that the British economy could not
endure without the continued cooperation of the colonies.
The second apprehension was that governments on the periphery might
adopt imprudent liberalizing policies and thus further expand these ‘nat­
ural’ and expected claims. This could result from raising producer prices,140 Money and the End of Empire
decreasing taxation, stepping up imports from the dollar area at the
expense of sterling imports, or from demands for a larger reduction of the
currency cover and the local accumulation of foreign currency reserves
in dollars and gold. Until 1956, the British perceived the danger from such
policies still to be fairly remote. None the less, they considered it to
be expedient to anticipate political developments that might encourage
such moves. 65
With regard to the control of the colonial sterling balances, the Treasury
embarked upon a risk assessment exercise in 1955–6. 66 One part of the
investigation indicated how far and how quickly Britain could move
towards liberalization and where she had to manoeuvre carefully in colo­
nial economic policies. The other part provided an indication of how
important it was to control institutional changes. Even without taking into
account the political risks that might result from radical changes in the
West African colonies or Malaya, cautious political manoeuvring in these
colonies was deemed necessary to protect policies in the financial and
monetary field. 67
The British were most anxious about colonies where the greatest political
demands had arisen for the withdrawal of ‘untied’ colonial sterling funds,
or where possible changes in the very definition of expandable funds had
the potential drastically to increase claims on Britain. 68 This was the case
with regard to the government reserve funds, the marketing board funds
and part of the currency board funds in the Gold Coast and to a certain
extent Nigeria. To a lesser extent this applied to the government reserve
funds and part of the currency board funds in Malaya. None the less, the
British had to encourage certain changes if they wanted in the long run
markedly to reduce the holdings of sterling balances by countries such as
the Gold Coast. What the British needed in the Gold Coast, Nigeria and
Malaya were policies that enabled balances to be drawn on as and when
London saw fit. What the British needed to regulate above all were the
institutional changes that facilitated such moves. Therefore, even as late as
mid-1954, the Colonial Secretary was determined not to have African rep­
resentatives on the West African Currency Board. 69 The preoccupation of
British policy with the balances of large holders also explains why, in con­
trast to the preceding period, East Africa and the West Indies hardly figured
in policy debates on these issues. 70
None the less, the problem soon appeared to be that the British were
rather unsuccessful in reducing colonial balances and perhaps also too hes­
itant in making reduction feasible. The fiduciary issue, for example, was of
some importance in that respect. However, in West Africa, where fiduciary
issues might have helped to reduce substantial balances, the option was
hardly used. It was argued locally that such a step would complicate the
establishment of territorial currency boards. 71 By 1954, the establishment
of territorial boards had become widely regarded as unavoidable in theThe Colonies, Politics and Economic Development 141
long run, or even as a suitable tactic in the face of local political as well as
international pressures for economic self-government on the periphery. 72
The territories that took to fiduciary issues with enthusiasm also posed
problems for Britain. In Kenya, one danger was that an expansion of the
fiduciary issue, which was later conceded, 73 would undermine orthodox
colonial monetary arrangements; another was that demands for alternative
finance would increase rather than reduce pressures on the London money
market. Similarly, increasing the liquidity of the currency funds enabled the
currency boards to meet the level of withdrawals that would be forthcom­
ing when sterling balances were reduced. However, where implemented,
greater flexibility also dismantled a barrier against withdrawals. 74
Policy towards the other big colonial economic institution, the West
African marketing boards, can also be interpreted at the macro-level. One
complication related to debates among development experts about the
state’s role in the marketing of commodities, and the implicit role of the
marketing boards in the running of colonial economies. 75 Officially, the mar­
keting board funds were to operate as buffer funds, designed to accumulate
funds during boom prices for commodities on the world market, and to
release funds to support producer prices during a slump on the world mar­
ket. However, it proved increasingly difficult to argue why producers
should not profit from permanently higher world prices. Moreover, as the
most prominent critic held, the income of producers was not stabilized
because of the decreasing output volume. Therefore, cocoa producers in
Ashantiland launched criticism against the way the marketing boards oper­
ated because producer prices were kept fairly low even after several years of
a solid world price. The British, however, were wary of the inflationary and
expansionist effects of higher producer prices and their repercussions on
the sterling area.
Another, perhaps even more important, problem related to the link in
British policy between a reduction of the sterling balances and the allocation
of development finance, and had a strong political connotation. The market­
ing board funds officially accumulated in the interests of the producers. The
expropriation of funds for their use as development finance at the territorial
level was troublesome. The government relied on taxation as a politically
more acceptable means to tap marketing surpluses without direct interfer­
ence with the boards. One strategy used to dodge the political conundrum of
employing marketing funds for general development goals was a high export
duty, siphoning off the margin above a certain world price. The boards’ role
in protecting the producers from the international firms may have eased
political tension. However, the accumulation and even more so the expropri­
ation of the marketing board funds was politically explosive. 76
Pressures for additional development finance were a serious concern for
the British. Such demands could be rejected in West Africa with reference to
the sterling balances, but posed a problem in Kenya. Even in West Africa,142 Money and the End of Empire
the continued de facto stop on London loans was unlikely to diminish the
lobbying for credits and monetary changes among the indigenous business
community and the Ashanti cocoa growers in the Gold Coast. 77 Alternatives,
however, such as loans from the IBRD, implied an assessment by the IBRD
of the colonial economy in question. The British viewed this development
with anxiety, even if they preferred it to possible IBRD investigations of the
British economy. Moreover, the IBRD required Britain to act as the ultimate
guarantor of the Bank’s colonial loans. The British agreed to this request,
though very reluctantly. 78 To some extent, the British found themselves cor­
nered between the monetary and financial requirements of their own policy
designs and the ‘monetarist’ colonial economic management advocated by
the IBRD. 79 The former responded to sterling area needs and priorities in
Britain’s external economic policy, while the latter was more directly con­
cerned with meeting debt-servicing objectives. The IBRD placed greater
emphasis on active colonial monetary management, including exchange
rates. However, both approaches did not amount to an overall strategy of
peripheral development.
Particularly unsettling for the British were the recommendations of sur­
vey missions of Nigeria and Malaya by the IBRD; some passages of these
reports encouraged moves towards the local management of currencies. 80
British officials considered such recommendations to be dangerous in view
of the volatile political climate in certain colonies. The Bank of England
wanted future terms of reference for IBRD missions to be drafted in such a
way as to disallow comments on the colonial sterling exchange standard. 81
However, the Colonial Office warned of the political repercussions such a
measure might have in the colonies concerned. Therefore, the Office agreed
with the Treasury to foster informal influence as an alternative. 82 For exam­
ple, the Bank of England attempted to informally influence the author of
the IBRD report on Malaya before its publication. 83 Likewise, with respect to
Nigeria, the follow-up investigation by the Bank of England, prepared in
1956, explored the recommendations of the IBRD in a purely formal way. In
reality, this mission was intended to pay ‘lip-service’ to the recommenda­
tions, and was a tactical move to appease local public opinion while moving
local policy in the ‘right’ direction. 84
In a similar fashion, the Bank of England and the Treasury backed the
Gold Coast government in fending off claims from the commercial Bank of
the Gold Coast, founded in 1953. 85 The director of this bank had the
unwelcome ambition of encouraging demands for independent monetary
management, defying the doctrines that underpinned Britain’s external
economic policy. 86 His ambition might have been inspired by a concern to
promote a more active development policy in the territory. This course
implied public discussion of conditions of local borrowing, the collateral
required, and guarantees against the devaluation of securities as a way of
stimulating the market.The Colonies, Politics and Economic Development 143
In spite of these problems, in mid-1956 the British still remained confi­
dent that constitutional changes, including the move towards an indepen­
dent Gold Coast (scheduled for 1957), would not affect the country’s
fundamental relationships with the sterling area. Claims on British resources
that would arise were thought to be manageable as long as the Gold Coast
government pursued what the British considered to be ‘responsible’ policies.
The British willingly yielded to the Gold Coast government’s wish to intro­
duce its own currency as long as it remained merely an expression of
national prestige and did not involve an independent monetary policy. 87
Britain’s assessment of potential political threats in Malaya and Nigeria
showed even less concern than in the case of the Gold Coast. This percep­
tion, however, was soon to change. 88
6. Conclusion
This and the previous chapter have shown how and why the relevance of
the colonies to Britain lessened between 1953 and 1956. Moreover, the pre­
sent chapter has developed an argument about the logic of Britain’s colo­
nial policies as part of her wider external economic relations, notably with
regard to colonial monetary arrangements, loan finance, and the market­
ing boards.
Britain’s foreign economic policy shifted towards the liberalization of
trade and the convertibility of sterling. The Conservative government held
the view that continuing trade discrimination and the inconvertibility of
the pound would in the long run do harm to sterling’s international role
and thus also to the British economy. In addition, developments on the
continent of Europe suggested a serious reconsideration of Britain’s Euro­
pean relations. Significantly, by this time Europe had joined the United
States as the most important market for the competitive sectors of British
industry.
Previously, Britain had been interested in boosting certain types of com­
modity production in the colonies as a means of supporting the sterling
area. During the liberalizing period, discriminatory management gave way to
the monitoring of claims on the British economy. Under liberalization, these
were likely to arise from withdrawals of colonial sterling balances. Moreover,
important colonies were not expected to continue to forgo spending on
development of considerable parts of their current surpluses with the dol­
lar area. If they did, colonial claims for development loans would soar.
Consequently, British policy aimed at reconciling the established imperial
economic relations with liberalization. This was no easy task.
From 1953 strains on the orthodox colonial financial and monetary
arrangements mounted, and Britain had difficulties ensuring that demands
by economic and political formations on the periphery conformed to
adjustments she needed to make for a liberalized sterling area. Changes in144 Money and the End of Empire
monetary arrangements, designed to allow a gradual reduction of colonial
balances and to unburden the London money market, all too easily devel­
oped into a debate about independent colonial monetary policies. In addi­
tion, demands for the local accumulation of dollar and gold reserves grew.
The colonial governments’ dollar-saving propaganda of earlier years gave
the dollar added importance in the eyes of the public. Colonies also
required more capital goods from dollar sources for development purposes.
The general legacy of colonial dollar earning, too, acted as a strong stimu­
lus of such demands. These various elements implied the gradual erosion
of the colonial sterling standard, the very basis of the economic link of the
empire with Britain.
None the less, British policy-makers thought that they would be able to
cope with these problems. They trusted their ability to influence colonial
politicians and to direct colonial policies into channels they deemed acce­
ptable, irrespective of concessions towards wider political participation in
the colonies and, ultimately, independence. But structural contradictions
between the established colonial economic arrangements and Britain’s lib­
eral policy designs rapidly became better understood. A dilemma loomed,
among others, in the field of development finance, and also affected the
long-term solution of the problem of the sterling balances and the settle­
ment of sterling area trade. These issues, as we shall see, eventually broke
open in the aftermath of the Suez crises early in 1957. By that time, British
policy-makers had good reason to doubt their prowess in regulating
increasingly assertive state structures on the periphery.

Table A.7.1 summarizes the risk assessment made by the British Treasury in the mid­
1950s with regard to the withdrawal of colonial sterling balances. The assessment
evaluated the potential burden on British resources.
The results are based on an assessment of the risks of withdrawals from different
types of funds, which had previously already served as the basis of an ad hoc evalua­
tion of risk by policy-makers, and thus links up with the problem of expandable/
‘excess’ balances (for which see chapter 3 and A.9.1). Originally, only government
funds and funds earmarked for development were considered to be expandable.
Then, however, exercises began to include in their evaluation an additional margin of
a reduction of currency funds of up to 20 per cent, and some reduction in marketing
board funds (in certain territories). However, no large reduction in currency funds
was expected. The exercises first assumed no sudden withdrawals, but then assessed
the ‘worst-case scenario’, that is, expansionist economic policies on the periphery
and expected withdrawals, even if such policies incurred considerable losses in a terri-
tory’s investments. By 1958, the official assessment again had changed in so far as a
further reduction of currency funds was deemed likely. However, it also appeared that
Britain would not be faced with a sudden withdrawal by several of the major holdersThe Colonies, Politics and Economic Development 145

of colonial balances at the same time. Withdrawals would be drawn out over a certain
period, largely determined by a territory’s economic policy, various developmental
constraints, and the fact that holders did not wish to incur losses of investment that
had not yet reached maturity. None the less, the propensity of holders of balances to
disinvest also determined British concerns about the liquidity of investments by (for­
mer) colonies (see chapter 3). Had the ‘Littler exercise’ been proved right, Britain
would have been hard-pressed to cope with demands stemming from the withdrawal
of balances, even under conservative expectations.
Table A.7.2 shows the emphasis that policy exercises in the second half of the
1950s put on the territorial evaluation of sterling assets (of Ghana and Nigeria in
particular) and on the evaluation of different types of funds.
This assessment, together with an evaluation of the political situation in various
territories, constituted the basis of the risk assessment presented in Table A.7.1. The
table reveals one of the principal, and for policy-makers worrying, findings of these
exercises: the considerable increases in government general reserve holdings in the
two territories. A general assessment of this issue can be found in chapter 3.
However, no systematic assessment of the maturity structure of the investment port­
folios of these territories was carried out. Here, the assessment for the colonies as a
whole, evaluated for the 1953 Working Party on Colonial Sterling Balances,
remained the main source. In addition, as a matter of urgency, ad hoc evaluations
were made by the Bank of England in 1957–8, which insisted that the Crown Agents
restructured the portfolios under the Bank’s supervision (see chs. 8 and 9).146 Money and the End of Empire

Separation: Britain, Empire and
the Return to Multilateralism,
Towards 1958 and Beyond8
Britain’s New Cosmopolitanism:
Financial Realignment and Imperial
Relations, 1958 and Beyond
In the late 1950s, Britain’s imperial economic relations underwent an
important transformation. Forces within Britain urged changes in external
economic policy. To British policy-makers the official convertibility of ster­
ling signalled a return to a liberal multilateral economy in which the
pound was deemed to play a leading role as a trading and reserve currency.
This move changed the nature of Britain’s economic link with the empire
and with the periphery in general. However, sterling cosmopolitanism was
difficult to revitalize in the face of domestic and external economic con­
straints. The Suez crisis revealed how fragile Britain’s economy was in the
global context without the support of the United States. Moreover, cos­
mopolitanism required a reordering of relationships that had developed
during the war and the discriminatory period of sterling area management.
Policies in the areas of capital exports, development finance, trade arrange­
ments and the sterling balances bear out Britain’s attempt to adjust estab­
lished imperial relations to the requirements of liberal multilateralism. One
can argue that cosmopolitanism was ultimately irreconcilable with estab­
lished imperial financial relationships. To some extent, moreover, the bal­
ance of power in the British polity shifted, so that the advocates of empire
lost influence while for sterling supporters the empire’s transitional role
ceased to exist. The late 1950s witnessed a complex interaction in Britain
of domestic and external changes which is by no means fully understood
or investigated. There is more to the story than Prime Minister Macmillan’s
personal role in leading Britain away from an allegedly costly empire. The
economic priorities of the British polity lay outside the empire, unlike a
decade earlier. Available research has hitherto emphasized Britain’s chang­
ing relationships with Europe without interpreting the rationale of the dis­
entanglement of her relationships with the empire and the sterling area
and with little reference to her attempts to establish a sterling area suited
to cosmopolitanism. The following account attempts to contribute to
redress the balance. 1
149150 Money and the End of Empire
1. The cosmopolitan welfare state
The convertibility of sterling in 1958 marked the return to some form of
cosmopolitanism, cherished by prominent exponents of the British polity
and central to Britain’s international role before the war. 2 The step changed
the conditions for Britain’s foreign economic relations and, one might
argue, transformed the accumulation strategies of the British state by
increasing the significance of international competition and reducing pro­
tected niches of economic activity. 3 Domestically, policy priorities had to
be attuned to the new constraints of liberal multilateralism, such as the
convertibility of current transactions under growing trade liberalization. In
1957–8 British policy upheld the doctrine that sterling and British capital
exports were critical for liberalized international trade and world liquidity.
This was a delicate matter, however, given Britain’s uncertain place in the
new multilateral economy. The experience of Suez reminded policy-makers
that Britain was unable to withstand serious reserve crises on her own. 4
The revived cosmopolitanism was more fragile than the one that had
sustained the British economy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries because it occurred in a different international economic envi­
ronment and against the background of different domestic economic fun­
damentals. Although the dollar gap was closing, Britain’s balance of
payments and reserve position were still volatile, and the recovery of 1958
was only temporary. 5 Britain struggled to maintain the required balance of
payments surplus without devaluation and was in dire straits vis-à-vis her
capital export objectives. Moreover, the claims by overseas countries on
their accumulated capital continued to pose potential risks.
The convertibility of sterling significantly changed the nature of Britain’s
relationship with the sterling area and prompted a deflationary backlash in
domestic economic management. The rationale of the sterling area had
previously consisted of multilateral settlements within the group while dis­
criminating against the outside world. The part played by individual mem­
bers critically hinged on British concessions, notably privileged access to
the London money market. This aspect of the sterling area vanished with
convertibility and cosmopolitanism. None the less, a liberal cosmopolitan
sterling area was conceivable, either as the result of a return to sterling as
the principal international currency, or in the form of a group consisting of
countries that supported sterling by retaining the pound for reserve pur­
poses. But this required confidence in the British economy and was
unlikely to lead to a voluntary holding of surpluses similar in size to those
previously accumulated by some sterling area members. 6
Sustaining Britain’s new cosmopolitanism, when sterling area support
was faltering, required internal financial restructuring. Bank Rate was now
used as a tool to check domestic demand to an even greater extent than
earlier in the 1950s. 7 In 1959, the Radcliffe Committee sounded out a wideBritain’s New Cosmopolitanism 151
range of experts on desirable structural changes in the credit system and
new options in monetary policy to control inflationary pressures better. 8
There was now no alternative to convertibility: without it sterling’s role as
an international currency was at an end. Speculative sterling crises needed
to be avoided. The sterling crisis in the summer of 1957 was evidence of
the dangers inherent in implementing convertibility in a hesitating way. 9
In 1958, new pressures were also arising from within Britain, as investors
started to circumvent exchange restrictions by using the emerging Euro­
dollar market. 10
From the late 1950s, the empire proved to be an irritant rather than an
asset for the pursuit of Britain’s cosmopolitan ambitions. The areas of the
imperial economic relationship most affected by Britain’s cosmopolitan
objectives included the position of (ex-)colonial territories within the ster­
ling area framework, capital flows to the colonies and trade patterns. In
addition, conflicts emerged between long-established colonial monetary
and financial arrangements and liberal multilateralism.
The large (ex-)colonial holders of sterling balances, Ghana, Malaya and
Nigeria, wished to throw part of their accumulated balances on the market
and convert them into dollars or gold. And the main holders of sterling
balances had no wish to continue to pursue a policy of accumulation. The
best Britain could hope for was to preserve a cordial relationship on limit­
ing withdrawals from developing into a major row. The (ex-)colonies’
eagerness to boost their own economic development and the increasing
amount of borrowing required for such purposes made them unlikely can­
didates for a reformed liberal version of the sterling area. Moreover, the
trend of commodity prices raised concerns among policy-makers about the
long-term prospects of countries reliant on primary exports. 11
Britain’s cosmopolitanism also prompted a further shift of investment
away from the empire. British investors sought more secure and profitable
outlets in previously closed markets outside the sterling area, and also
found new outlets in the Eurodollar market. After convertibility, moreover,
the government had few incentives to counteract investment opportunities
set by the market. Any attempt to do so would have contradicted the lib­
eral doctrines of external economic management and thus destabilized
sterling; and any possible returns on the trade side for Britain would have
materialized only in the very long term. 12 From the perspective of the accu­
mulated capital patterns, it was, furthermore, crucial that British capital did
not flow to important (ex-)colonial holders of balances. Britain’s cos­
mopolitan policy made her wary of channelling capital to the empire.
Mounting colonial borrowing not only stood in the way of an adjustment
of the capital side of the British balance of payments to liberal multilateral­
ism, but would also impede the London market from meeting claims that
needed to be prioritized under the new policy objectives. At the same time,
cosmopolitanism demanded a different management of trade flows from152 Money and the End of Empire
previous periods. In view of sterling’s continuing role as an international
currency, exports needed to be encouraged either to areas short of sterling
or to areas with considerable growth potential. It was not enough simply to
boost exports by promoting growth in Britain; nor was it satisfactory to
support protected markets, as had been the case during the period of
inconvertible sterling. 13
On top of this, Britain’s cosmopolitanism conflicted with mechanisms that
provided essential finance for colonial development. Hitherto, continuously
increasing balances and practices of inter-colonial investment had supported
the market for colonial loans. Such support, however, was inappropriate in a
liberal money market; nor would it help confidence in sterling. It was not a
feasible strategy either, given the reduction of available balances. Further­
more, colonial monetary arrangements were unlikely to survive expansionist
economic policies on the periphery, which were, at least in part, a corollary
of international liberalization. 14 In addition, domestic financial restructuring
in Britain meant a greater flexibility in investment options for institutional
investors and less support for arrangements that were unlikely to sustain
themselves in a free market. Thus, the prerogative of colonial trustee status,
which had channelled funds from British institutional investors to the
colonies, became practically redundant. 15
2. Cosmopolitanism and external economic relations
Between 1957 and 1960, the domestic factors that affected Britain’s imper­
ial relationships were exacerbated by a host of external influences from
the international economy, continental Europe and the United States. The
international economic environment changed considerably with trade lib­
eralization and currency convertibility. Under convertibility, Britain was
also required before too long to accede to the IMF provisions on non­
discrimination. Trade and, to an increasing extent, capital were allowed to
move with far less restriction than previously and according to the propen­
sities of the market. As it turned out, this new freedom presented risks for
Britain’s position within the transformed international economic order. 16
The major strains on Britain’s imperial relationships ensued from prob­
lems of international liquidity and capital flows, and from changes in trade
patterns. The new multilateralism aggravated the international liquidity
problem that had developed since the early 1950s as a result of growth in
trade among industrialized countries. The ratio between the volume of
international trade and international reserves declined markedly between
the 1940s and 1960s. By end of the 1950s, concerns had arisen among eco­
nomic policy-makers as to how to achieve a sustainable convertibility of
currencies. 17 It turned out that Bretton Woods faced the inescapable prob­
lem that the US deficit provided dollars to the world on the one hand,
while, on the other, the deficit required the United States to settle paymentsBritain’s New Cosmopolitanism 153
to an increasing degree with its gold reserves. European countries, in sharp
contrast to the 1950s, were now wary of accumulating too high a level of
dollar reserves. This increased speculative pressure on the dollar and ham­
pered world liquidity. The dollar shortage of the late 1940s and much of the
1950s turned into the so-called dollar ‘glut’. The crisis finally led to the
creation of the IMF’s special drawing rights in 1968 to solve the world’s
liquidity problem. 18
In the 1960s, Britain’s far-fetched hopes that the return to cosmopoli­
tanism would restore the pound sterling to its former glory and do away
with her difficulties in external economic relations were shattered, in spite
of boom conditions in the world economy. Britain soon faced problems
similar to those she had encountered in the 1950s, namely severe current
account deficits and reserve shortages. The overall level of the sterling
balances remained high. Despite considerable efforts to boost exports to
industrialized countries, Britain continued to suffer from a comparatively
poor export performance. Balance of payments crises occurred in 1961 and
again from the mid-1960s. Sterling was not able to benefit from the weak­
ness of the dollar. Rather, the world liquidity crisis meant that occasionally
(though reluctantly) a lifeline was extended to sterling, without the cur­
rency regaining much appeal. The London money market continued to be
under considerable pressure. There were protracted quarrels over a possible
devaluation of sterling, which eventually occurred in 1967, and, at various
points, the Bank of England had to rally other central banks and the IMF in
support of the pound. The call was heeded largely because international
monetary institutions feared that the collapse of the pound might drive
the international economy into turmoil at a time when there were already
serious problems with the dollar. 19
Furthermore, the trend towards inter-industrial trade by the late 1950s
was compounded by a growing trend in the sterling area away from British
markets. These trends upset Britain’s long-established trade and payments
patterns. 20 Hitherto Britain had balanced her deficits in the trade of visibles
with the dollar area via surpluses in the trade of visibles and, more impor­
tantly, invisibles with the sterling Commonwealth; the colonial sterling
area achieved a surplus with the dollar area and to a lesser extent with
Europe. Moreover, Britain required the imports in visibles from the sterling
Commonwealth to balance her exports in invisibles to this area. At the end
of the 1950s, this mechanism became distorted. 21 The colonial sterling area
no longer secured a sufficient surplus with the dollar area, and on occasion
incurred a deficit. This problem was heightened by a developing slump
in world prices for important commodities. Similarly, the sterling
Commonwealth was less able to achieve a surplus in visibles with Britain in
order to balance a deficit in invisibles. Moreover, European liberalization
and the dissolution of the European Payments Union with convertibility
in Europe further undermined the existing settlement mechanism because154 Money and the End of Empire
it prompted increased competition with products from the sterling
Commonwealth. 22
European economic reorganization had the potential of aggravating the
trend towards changes in trade flows. 23 The European common market, as
agreed by the signatories of the Treaty of Rome in 1957, pledged members
to give overseas territories some form of associate status in the long term.
This agreement hampered access to European markets for British colonies
and the sterling Commonwealth, and thereby jeopardized the surpluses for
sterling area settlement. But a European free trade area that included
Britain together with the colonies and/or sterling Commonwealth might
deflect important sterling area exports from Britain to Europe. The alterna­
tive of Britain joining a European common market without her overseas
territories and the Commonwealth (a proposal which came on the political
agenda in 1959–60) might accommodate new trends in trade and capital
flows, but was also likely to increase claims on the London money market.
Not least, such a step implied a radical departure from past trade ties and
risked increasing the chances of Britain being presented with sudden
claims for releasing (ex-)colonial sterling balances, which remained an
unresolved issue.
By the late 1950s, Britain was thus compelled to alleviate increasing ster­
ling area deficits by boosting her trade balance with North American and
European markets. In this respect, the old arrangements had become a lia­
bility rather than an asset. However, if the pound was to be maintained as
an international currency, it was crucial to sustain a settlements system
that was able to accommodate sterling’s role within a liberal world econ-
omy. 24 This became all the more important because the European dollar
shortage vanished in the late 1950s as the United States slid into deficit
and therefore supplied the world with dollars. As a result, the dollar
became the principal currency in international trade and not simply a cur­
rency that was hoarded in reserves. By 1960, sterling coexisted with the
dollar as a key currency, but remained hampered by Britain’s poor balance
of payments and by speculative claims of liquid liabilities. 25 Given this
context, it was essential for Britain that problems of development finance
and capital exports were addressed at the international level.
Britain required substantial international (and particularly US) support
for schemes that supplemented development finance in areas that were
being neglected by changing investment flows. This concerned areas of
potential growth, such as the ‘new’ Asian Dominions, and regions that
were an increasing drain on British resources, such as the colonies and
recent ex-colonies. International arrangements ought to help the London
money market over a period during which it faced more claims than it
could cope with. The creation of the International Finance Corporation in
1955, and particularly the founding of the International Development
Association in 1960, were steps in this direction. Meanwhile, the BritishBritain’s New Cosmopolitanism 155
hoped that domestic recovery would put Britain’s balance of payments in a
shape that allowed her to seek a reduction of the (ex-)colonial sterling bal­
ances, and also boost the level of British capital exports to the extent that
was required to sustain sterling as a leading international currency. 26
But the United States was distinctly unwilling to be subjected to Britain’s
policy designs. US economic diplomacy in the late 1950s and early 1960s
gave Britain a degree of support, but also challenged her position. 27 The
Suez crisis of late 1956, as is well known, almost broke the pound. The gen­
eral speculation against sterling and pressure on the sterling exchange rate
heightened with the US refusal to support the pound with credits, either
directly or via the US-dominated IMF; renewed rumours about a devalua­
tion were inevitable. At the same time, India withdrew sterling balances,
and Britain, for fear of further repercussions on international confidence in
the pound, deemed it necessary to continue with the scheduled allocation
of the instalment of blocked Egyptian balances (unlike the United States
which blocked assets that Egypt had moved to New York after the 1947 cri­
sis). Britain’s reserves suffered severely as a consequence of all these factors
as the move to convertibility drew near. 28 To make things worse, some
countries in the Middle East cut off their oil supplies to Britain, who
needed to resort to buying oil with dollars that were still scarce. None the
less, Britain ultimately reached an arrangement with the United States and
this had a twofold effect: loans from the Exim Bank and the IMF in 1957
mitigated some of the losses that Britain incurred during the crisis, but
these also placed new burdens of repayment upon the British economy. 29
In 1961, on the other hand, when confidence in sterling had been dam­
aged and devaluation once again seemed unavoidable, the United States
(in conjunction with other central banks) extended a lifeline to sterling
so as not to jeopardize its supporting role to the dollar as an international
currency. 30
The United States needed the British as an ally on the road to establish­
ing a liberal international economic order, 31 and as a strategic ally in the
‘Cold War’ too. 32 As we have seen, the United States had condoned
Britain’s recourse to discrimination in the empire because it helped
Britain’s postwar recovery. 33 But, while the United States shared some of
Britain’s concerns, notably in relation to the problem of the sterling bal­
ances, she was reluctant to put the British back on their feet as an indepen­
dent power. Britain’s growing dependence on US support allowed the
Americans to tie her more closely to principles of managing the interna­
tional economy that were guided by their concerns for the dollar. 34 In this
respect, any inclination by peripheral countries to move into the dollar for
reserve purposes and their need for development assistance from the
United States, which was usually tied to US exports, suited US policy
designs. By the late 1950s, the Americans had realized the periphery’s
potential for becoming part of the dollar-based, liberal trading world. The156 Money and the End of Empire
United States was beginning to assume a role as a capital exporter to these
areas – a position that Britain had occupied for decades. 35
3. The imperial policy of cosmopolitanism
By 1957, in view of the imminent convertibility of sterling, British policy
had again become preoccupied with problems on the current side of the
balance of payments, as it had been the case in the late 1940s and early
1950s. At the same time, however, the situation on the capital side
remained menacing because cosmopolitan sterling without a relatively lib­
eral practice in allowing capital movements was a contradiction in terms.
The Suez shock in late 1956 prompted a renewed emphasis in domestic
economic policy on deflationary measures. The corollary in external eco­
nomic policy was that the British put even greater emphasis on exports to
boost Britain’s balance of payments. 36 This objective entailed policy
changes towards the empire, notably in the fields of borrowing and devel­
opment assistance, and again heightened the persistent problem of the
colonial sterling balances. These reconsiderations were embedded within
the broader debates flowing from post-Suez policy reviews (and others
which Suez had made more topical). These reviews focused on the role of
British capital exports, on borrowing from outside Britain and the sterling
area, on the effects on the sterling area of a European free trade area or cus­
toms union, as well as on initiatives to salvage some role for the sterling
area under conditions of multilateralism. 37
The sharp rise in Bank Rate during 1957 was Britain’s principal means of
controlling capital exports. For the colonies this meant that the opportu­
nity to borrow on the London money market was now greatly restricted.
The use of Bank Rate enabled policy-makers to hide more important struc­
tural problems for prospective colonial borrowing. Between February 1957
and July 1958 a virtual moratorium on colonial loans from the London
market existed. Thereafter, the situation for colonial loans scarcely im­
proved, even when Britain pursued a slightly less deflationary policy. 38
Britain rearranged development finance for the colonies and the
Commonwealth in order to shape a pattern of capital exports in line
with her cosmopolitan ambitions. By 1958, British policy had become
uncharacteristically keen to foster multilateral schemes of development
assistance, especially for Africa. The new framework included the Economic
Commission for Africa and the Foundation for Mutual Assistance in Africa
South of the Sahara (FAMA) of the Commission for Technical Co-operation
in Africa South of the Sahara (CCTA). 39 The British encouraged discussions
about the establishment of an international development agency to be
associated with the IBRD. The main hopes in the long run were placed in
multilateral IBRD schemes, loans from the United States Development
Fund, and in some cases on borrowing by British colonies on the New YorkBritain’s New Cosmopolitanism 157
money market. 40 In fact, in 1958 Jamaica raised the first British colonial
loan in New York. 41 However, on the whole, officials discovered that there
was little leverage for borrowing from outside the sterling area that would
alleviate pressures on the London money market.
The alternative was the reorganization of bilateral development arrange­
ments and the advocacy of restraint. Bilateral financial flows were expected
to find their own level in relation to the creditworthiness of individual
borrowers. 42 The bulk of finance was to come from private sources.
Government-to-government loans were not to be given to independent
Commonwealth countries. 43 Moreover, the Colonial Development Corpo­
ration (CDC) was only to continue in an advisory function after a country’s
independence. 44 The Commonwealth Development Finance Corporation
(CDFC) and the CDC were to continue to operate as private finance com­
panies, preferably supported by some form of IBRD lending scheme. 45
However, the involvement of the IBRD proved difficult since the Bank
demanded that its loans be given government guarantees, which Britain
was reluctant to grant. 46
In order to get a grip on capital exports, Britain also sought closer reci­
procity between development finance and British exports in line with cur­
rent payments and capital patterns. Consequently, the role of the Export
Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) markedly increased. Apart from
these export loans, there was no mandatory tying of British loans.
However, in practice, large capital exports were judged on their merit for
sterling area development or for their potential in enhancing British
exports. 47 With this objective in mind, a new policy on Commonwealth
economic development was eventually announced at the Montreal
Commonwealth Conference in 1958. Additional loans were pledged for the
independent Commonwealth within the ECGD arrangements; the precise
amount depended on Britain’s economic position. For the colonies, provi­
sions for loans from the Exchequer were made within the framework of
the CD&W Act of 1958. But priority was still given to open-market loans.
To facilitate access to the market, colonial borrowing was reorganized to
allow subordinate authorities, namely public utilities (though not regions
or municipalities), to apply to the London market for loans on their own
merit. 48
The Suez crisis aggravated Britain’s concerns about the capital side of her
balance of payments. Policy-makers wished to stifle any talk about ‘wind­
ing up’ the sterling system and to foster confidence in British policy to pre­
vent important members of the sterling area from leaving. 49 Officials
expected a drain of about £800 million over the forthcoming five-year
period from the reduction of colonial currency covers and the greater use
of development funds. This made it imperative to watch withdrawals of
colonial and Indian sterling balances closely. The main British concern was
to anticipate and limit damage that might arise from policies in the large158 Money and the End of Empire
ex-colonies Ghana and Malaya, 50 as well as from developments in colonies,
such as Nigeria. In addition, the British courted holders of sterling balances
in the Middle East, notably Kuwait, in order to direct rising oil balances
into acceptable channels. The ruler of Kuwait was to be persuaded to
restructure his portfolio in favour of British long-term securities, though it
is not recorded whether he heeded the suggestion. 51
Claims from holders of colonial balances reopened the convoluted
debate on the management of colonial finances that had originated in the
early 1950s because it turned out that the policy measures taken at that
time had failed to produce the required results. The issues addressed were
the familiar ones of the risk and impact of colonial withdrawals, the liquid­
ity of the colonial portfolio, the mechanisms for providing finance for
colonial development and the possibility of using accumulated balances for
this purpose. The collection of adequate statistics on the balances and colo­
nial finances again came high on the agenda, as it had been between 1953
and 1955; in 1957, the problem was also bound up with Macmillan’s policy
review of the colonies. 52
The British brought political pressure to bear, especially on Ghana, to
control the withdrawal of balances. They also took steps to change the
structure and increase the liquidity of colonial investment portfolios in
terms of the type of securities held. Policy-makers particularly feared that
Ghana, as well as Kenya and Malaya, might destabilize the market for colo­
nial securities beyond repair by pursuing a selling policy. 53 By late 1958,
however, British concerns about a rapid withdrawal of the balances in gen­
eral and the sale of colonial stock in particular had receded. 54 None the less,
problems mounted with respect to the support given to colonial finances by
inter-colonial investment from the Crown Agents. 55 Furthermore, with con­
vertibility at the end of 1958 which implied the liberalization of trade with
the dollar area, policy-makers were at an even greater loss in presenting the
case for sterling area membership, when pressure from the periphery for
holding more dollars and gold increased. The British attitude became
markedly more defensive; the ‘merit’ of the sterling area was a matter better
not talked about. 56
The Treaty of Rome made this already complicated situation even more
intricate. 57 Britain (like the United States) was worried about the future
association of overseas territories with a European common market. During
1957, the British took a number of initiatives to minimize the possible
effects of such a move in bilateral negotiations and in consultations with
the GATT. 58 In their confidential deliberations, though not in public state­
ments, officials were also adamant that Britain’s free trade area proposal
had to exclude her overseas territories. 59 Eventually, by mid-1959, the
British had fathomed an alternative strategy of influencing the European
common market in its policy affecting Britain’s colonies and the sterling
area by preparing to join it. 60 On the whole, economic circumstances andBritain’s New Cosmopolitanism 159
pressures from economic diplomacy in the aftermath of Suez left British
policy-makers with a great many loose ends that needed tying up.
4. The rationale of disengagement
British moves in foreign economic policy between 1957 and 1959 in vari­
ous ways signalled a restructuring of sterling area relationships. This trans­
formation also implied a disengagement from former economic links with
the empire. After Suez and convertibility, the complicated puzzle of Britain’s
external payments arrangements and capital flows had developed cracks.
At the same time, the restoration of convertibility was an attempt to resus­
citate sterling cosmopolitanism. 61 The level and direction of capital exports
became a delicate issue considering Britain’s export performance and the
future of the sterling area and of sterling as an international currency. In
general, British policy attempted to reduce external commitments while
searching for alternative sources of finance for the sterling area as well as
for Britain’s oil industry, which became an increasing burden on the
already strained London market from the late 1950s. The ideal, though
increasingly unrealistic, borrowing pattern was for the sterling Common­
wealth to borrow to a greater extent from outside the area, while Britain,
with an improving balance of payments, stepped up her overseas invest­
ment and reduced her own borrowing. Claims for credits from the London
money market had to be reduced, while maintaining London’s reputation
as a financial market.
This policy required a walk on a tightrope because demands for capital, if
deflected too forcefully, heightened rather than reduced the pressure on
the British economy. The control of British capital exports encountered
two fundamental problems. First, it was a matter of difficult judgement to
know when a reduction in capital exports would harm sterling or British
exports. Second, it was hard to influence the behaviour of private
investors. At the same time, the leverage with respect to British govern­
ment aid was narrowing. The main way to check borrowing by the sterling
area was the imposition of high interest rates in Britain. The alternative to
this would have been exchange controls within the sterling area. But this
was tantamount to abandoning the area altogether and, therefore, not an
option for most policy-makers. 62
The rearrangement of British capital exports and Britain’s increasing
search for finance from outside the sterling area affected Commonwealth
and colonial borrowing and development assistance. The British made sure
that the London market was not the main recipient of expected claims for
credits for peripheral development, at least in the short term. The quantita­
tive problem of claims on British resources was bound up with the qualita­
tive one of attuning overseas investments to payments patterns that
sustained cosmopolitanism. British capital exports did not need to go to160 Money and the End of Empire
the empire where the problem for Britain’s external payments was too
much liquidity rather than too little. 63 British exchange control was
already fairly liberal in sanctioning overseas investment outside the sterling
area, notably in Europe and Canada. The main capital flows to the
Commonwealth went to Canada and Australia, then to the colonies and
Rhodesia and New Zealand. At the end of the list came India, Pakistan and
Ceylon. 64 But Britain was no longer able to provide the required capital
exports towards the Asian Dominions, and the United States was bringing
these areas increasingly within the realm of the dollar. The British hoped
that international arrangements would counter this trend by boosting
development in areas which were short of sterling but had considerable
growth potential. In order to foster confidence in the pound and to keep
the Bretton Woods system afloat, Britain had a growing interest in promot­
ing international schemes of this kind.
The increasing importance of Britain’s management of export credit
arrangements is explicable in similar terms. These arrangements were not
devices to strengthen Britain’s export trade or to promote British manufac­
turing in their own right. Rather, they were a means to adjust Britain’s
overseas capital position, which had slipped out of control. It is indicative
that industrialists and merchant bankers were deliberately excluded from
the committee that discussed the reorganization of export credit arrange-
ments. 65 The concern with payments patterns also explains why British
officials were scared of US initiatives which aimed at tying assistance (given
by the United States Development Loan Fund) to the developing world to
US exports. The British countered this declaration with the surprising asser­
tion that none of Britain’s development assistance was tied. 66
Britain’s export performance during the period was even more important
than in previous years because the alternative and supplementary pillars,
the sterling area and especially the empire, were disintegrating. In spite of
continuing attempts by Britain to coordinate economic policies, the inde­
pendent (sterling) Commonwealth began to detach itself from the restraints
of the sterling area and to establish closer links with the dollar world from
the late 1950s. 67 To back up sterling, the British were now more interested
in preferences than the Commonwealth, and wanted Commonwealth
members to negotiate bilateral preferential trade agreements. 68
From the late 1950s, the colonial empire played a minor role for British
exports of capital goods stimulated by colonial development and for less
competitive sectors of British industry. But the (former) colonies’ crucial
role as holders of balances continued to be a potential burden and risk for
the British economy. Moreover, by that time the long-term prospects for
commodity exporters had become gloomy. Commodity prices were declin­
ing markedly, and, as import restrictions in the colonies eased, balance of
payments problems began to emerge. 69 This development was not entirely
unwelcome as long as it helped to diminish ‘excess’ balances. 70 The BritishBritain’s New Cosmopolitanism 161
were, however, wary of pressure from the periphery for entering commod­
ity agreements to stem the fall in commodity prices. Prices had already
declined with respect to tin, rubber, wool and dairy products, and had con­
siderably affected the foreign earnings of Malaya in particular. By contrast,
West African cocoa was still in a strong position on the world market.
While Malaya had a problem of decreasing commodity receipts in the late
1950s, Ghana and Nigeria were still valuable. Their exit from the sterling
area might have entailed the loss of considerable current assets as well as a
threat on the capital side. 71 Therefore, Britain had her own interests firmly
in mind in the late 1950s, when she lobbied the GATT to obtain preferen­
tial treatment for the exports of these former colonies. 72
Britain’s policy towards the European common market also provides evi­
dence of her concern to prevent changes in trade patterns that might be
detrimental to sterling’s role as an international currency. Different forms
and degrees of European association meant different impediments for
existing trade flows and payments settlements with the sterling area and
the Commonwealth. After 1957, reality bore out earlier British fears. 73
A European common market without British participation was likely to dis­
criminate against British colonial products in Europe and upset trade pat­
terns. Provisions in the Treaty of Rome for the future association of
European overseas territories affected the British colonies and Ghana in
particular. The British feared that this might also prove politically polariz­
ing in Africa and trigger illiberal trade policies on the periphery. 74 For these
reasons, Britain sought mitigation before the GATT, asking that third coun­
tries should be treated as they had been prior to the Treaty of Rome, that
the overseas territories of the EEC would not be given non-tariff prefer­
ences, and that tariffs and taxes would not be unduly discouraging for
third countries. 75 Similar mitigation might have been achieved by Britain’s
proposal for a free trade area that included the signatories of the Treaty of
Rome but excluded overseas territories. Yet this attempt failed in 1959.
Britain’s entry into the EEC was expected to have serious repercussions on
trade patterns with the Commonwealth and empire. However, in 1960
other problems posed by such a move were no longer seen as insurmount­
able. For example, access to the London money market might be limited by
granting occasional access to the European Investment Bank but not to
European governments. Outward movements of capital were anyway han­
dled with little restriction, and sterling area privileges were dissolving. 76
After 1957, the debate about a possible restructuring of the sterling area
by incorporating new members, or the possible impact of certain members
leaving the area, was rekindled. Sterling area expansionists stretched their
imagination as far as Germany, before admitting that prospering economies
hardly had an interest in joining and that no extension of the sterling area
was feasible. 77 In fact, the widening of access to London’s foreign bond mar­
ket beyond the sterling area threatened to make an important privilege of162 Money and the End of Empire
sterling area members redundant. There were grounds for postponing the
move in case Ghana and Malaya used it as a pretext for leaving the area.
Ghana and Malaya saw this step as prejudicing promises that they would be
allowed to borrow when the market situation had improved. 78 Moreover,
the British urgently needed a positive alternative to colonial sterling holders
because the blocking of balances impeded confidence in the pound in a lib­
eralized world economy and was, therefore, no longer an option. 79 None
the less, a funding operation was discarded because it brought the colonies
in a formal creditor relationship to Britain, and was thought to encourage
sales of sterling. Moreover, it was hard to judge whether or not the funding
operation was required at all. 80 In the course of these deliberations, Britain’s
priorities in the sterling area underwent another geographical shift. After
1957, the Middle East replaced the colonies as the most promising region
for the sterling area. 81
By 1959, policy-makers had realized that withdrawals of colonial bal­
ances would be protracted. Moreover, disinvestment of colonial stock was
no longer a major worry because the share of colonial securities in overall
holdings was less important than had been anticipated. However, concerns
about independent dollar holdings and the dim future for (ex-)colonial
development finance became more acute than ever. Fundamental choices
needed to be made in view of the limited prospects of finance from the
New York and London markets. 82 By that time, investors’ confidence in
African issues had virtually vanished. 83 As Britain attempted to re-establish
the pound as a leading international currency, sterling again experienced a
succession of crises. Hopes were dashed in 1961, when a central bank inter­
vention scheme (via the Bank of International Settlement in Basle) was
required to prevent the devaluation of sterling. This time the imperial ster­
ling area was no longer willing or capable of bailing Britain out, and the
Middle East was not a sufficient alternative. Britain, in turn, did not have
the resources for boosting development in the poorer areas of the sterling
Commonwealth. Nor did she have any positive incentives in the 1960s for
paying great attention to the colonies or recent ex-colonies in shaping her
external economic policy.
5. Shifts in the British polity
The Treasury and the Bank of England were the driving forces behind British
attempts to re-establish a cosmopolitan role for sterling in 1957 and 1958.
Their leading officials held the view that liberalization and expansion in
world trade required a strong pound and ultimately the resumption of
British capital exports at a large scale; even if this implied that Britain’s
economy stagnated. 84 Otherwise, world trade flows were bound to be
disrupted and developing countries, too, would suffer in the long term with
regard to capital imports. Free markets in Kuwait and Hong Kong and aBritain’s New Cosmopolitanism 163
greater level of independent gold and dollar reserves were acceptable draw­
backs provided the sterling area remained operational. 85 Moreover, in order
to promote world development, advanced countries should help to boost
growth in the underdeveloped world. Yet, Britain should not shoulder these
responsibilities for the time being. Lending to the periphery was too risky
for her reserves unless loans were tied to specific British exports. 86 The Board
of Trade, on the other hand, advocated a sterling policy that did not disad­
vantage the competitive sectors of British industry in the crucial new export
markets of Europe and the United States. Therefore, the Board favoured a
floating pound, which in fact amounted to a devaluation of sterling, and
incidentally contradicted Bretton Woods. 87 According to the Board, a float­
ing pound also had the advantage that colonies might suffer losses when
liquidating sterling balances, and thus be discouraged from throwing them
on the market all at once. Moreover, the Board recommended withdrawing
the pledge, given at the 1952 Commonwealth Conference, of a special com­
mitment to British investment in the sterling area. 88 The Treasury criticized
the Board’s support for export markets between industrialized countries for
neglecting the growth potential of developing areas. 89 But, in essence, any
active concerns which the Treasury and the Bank of England entertained
with the developing world were related to their ultimate aim of returning to
a sterling-based international trade order rather than to peripheral develop­
ment in its own right. Besides, defensive concerns with the empire persisted
with respect to the hazards the colonial sterling balances might pose for
Britain’s reserve position.
With regard to the problem of (colonial) ‘excess’ balances and the liquidity
of the colonial investment portfolio, the Bank was disconcerted that the
reduction of the colonial currency cover introduced in the mid-1950s had
not produced the desired effect. 90 The Bank doubted the Crown Agent’s
definition of vulnerable funds. 91 In 1958, the Bank’s Chief Cashier even
feared that the Crown Agents, the institution that managed the bulk of
colonial investments, might face receivership, which was bound to create a
serious confidence problem for the pound. 92 Similarly, the Bank expected a
surge in demands for development finance by the colonies and the newly
independent Commonwealth on the London money market. 93 This was
not simply a quantitative problem; lack of responsiveness in the market
might jeopardize confidence in sterling and undermine the sterling area.
To make things worse, Ghana’s and Malaya’s funds were no longer avail­
able for inter-colonial investment by the Crown Agents. This, in effect,
marked the breakdown of the pooling system that had formed a pillar of
colonial development finance. 94 On top of this, the Bank (more so than
the Treasury) 95 expected the market for colonial securities to disintegrate,
and therefore pressed for an investigation into the level of colonial stock
held by individual territories. 96 Colonial funds and liquidity turned out to
be less problematic than expected. 97 None the less, for the Bank an array of164 Money and the End of Empire
substantial problems persisted: no future buyers for colonial stock were in
sight, and, more importantly, the Crown Agents were no longer able to
support the market for colonial loans.
On the assertive side of policy-making, the Bank of England seized every
opportunity to eliminate traces of discriminatory sterling management and
long-established imperial financial practices that smacked of an impedi­
ment to market forces. The Bank was firmly opposed to giving the colonies
preferential access to the London money market. Moreover, the Bank was
prepared to take independent action to suppress trustee arrangements;
hitherto, these had provided an important support for colonial finance
because they were an essential investment option for British institutions. 98
However, to satisfy the Colonial Office, the trustee list was extended in
1959 to include recent ex-colonies, if their governments provided guaran­
tees. But this move simply caused prospects for colonial loans to deterio­
rate further. The step was anyway futile because in 1959 the government
met demands by institutional investors and considerably widened their
choice of investment. 99 The result was that changes in the Colonial Stock
Acts had only mitigating effects since there were virtually no investors left
to subscribe to these (ex-)colonial issues. 100
In this situation the Colonial Office vigorously reiterated its demand for
a scheme of Exchequer loans, given the poor outlook for colonial loans on
the London market, the obsolete status of inter-colonial borrowing prac­
tices, and the limited alternatives from the United States, Europe or the
IBRD. 101 The Office’s lobbying, however, squared badly with Britain’s cos­
mopolitan realignment, and sounded like philanthropy to those burdened
by the onerous task of managing her external relations. The Treasury
wanted the government to withdraw its commitment to colonial develop­
ment (in spite of a ministerial decision to the contrary) rather than con­
cede government loans. The Treasury even accused the Bank of England of
deliberately refraining from approving colonial loans and shifting the bur­
den of colonial development on the Exchequer. 102 Moreover, the Treasury
maintained that the CDC ought to be wound up in the long run, and only
reluctantly agreed to the extension of its borrowing margin. 103 The even­
tual compromise in mid-1958 on a clearly defined Exchequer loans
scheme, which maintained the priority of market loans, reflects concerns
about British exports of capital goods for colonial development. For this
reason existing development programmes were allowed to continue. 104
In broader terms, these departmental positions and their respective influ­
ence on policy-making can be explained as conflicts within the British
polity. In 1959, British manufacturers had grave concerns about their com­
petitiveness. Convertibility had been imposed on them, in spite of stern
opposition from the Board of Trade. 105 Important manufacturing interests
became identified with seeking a closer association with Europe. It appears
that these interests now had more influence in government than previously.Britain’s New Cosmopolitanism 165
Prime Minister Macmillan belonged to a strand of the Conservative Party
that was more inclined to listen to these groups, to open up towards
Europe, and to strive to reconcile sterling interests with those of manufac-
turing. 106 Moreover, leading politicians during the period were keenly aware
of the strings attached to the legacy of sterling area relationships. 107 None
the less, in 1959 the advocates of cosmopolitan sterling still retained formi­
dable influence in government. Whatever the personal views of the Prime
Minister and his closest associates may have been, the policy pursued
between 1957 and 1959 largely followed the positions advocated by the
orthodox supporters of sterling in the Treasury and the Bank of England. 108
However, this meant a slowing down of the British economy, so much so
that during 1958 the British had to disentangle themselves from this course
as the pressures from manufacturing mounted and the policy became coun-
terproductive. 109 By the 1960s, the Treasury and the Bank had accepted a
minor version of cosmopolitanism as a compromise. As a result, Britain’s
ties with the remaining empire or the recent ex-colonies became trans­
formed. Eventually, the members of the Bank of International Settlement
(in the Basle agreements of 1968) guaranteed the sterling balances in terms
of dollars. This came too late to revive confidence in the sterling area, which
was formally dissolved in 1972. However, already after Suez the empire’s rel­
evance to the economic programme of the key strands of the British polity,
finance and manufacturing, had vanished. This field was now left to enter­
prises with interests in certain sectors of manufacturing in specific regions,
and also to the old advocates of imperial protection. But attempts to adhere
to Commonwealth preferences were unsuccessful. Unlike in the 1930s,
important sections of British industry were not in favour of an imperial
strategy but keen on competing in continental European markets.
6. Conclusion
This chapter has argued that the convertibility of sterling in 1958 marked a
shift towards cosmopolitan sterling relationships and designs and therefore
also an important shift in Britain’s imperial relations. Moreover, our argu­
ment has underlined that British external economic policy can only be
understood with recourse to a political dimension of analysis. Officials did
not identify abstract, feasible options on the sterling area’s future and then
implement a coherent policy accordingly. British policy-makers were rather
more pragmatic and resolute in the pursuit of long-held aims. Well into the
1960s, they strove to re-establish the pound as a major international cur­
rency in the face of growing domestic and external adversities. A redefined
sterling area was a means to achieve this aim.
Therefore, policy had to establish the monetary and financial relationships
that were needed for boosting Britain’s revived cosmopolitanism. This
required sustainable arrangements for sterling-based payments covering a166 Money and the End of Empire
wide area of the globe, conditions that were conducive to an increase in
capital exports, and the revision of economic management that impeded
market forces. For Britain’s relationship with the empire, this meant a with­
drawal from further involvement with colonial development, the direction
of British capital exports away from the empire and the discontinuation of
management practices that supported peripheral development finance.
Propping up the sterling area, moreover, implied some British attempts to
retain preferential treatment for Commonwealth trade with Britain, at a time
when trade liberalization increased sterling area imports from dollar markets.
Yet, in the aftermath of Suez, the realization of Britain’s cosmopolitan
ambitions was severely hampered by continuing problems with the bal­
ance of payments and the reserves. In addition, exogenous factors, such as
changes in trade flows and the challenges of closer European association,
increased pressures on the British economy. Furthermore, by the end of the
1950s, forces within the British polity that were prepared to trade sterling
cosmopolitanism for domestic growth in manufacturing and a closer inte­
gration with Europe had gained strength. Such a reorientation implied the
marginalization of imperial economic relationships in the 1960s. At the
same time, external support, such as formerly provided by the imperial
sterling area, or substantial external borrowing for Britain, was not in sight.
Colonial sterling balances still posed risks. The balance of payments of
the overseas sterling area was deteriorating, and established arrangements
supporting colonial development finance were no longer operational.
Moreover, investment tended to move towards the industrialized world
and the Eurodollar market, while demands for finance in the remaining
colonies and recent ex-colonies soared.
Thus, after 1957, Britain became cornered between established claims
from colonial balances and prospective claims for development finance.
Orthodox economic policies with respect to the empire had reached a dead
end at a time when the dominant forces in the British polity had lost inter­
est in resuscitating them. In many ways, the conditions that had domi­
nated the rationale of Britain’s economic relationship with empire since
the Second World War had ceased to exist. The transformed role which the
periphery occupied after 1958 within Britain’s external economic relation­
ships underscores this shift towards separation.

portfolios of (former) colonies. The latter also revealed the extent to which Crown
Agent investment practices had supported the market for colonial stock (see A.9.2).
The table shows that Malaya held an unusually high amount of colonial stock in
general government funds. This issue received systematic attention in policy exer­
cises because of the Bank of England’s mistrust of the Crown Agents. None the less,
the problem of the liquidity of these portfolios was more important. For a survey of
the latter problem, see chapter 3.
Table A.8.2 is a confidential summary assessment by the Colonial Office of past
financial sources for colonial development.
This appraisal flatly contradicts the published official versions on the subject as
well as the ad hoc assumptions prevalent in official documents during the 1950s.
Such assessments rarely placed financial flows to the colonies in comparison with
the local self-financing of development, probably because, in the 1950s, colonial
economic development was no longer a British priority. Moreover, the lack of terri­
torial differentiation led to a considerable distortion of ad hoc assessments, which
was particularly pronounced with regard to West Africa and Malaya. Moreover, most
of the flows to the colonies occurred in the early 1950s, but dried up later. For a gen­
eral survey, see chapter 3.9
The Sterling Empire and
the International Economy:
Frictions with Cosmopolitan
Britain, 1958 and Beyond
The periphery related in a different way to the international economy
under conditions of liberal multilateralism. These changes and Britain’s
modified requirements when embarking on the new cosmopolitanism
diminished the economic complementarity between Britain and her (for­
mer) empire. The situation was aggravated by new policy designs of states
on the periphery in view of their economic development and foreign eco­
nomic relations. The more forceful political manifestation of these new
states and some of the old colonies reflected greater differentiation in politi­
cal organization and social and economic transformations. The drive to
peripheral development changed financial institutions on the periphery
and undermined British financial control. Britain needed to anticipate dam­
age arising from the imperial legacy. British policy focused on preventing
abrupt changes in the familiar areas of currency arrangements and trade
policies, on avoiding new claims in development finance, and on securing
old political alliances. Ghana became the most delicate case. None the less,
this defensive strategy was only partly successful, and the (former) empire’s
relevance to Britain decreased. Even so, Britain was able to avoid an emer­
gency that might have resulted from non-cooperation in the sterling area
by the periphery. Historical research on the empire has so far given little
attention to this important transformation in the late 1950s. Most studies
have focused on nationalism as the turning point in the colonies’ relation­
ship with Britain. 1 However, one contemporary symposium assembled eco­
nomic research on the impact of convertibility on the sterling area and the
likely future policies of overseas members. 2 In addition, there is a host of
mainly contemporary research that explores economic technicalities and
also touches upon the political aspects of economic development. 3 By inte­
grating this analysis with Britain’s external economic relations one can
gauge why Britain and the periphery pursued separate routes after 1958.
168The Sterling Empire and the International Economy 169
1. The periphery and liberal multilateralism
Liberal multilateralism after 1957–8 prompted direct and indirect changes
in sterling area relationships. These pertained to the regulation of financial
transactions, and to the direction of capital exports and trade flows. More­
over, the convertibility of currencies greatly increased aspirations among
the (ex-)colonial periphery and the sterling Commonwealth to loosen cer­
tain ties with the British economy. The mounting influence of doctrines of
economic development of the ‘Third World’ and the continuing sterling
crises of the early 1960s heightened this desire, though not necessarily the
feasibility of its realization. Naturally, the potential impact of this transfor­
mation was more significant in territories that had hitherto experienced lit­
tle economic liberalization, such as the Gold Coast/Ghana, Nigeria, and to
a lesser extent Malaya. 4
For the sterling periphery as a whole, convertibility was a significant break
with the past. There were few incentives left thereafter to pool foreign
exchange. Conversion into hard currencies, notably dollars, also became the
function of the equal treatment of foreign countries with regard to exchange
rules without a territory leaving the sterling area. Not least, convertibility
was closely associated with moves towards greater trade liberalization. The
dollar area and Japan, which had been tightly monitored for hard currency
saving, became more accessible as import markets. 5 Developmental consid­
erations gave this trend added momentum. In South-East Asia and the
Caribbean in particular, geographical proximity to sources of capital goods
suggested alternative trade links. 6 Bound up with the new trading opportu­
nities and sterling’s continuing volatility was the ability of peripheral coun­
tries to diversify their reserves and to hold part of them in dollar securities.
By the late 1950s, certain sterling area countries, such as Ceylon, India and
Australia, already held considerable gold and dollar reserves, while Malaya,
Ghana and the colonies held none. 7 The inclination of the last group to
retain at least part of their dollar earnings, or to hold part of their reserves in
dollars, was therefore enhanced. 8 For the colonies and recent ex-colonies,
convertibility also implied that the withdrawal of accumulated sterling bal­
ances above a country’s reserve requirements was more likely. Meanwhile,
the sterling periphery had become increasingly wary of its ability to float
loans on the London money market because a widening of the access to
London’s capital market beyond the sterling area was implicit in Britain’s
new cosmopolitanism. 9 Development finance was now a matter of prime
concern.
Under conditions of sterling convertibility, the sterling periphery also
exhibited an increased tendency towards expansionist economic policies,
and required more resources. Peripheral countries were engaged in a
development push that responded to strong social pressures. In West Africa
internal pressures were marked, while income from cocoa exports was still170 Money and the End of Empire
considerable. In Malaya, the independence government needed to meet the
aspirations of the growing number of Malay rubber entrepreneurs in an envi­
ronment that was increasingly hostile to natural rubber. In general terms,
convertibility signalled a change towards greater freedom of expenditure
after long periods of austerity. Import restrictions from hard currency areas
were dismantled. Import flows were reoriented towards the cheapest sources.
Development doctrines, aimed at encouraging the local private sector, advo­
cated managing imports with monetary and fiscal means rather than with
physical controls. The expansion of manufacturing also meant that protec­
tionist measures, when they were introduced, sheltered ‘infant’ industries
and thus differed from the trade regime in the discriminatory sterling area.
Finally, imperial preference, where it existed in the empire, had become
insignificant by the end of the 1950s. 10
The legacy of sterling relationships set constraints to the new economic
expansionism on the periphery. If a territory wished to withdraw sterling
balances that were not immediately liquid, it inevitably incurred a loss.
Special arrangements were required, if a territory left the sterling area. The
proper strategy from the periphery’s perspective was, therefore, to stay
within the area, but at the same time to increase the pressure on the ‘bank’,
namely Britain. Much of the rationale of the sterling area dissipated
with convertibility and growing trade liberalization. However, by the same
token, the sterling area became more attractive for members on the periph­
ery where and when Britain enabled them to benefit from liberalization.
But this diluted fundamental rules of the area, thus questioning its raison
d’être. 11
Meanwhile, the shortage of external finance, in conjunction with the
decline in world commodity prices in the late 1950s, enlarged the periphery’s
capital needs and heightened tendencies to use accumulated resources.
The periphery became more inclined to run balance of payments deficits
and to recast orthodox monetary arrangements in order to finance eco­
nomic growth. The case of Ghana illustrates this well. 12 Moreover, the
problem of securing development finance prompted peripheral countries
to broaden their sources of loans and aid. US trade with Britain’s (former)
empire in tropical Africa remained negligible. None the less, aid from the
United States was on the increase. 13 Tying aid to US exports and encouraging
the holding of dollars for reserve purposes were part and parcel of US eco­
nomic diplomacy on the periphery. Ceylon had been a success story in that
respect in the early 1950s. 14 Germany became another alternative to
Britain, for example, for Ghana and later Nigeria. 15
After 1957–8, the bond with the sterling area became governed largely
by the periphery’s concerns with a stable currency and with the ability to
import capital. However, when advantages in that respect became doubtful,
the periphery adhered to the sterling group merely because it lacked valu­
able alternatives. 16 Some peripheral countries had additional reasons to beThe Sterling Empire and the International Economy 171
wary of developments in the Anglo-European relationship. 17 The role which
the periphery played in Britain’s external economic relations thus became
redefined; first, because of developments on the periphery, and second
because of Britain’s modified needs.
2. The liberalizing periphery and cosmopolitan Britain
Changes in the position of the periphery in the world economy acted as an
impediment to Britain’s attempts to solidify once again a place for the pound
as an international currency. With convertibility, the sterling area’s dollar
pool lost its relevance. But convertibility did not put an end to the need for
import restraint in the sterling area. Although the pre-1958 sterling periph­
ery had become less important, it could still smooth Britain’s transition to
cosmopolitanism. British policy-makers hoped that economic development
on the periphery would take place in a cautious, ‘orthodox’ way, that is,
without impeding the established monetary arrangements and also by
retaining a rural and agricultural focus. The periphery continued to fulfil an
important function with respect to monetary management, through the link
to sterling and the holding of reserves exclusively in sterling. 18
None the less, in the late 1950s, the reduction in commodity prices
burdened the balance of payments of the overseas sterling area. At the
same time, cosmopolitanism effectively divested Britain of the ability to
impose general import restraint by the periphery, 19 and made it expedient
to hold part of the reserves in other currencies than sterling. Where periph­
eral countries continued to hold sterling, their support was linked solely to
the performance of sterling. While previously holding reserves other than
sterling implied both an arrangement with the dollar pool and an
infringement of good conduct in the sterling area, now only the latter
applied. 20 Further down the road to liberal multilateralism, such good con­
duct was challenged by the growing irrelevance of restrictions on non-ster-
ling capital imports towards the periphery. In the end, cosmopolitanism
also did away with the imperial periphery’s special title to credits by mere
virtue of its status as a member of the sterling area. 21 Significantly, the
propensity of British capital exports to gravitate to the sterling area
changed as new areas became more easily accessible to British investors.
However, after 1958, the financial requirements of countries on the sterling
periphery soared, and became even greater if the country concerned was
expected to forgo withdrawing sterling balances. British development cred­
its constituted the necessary quid pro quo of sterling area relationships. Yet,
in practice such demands were in conflict with Britain’s cosmopolitan
ambitions because her ability to provide capital exports was tight and
governed by different priorities. 22
In this situation, Britain required external finance for sterling area devel­
opment in order to reduce demands on the overstretched London money172 Money and the End of Empire
market. However, such aid also undermined sterling area arrangements –
especially if it was tied to exports by the creditor country. The reorientation
of trade after convertibility was in itself an impeding factor for Britain’s
international payments settlements. Such developments were in general
slow, though if one takes the period from the late 1950s to the early 1970s
one can observe in many (ex-)colonies a marked shift in trade away from
Britain. 23 The competitiveness of British exports, too, was affected by the
widening of import markets for the periphery. The glue that had bound the
trade of the sterling periphery closely to Britain from the late 1940s down
to the mid-1950s dissolved after 1958. Yet, even a radical move by Britain
herself away from the sterling area, while blocking overseas sterling
balances for example, was not feasible: it would have hastened this erosion
and also have dented the international credibility of the pound. 24
The most worrying development for Britain was the trend in economies
on the sterling periphery towards independent dollar reserves. This
undermined the very basis of sterling as an international currency and was
an indisputable sign of its fading appeal. Previously, Britain easily dis­
missed demands by the periphery for diversifying reserves towards dollar
holdings as being psychologically inspired and economically unsound. At
the beginning of the 1960s, however, a possible diversification of reserves
carried greater conviction with independent economic observers. 25
At the end of the 1950s, the complementary management of the British
economy and economies on the imperial sterling periphery ceased to
function. Britain’s postwar cosmopolitanism could not tolerate peripheral
expansionism and large-scale liberalization because the recovery of sterling
and Britain’s economy remained fragile. Ideally, Britain required the
following conditions on the periphery: balance of payments surpluses,
import restraint, at least a temporary check on capital demands, limitations
on the withdrawal of sterling balances and prosperous sellers’ markets.
However, this was far more than she could hope for. 26 The ideal sterling
area country no longer existed, with the possible exception of some Middle
Eastern oil producers and Brunei. 27
After 1958, any positive role that countries of the sterling Commonwealth
previously played for Britain became effectively redefined as merely a lack of
impediment. Among the ‘old’ Commonwealth countries, Australia aimed at
economic expansion and at extending her trade relations with East Asia,
notably Japan. The relevance of her link with the sterling area, therefore,
decreased. Australia was confident to achieve a balance of payments equilib­
rium with hard currency markets to make good for the dollar pool alloca­
tions from which she had benefited considerably in the past. 28 India, by
contrast, was favourably inclined towards the sterling area as long as her ster­
ling balances were not blocked. She benefited from a stable currency, and, by
mutual agreement, had been allowed to draw down her huge balances since
the early 1950s within the framework of the Colombo development plan.The Sterling Empire and the International Economy 173
Moreover, since the late war period India had been granted a concession
that in essence went against the rationale of the group, namely she was
allowed to keep some of her own gold reserves rather than pooling them in
London. Furthermore, by the end of the 1950s, Commonwealth preference,
which might have prejudiced India’s import priorities, hardly mattered any
more. 29
Likewise, dependent territories, such as the Federation of Rhodesia
and Nyasaland, Kenya or the West Indies, had no reason to oppose the
maintenance of the status quo in sterling area relations. However, apart
from their limited role as markets for British capital exports, these territo­
ries had not sustained the sterling area and were unlikely to play a greater
role under liberal multilateralism. 30 The Federation had benefited from
huge capital inflows from the London market and from private investors,
while suffering hardly any restrictions on hard currency imports. 31 Kenya
too had been privileged in hard currency imports and borrowing. 32 The
West Indies had been granted major concessions in trade with the dollar
area, and had some interest in preferential agreements that protected her
banana exports, which were not competitive in dollar markets. 33
But the economies of the previously pivotal areas of the sterling area
came into mounting conflict with Britain’s economic objectives. By the end
of the 1950s, Malaya’s balance of payments had slipped into deficit.
At the same time, the Malayan economy aimed at diversification and
expansion, which implied a rise in demands for loans from the London
market. In the long run, therefore, an increase in the rate at which accumu­
lated sterling balances were drawn down – notably the considerable
Malayan government funds – was expected. Moreover, important capital
goods were now sought from the cheapest bidder, usually Japan or the
United States, and preferential Commonwealth arrangements were dis­
banded in 1959. 34 Similarly, in Nigeria a trend was implicit in economic
development that increased demands for loans and the withdrawal of bal­
ances. During the 1960s, Nigerian trade also moved away from Britain. In
1958, import licensing with the dollar area and Japan was abandoned.
Eventually, import control became re-established in the early 1960s mainly
to protect Nigeria’s emerging manufacturing sector. 35 Ghana’s economy
too went into an expansionary phase after independence in 1957. Ghana’s
development plan was highly ambitions. Manufacturing and the private
sector were boosted by the dismantling of import restrictions. Infrastruc­
tural projects, notably the long-held dream of the Volta dam, required huge
investment. In the virtual absence of opportunities for external borrowing,
and hampered by decreasing cocoa earnings, development was financed
from reserves. As a result, by 1961, serious reserve problems joined a deteri­
orating balance of payments. Certain borrowing options then emerged
which, during the 1960s, were used to finance the deficit rather than to
foster development. 36 Moreover, Ghana’s imports from non-sterling sources174 Money and the End of Empire
increased from the mid-1950s, and the EEC became a major market for its
cocoa exports. It was evident that Ghana would be hard hit by any restric­
tions on her exports resulting from any future association of ex-colonies
with the European common market, notably by the competition with
cocoa exports of the Ivory Coast. 37 The general trend, as these cases show,
was for ties between (ex-)colonial economies and the sterling area to
loosen.
3. States on the periphery change
The states on the imperial sterling periphery also underwent important
changes after 1957. In that year, Britain granted formal independence
to two of the pillars of the sterling area, the Gold Coast (as Ghana) and
Malaya. Convertibility at the end of 1958, moreover, indirectly prompted
certain institutional arrangements to become modified. Independence and
multilateralism did not necessarily imply immediate institutional change.
The main thrust of these changes was felt only in the course of the 1960s.
However, some important transformations originated in the late 1950s and
were anticipated by British policy-makers. 38
Currency convertibility and trade liberalization on the one hand, and pol­
itical autonomy on the other, affected the peripheral state’s control of the
economic realm. Convertibility modified peripheral economic management
and facilitated economic expansion. Access to non-sterling markets and
capital became easier. The peripheral state obtained greater flexibility in the
use of foreign exchange. In conjunction with economic expansion, convert­
ibility also indirectly undermined import control, and the independence
of colonies thwarted the provision of colonial finance via inter-colonial
borrowing. Furthermore, economic expansion increased pressure on the
currency boards by generating an increase in demands for development
finance and local credit arrangements.
In principle, political autonomy also transferred economic management
to the former colony. This step implied that institutional arrangements
might be altered. In the realm of trade, political autonomy empowered the
former colony to control import protection, within the limits of compliance
with international agreements. Moreover, ex-colonies could withdraw their
business from the Crown Agents. In addition, of course, ex-colonies achi­
eved policy autonomy over monetary and financial institutions. As a result,
substantial changes in the currency board system and marketing board
arrangements became possible.
In reality, political autonomy did not trigger rapid institutional change.
Abrupt changes in institutional arrangements and monetary policy had
certain drawbacks, and the restructuring was in most cases gradual. 39 Even
so, the divisions between Britain’s needs in foreign economic relations
on the one hand, and the nature of socio-economic constellations andThe Sterling Empire and the International Economy 175
objectives of political elites on the periphery on the other hand, widened.
Control by former colonial states over such issues as the membership of the
sterling area, the currency cover and the withdrawal of accumulated sterling
balances was constrained by structural and circumstantial factors, and con­
siderations of development policy. In some cases, the very size of the ster­
ling balances constituted an obstacle to any sudden change in allegiance to
sterling. Moreover, central bank provisions, as the legal legacies of the colo­
nial state, were designed to impede easy changes in the monetary domain.
The expected economic expansion made an absolute reduction of the cur­
rency holdings also inadvisable, especially at a time of growing export prob­
lems and acute shortages of capital. Local credit creation had its limits too.
Furthermore, the inherited liquidity structure of the colonial investment
portfolio, combined with high British interest rates, were barriers to disin-
vestment. 40 At the same time, there was no way in which an (ex-)colony
could influence Britain’s priorities in granting access to the London money
market. Formal independence did not change Britain’s central position as
the banker of the sterling periphery. Moreover, ‘moral’ pressure and appeals
to Britain’s responsibilities for financial assistance that a colony might have
been able to exert on her were now meaningless. The leverage in the
provision of capital thus depended on available alternatives which the
periphery could use to defy Britain. Some alternatives existed. But, given
the general liquidity problem of the international economy, the bulk of
alternative capital flows did not go to the newly independent sterling
periphery either. 41
Yet, on the other hand, international liberalization and the political
autonomy of the periphery had the potential of unsettling established
economic relationships with Britain. Economic planning now aimed at the
creation of national economies and the management of economic growth
within the peripheral state. The precise effects of such management on
Britain depended on the employed development strategy. The periphery’s
growing concern was import protection, because these countries mainly
exported raw materials and semi-manufactured goods, which put them at
a disadvantage in terms of tariffs vis-à-vis finished products that now
dominated trade between industrialized countries. Certain development spe­
cialists advocated a growth strategy that included industrialization while
accepting the consequences of a deteriorating balance of payments. Policy
requirements included preferential access to developed markets and the pro­
tection of ‘infant’ industries, while still attempting to attract private capital
imports. Others advocated an autarky model, similar to that favoured by
Fabian socialism, emphasizing state agency, a gradual development of agri­
culture, self-reliance, and were largely sceptical of foreign investment.
Peripheral development also actively involved monetary institutions in
pre-financing domestic commercial operations, which was not feasible
under British colonial monetary arrangements. Finally, some of the new176 Money and the End of Empire
developmentalists saw a role for central banking in development, albeit a
cautious one, where central banks took on functions of commercial banking
in order to foster the emergence of an indigenous banking system, and by
pre-financing projects in the productive sectors of the economy. 42
As a result, pressure for concessions within the sterling area grew and
increased claims on British resources. Peripheral states tabled demands that
Britain was hesitant to meet, notably on the delicate questions of holding
dollar reserves or compensating holders of balances for losses they incurred
from disinvestment. 43 In addition, the new peripheral expansionism con­
trasted sharply with the developmental orthodoxies adhered to by the
British. Colonial economic policy had emphasized export-led growth via
commodity production, whereas the new policies promoted manufactur-
ing. 44 Development along such lines, in the long run, implied demands
from the periphery for adjustments in international trade arrangements,
jeopardized export flows from the developed world and ultimately created
new competitors for Britain in old markets. 45
In the late 1950s, a long-term transformation in sterling relationships was
anticipated in Malaya, the Gold Coast/Ghana and Nigeria. In Malaya, the
British were able to cooperate with the previously economically marginal­
ized ethnic Malays, whose entrepreneurial influence was still limited, and
who constituted the main nationalist movement, the United Malays
National Organization (UMNO). However, during the 1950s, this group
had been the commercial elite in the making, and after independence its
policies were less in tune with British expectations of smooth and conflict-
free economic development. In Malaya, institutional change continued to
be slow and policy changes were gradual, while the entrepôt centre of
Singapore, where urban Chinese entrepreneurs exerted the main political
influence, benefited from existing sterling arrangements. But changes were
bound to come. The Malayan five-year development plan (1961–5) required
a greater use of resources. With such a step the fiduciary issue was eventu­
ally bound to be used. Moreover, by 1961 the legal basis for issuing currency
was in place, as were provisions that allowed the reserves to diversify
beyond sterling securities. Furthermore, though Malaya’s expansion moved
more cautiously than Ghana’s, Malaya became increasingly anxious to
retain investment within the country, to support local credit institutions,
and to boost a local securities market that accommodated growth.
Investment in industry became actively promoted by central bank involve­
ment in early 1960, when the Malayan Industrial Development Finance Ltd
(MIDF) was founded. Hitherto, private investment flowed abroad because
investment in the previously thriving commodities rubber and tin became
less profitable and other investment outlets hardly existed. However, in the
1960s Malaysia (Malaya before 1963) based economic expansion on its
long-standing commodity, rubber. The backbone of the economy soon
became the vast section of expanding Malay smallholders rather than theThe Sterling Empire and the International Economy 177
expatriate estates. This marked a radical shift from the colonial period.
Malaysia pursued initiatives combining natural rubber production with the
manufacturing of rubber products, thereby dodging the adverse trend on
the world market for natural rubber. This development was successful in the
1960s and 1970s, when Malaysia became one of Asia’s rapidly growing
economies. 46
In Nigeria too internal political divisions delayed pressures on Britain
for institutional changes, while existing economic ties weakened. Still,
requirements for envisaged development plans and the reorientation of
economic development towards industrialization indirectly heightened
demands for borrowing and strained monetary arrangements and
reserves. 47 As a regulative measure, therefore, the central bank, which the
British formally established in 1959, phased in a reduction of the currency
cover. 48 Then, in the aftermath of the country’s independence in late 1960,
Nigeria’s Central Bank Act was amended with regard to provisions concern­
ing, among others, the holding of non-sterling reserves. By the time of the
sterling crises of 1961, Nigeria took the practical step of moving some of
her reserves into dollars. 49 Both Nigeria and Ghana, in 1962, defined their
currencies no longer in terms of sterling but in ounces of fine gold. 50
Ghana pressed for rapid institutional change, attempting to dismantle the
shackles of the sterling area while retaining its advantages. Her relationship
with Britain was rather delicately poised in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
Since Ghana was denied access to the London money market, she began to
finance her deteriorating balance of payments from accumulated sterling
balances. This was not possible without incurring losses, given the liquidity
structure of Ghana’s portfolio (mostly long-term securities) and the interest
rate in Britain at the time. 51 Ghana urged Britain to compensate her for
such losses, and repeatedly threatened to leave the sterling area. Moreover,
as in the case of Nigeria, Ghana’s Central Bank Act was amended in 1961 to
permit the holding of non-sterling reserves. The situation was aggravated by
the fact that flows from Britain to the Gold Coast/Ghana from loans,
CD&W and private investment continued to be a trifle by comparison. 52 In
addition, because of the lack of an indigenous banking system, the pressure
on Ghana’s central bank to take up commercial banking functions
remained strong at the end of the 1950s. However, radical challenges of the
sterling area did not assist the internal restructuring of the financial sector.
Importantly, Ghana’s economic expansion under the Nkrumah government
relied on expatriate business. The CPP government did not encourage the
rise of a strong indigenous entrepreneurial class from the cocoa-producing
regions. The government feared this would strengthen the Ashanti opposi­
tion rather than its own ranks. The government abolished the marketing
boards in 1958 in an attempt to exert greater control over the cocoa sector,
and used cocoa income to finance development. 53 Later the government
regulated cocoa marketing by a state committee of clerks, small traders and178 Money and the End of Empire
secondary school leavers, in a thinly veiled attempt of keeping cocoa mer­
chants in the Ashanti region at bay. From 1961, international firms were
excluded from the buying process. In 1964–5, the government, rather than
the cocoa merchants, even launched a cocoa boycott against international
firms, explicitly using the historical precedent of the 1930s as a public rela­
tions exercise to promote the Volta dam project. Imports of capital goods
were stepped up in line with these development priorities, while severe
balance of payments deficits became a persistent problem during the 1960s.
Ghana could prevent the devaluation of its currency in 1961 only by
reimposing massive import restrictions. 54 On the whole, colonial institu­
tions crumbled and any positive benefit Britain and the sterling area
derived from Ghana vanished rapidly as Ghana’s policies contradicted the
sterling area rationale and the country remained a member of the sterling
area merely by name.
4. The policies of cosmopolitan Britain towards the periphery
Between 1957 and 1959, British policy pursued a more elaborate monitoring
of the reduction of colonial sterling balances, colonial investment portfolios,
and the institutions that were critical for monetary relations. Moreover, the
British attempted to maintain traditional trade flows. They also made an
effort to restructure aid arrangements and to postpone capital exports to an
unspecified date, while retaining the periphery’s allegiance to the sterling
group. By the beginning of the 1960s, British attention shifted more defen­
sively towards securing the link of peripheral currencies to sterling and
allaying trends towards the diversification of reserves towards the dollar. In
addition, Britain aimed at fostering political ties with the remaining empire
through specific technical assistance and sporadic aid as and when she saw
fit. In doing so, Britain became more closely bound up with the United
States’ ‘Cold War’ strategy. By this time, the territorial preoccupations of
earlier periods had completely dissipated as the thrust of British foreign eco­
nomic policy moved away from the sterling periphery towards Europe and
North America. 55 On the sterling periphery, the territorial focus of British
policy in the late 1950s continued to lie in Ghana, Malaya and Nigeria. But
pressures on British resources were also likely to rise in colonies, such as
Kenya and the West Indies.
Arguably the most serious policy crisis with a member of the sterling
periphery during the 1950s occurred with respect to the Gold Coast on
the eve of the territory’s independence as Ghana in March 1957. The crisis
pertained to the Nkrumah government’s threat to leave the sterling area
and to retain the country’s dollar earnings unless British development aid
was forthcoming. This situation even led British politicians to consider
delaying the Gold Coast’s independence. Some activists in the Gold Coast
felt duped when they realized how problematic the withdrawal of sterlingThe Sterling Empire and the International Economy 179
balances was, considering the liquidity structure of the country’s investment
portfolio. 56 The British, by their own admission, had few convincing
counter-arguments. The strongest were the technical difficulties for Ghana
in trying to administer its own exchange controls, and the general credibility
problem the country might face in foreign money markets as a result of
leaving the area. On the other hand, misconduct in the sterling area was said
to prejudice Ghana’s future access to the London market and private capital
flows from Britain. Sterling’s problems, it was suggested, were merely tempo­
rary and the Gold Coast should show restraint in withdrawing balances until
these difficulties had subsided. 57 Britain’s persuasiveness was not increased
by the fact that CD&W was discontinued after independence. 58 Eventually,
the crisis faded largely because Ghana shied away from the consequences of
so radical a move. 59 But the climate in Anglo-Ghanaian relations remained
tense thereafter.
In late 1957, Ghana started exploratory talks on removing its London
investments from the Crown Agents’ management. The British realized
that the CA’s role in administering (ex-)colonial funds was bound to diminish
or end before long. The Bank of England attempted to appease Ghanaian
demands by stressing its concern for Ghana’s self-interest and closely
watched moves by Ghana on her balances and investment management. 60
The Bank’s stance was helped by certain technicalities: Ghana’s currency
funds were at that time still part of the West African Currency Board rather
than the Ghanaian central bank, and an independent body, not the gov­
ernment of Ghana, formally controlled the marketing board funds. 61 Then,
in early 1958, the Bank of England discovered to its satisfaction that
Ghana’s withdrawal of balances (that had taken place throughout 1957)
had come to a halt. 62 It seemed that Ghana, during 1958, was consolidat­
ing its policy and its position towards the IMF. The British, for once, were
confident that the IMF members addressed by Ghana were sterling sup­
porters and tensions would thus be eased. 63 Otherwise, the Bank of
England was alarmed by Ghana’s possible move into the dollar for reserve
purposes. 64 But, these concerns notwithstanding, Britain refused to make
concessions towards development finance. The Bank, in 1958, politely
made it plain to Ghana that she could not expect the London market to
provide loans to bridge the period until the country’s long-term securities
had matured. 65
The debate about Ghana’s sterling area membership resurfaced towards
the end of 1960. The arguments used by Britain look like a rerun of those
in 1957. This time Britain was able to rely on the support of the expatriate
governor of the Bank of Ghana. He alerted the Ghanaian government
to the risks of further losses from liquidating securities, for capital inflows
and future borrowing, as well as to the need for Ghana’s currency to
be linked to a major international currency. 66 Ultimately, policy-makers
regained confidence that they could overcome this crisis, too. 67 Ghana’s180 Money and the End of Empire
underlying problems were unlikely to be remedied by a rapid move against
the sterling area since they were bound up with the continuing tensions
about domestic credit facilities. As in the early 1950s, the Bank of England
offered the Nkrumah government arguments to this effect. 68
With respect to Malaya, which became independent in August 1957,
British officials were confident that the government was unlikely to precip­
itate rapid withdrawals of balances and radical changes in monetary
arrangements. Britain’s record of lending to Malaya from the London
market was slightly better than in the Gold Coast/Ghana, for example.
However, CD&W was discontinued upon Malayan independence, too. 69 At
the end of the decade Malaya also pressed for a substantial loan which
was continuously delayed, for which the Bank Rate provided a convenient
excuse. 70 Similar to Ghana, though less forcefully, the Malayan Federation
wished to improve its borrowing prospects in exchange for a pledge to
protect sterling area reserves and hard currency expenditure. 71
Yet, the British feared that favourable political conditions in Malaya were
unlikely to last. 72 They attempted to prolong the status quo by influencing
monetary management and central bank arrangements. But in 1957, Britain
was already in no doubt that Malaya would eventually diversify her reserves
towards the dollar, if sterling area conditions continued to be unfavourable.
Anyway, this was the logical step following the diversification of the
imports of capital goods from dollar markets and Japan, as British exporters
seemed to be unable to capture the Malayan market. 73 However, Britain’s
achievements in 1959 surpassed her expectations of 1957. The new
Malayan central bank took on banking functions while leaving the currency
board unimpeded. 74 The future of currency matters was left to be decided
by the renegotiation of the Malaya/Borneo currency agreement in 1960.
Moreover, the British trusted the continuing influence of expatriate eco­
nomic advisers in fostering a common central bank and currency in the
Federation of Malaya and Singapore in order to facilitate domestic trade.
Any final solution in currency matters was drawn out with this aim in
mind. 75 Meanwhile, however, demands for a 50 per cent fiduciary issue had
come firmly on the agenda. In addition, Malaya advocated that the cur­
rency board should be allowed to invest in dollar securities if all the partici­
pating countries of the board agreed. 76 This became the greatest obstacle to
the 1960 agreement, whereas the fiduciary issue clause was conceded with­
out much debate. The Bank of England adviser put his case strongly that, if
Malaya’s currency was pegged to sterling, it was only appropriate for her to
hold reserves exclusively in sterling. In the end, Britain conceded the diver­
sification clause. But the matter caused such debate that even British
Treasury officials felt the delay might have damaged Britain’s reputation in
Malaya beyond repair. 77
British policy considerations in Nigeria resembled those in Malaya and
Ghana. However, Britain was able to exert somewhat greater influence inThe Sterling Empire and the International Economy 181
Nigeria, notably through the constitutional conference of 1957. Britain’s
principal policy aims were twofold: to phase in a central bank and a
Nigerian currency that maintained the hallmarks of traditional sterling area
relationships, and to keep claims for development finance in check. The
Treasury was adamant that CD&W money should not be wasted on Nigeria
after the country’s independence. 78 The Colonial Office (kept in the dark by
the Bank of England on the volatility of trustee arrangements) impressed on
Nigeria the necessity of guaranteeing loans so that the country’s trustee
status could be continued after independence. 79 The Office also told Nigeria
in 1958 that her development requirements could be met from her own
resources without access to the London money market. 80 Furthermore,
Britain bent over backwards to avoid shouldering incalculable risks with
regard to loans that Nigeria wished to obtain from the IBRD. 81 Eventually,
Britain tied her own guarantee to the IBRD to a pledge by the Nigerian gov­
ernment not to seek finance from the London money market. 82 With regard
to currency matters, a Bank of England adviser prepared the statutes for a
Nigerian central bank in 1957. The Bank, which started operation in July
1959, in principle continued the currency board mechanism. 83 In view of
the financial pressure on London, the central bank provided for the
gradual introduction of a fiduciary issue of 40 per cent over five years,
which thereafter could be extended to a maximum of 60 per cent. However,
there was no provision that reserves could be held in other than sterling
securities. 84
Meanwhile, colonial monetary arrangements also came under considerable
strain from Kenya. In 1958, the colony was granted an increase to 30 per
cent of the East African Currency Board’s fiduciary issue. 85 Kenya already
benefited disproportionately from loans from the London money market. 86
Her privileged position continued in the framework of the 1959 CD&W
arrangements, namely through the Exchequer loans scheme, and stood in
notable contrast to Nigeria, where the bulk of assistance shifted to export
credits to be made available after independence. 87 But Kenya sought addi­
tional finance by realizing colonial securities. Some British officials
thought this was an appropriate move that would decrease pressure from
Kenya for development finance. However, the Bank of England and the
Treasury were apprehensive of the move’s expected destabilizing influence
on the market for colonial securities as a whole, and suspended Kenyan
disinvestment. 88
5. Damage limitation
Britain’s policy towards the main (ex-)colonies Ghana, Malaya and Nigeria,
between 1957 and the beginning of the 1960s, can be explained by two
basic sets of factors. First, sustaining sterling convertibility and boosting
cosmopolitanism entailed difficulties. The marked improvement in Britain’s182 Money and the End of Empire
balance of payments in 1958 did not last, while constraints from outside
the sterling area persisted. Concerns over capital exports prompted policy-
makers to be anxious of developments that might require even relatively
minor expenditures. Therefore, policy was preoccupied with protective mea­
sures concerning the sterling area, checks on sterling balances, borrowing
arrangements and central bank provisions. Second, specific local circum­
stances prompted Britain to be wary of import liberalization and expansion­
ist policies on the sterling periphery. The need to check demands on British
resources by structural and quasi-legal means and by influencing policy
remained crucial. 89
The maintenance of established trade was important for the success of a
reformed sterling area because alternative trade flows had the potential of
enhancing the dollar as an international means of exchange. Moreover, any
radical redirection of trade disrupted Britain’s international payments flows
and might have delayed the recovery of her balance of payments. The open­
ing of trade towards dollar markets, notably by Malaya and the ‘old’ sterling
Commonwealth, came at a highly critical moment, when sterling became
convertible. The British pleaded for continued import restraint and for
maintaining sterling area arrangements. But British officials could do little
to influence change. Some attempts for mitigation were made, however.
Certain initiatives in the late 1950s promoted British exports in capital
goods to the sterling periphery in areas where Britain increasingly lost out
to European, United States, or Japanese competitors. Britain also took up
Ghana’s case to fend off expected restrictions for importers from overseas
that were not associated with the EEC. Britain wished to counter the loss of
important earnings for Ghana’s balance of payments, but also to pre-empt
illiberal trade policies. The closing of the dollar gap meant that the impor­
tance of hard currency earning by the sterling periphery as an aim in itself
had decreased by the late 1950s. However, at the same time, Britain’s fear of
protectionism and balance of payments problems in the ex-colonial sterling
periphery grew. 90
With regard to rescinding sterling area membership, British policy-makers
were particularly anxious in 1957–8 that Ghana might take this course.
They expected a knock-on effect, especially on Malaya, but also on colonies
such as Nigeria and the West Indies. 91 Moreover, such a step might well
impede Britain’s move towards the convertibility of sterling, of which any
further delay (even more so if the reasons were plain to see) might deal ster­
ling the final blow. On the other hand, British policy also operated under
conditions of incomplete information and some fears were not borne out in
practice. There existed obstacles to Ghana’s withdrawal of balances in terms
of liquidity and distribution of funds which gave British policy-makers
unexpected leverage, as they discovered during 1958. None the less, techni­
cal leverage sometimes heightened political tension. When it turned out,
at the end of the 1950s, that withdrawals of balances were gradual, BritishThe Sterling Empire and the International Economy 183
policy was less afraid that Ghana and other ex-colonies would leave
the area. Yet, in 1961 some concerns re-emerged along similar lines to the
1957–8 period. 92
The currency and central bank provisions which Britain encouraged
during the period also fulfilled the purpose of keeping claims on British
resources in check and of preserving sterling area relationships. Where these
measures converged with emerging independent strategies on peripheral
development, this was by coincidence rather than by design. Britain’s
concern did not lie with the management of peripheral national economies
in their own right. 93 The Bank of England conceded a controlled reduction
of balances in order to reduce risks for the British economy in the long
term, notably by further enlarging fiduciary issues. Britain had little choice
in that respect, if she wished to contain pressures that arose from the acute
shortages in development finance without also stepping up assistance.
However, whenever central banks began to play an active role in economic
development, they moved away from the model advocated by the Bank of
England. Britain was uncompromising with respect to the central banks’
investment options, be it as a local agent of development, which might
invite inflationary policies, or be it with respect to investment outside
sterling, which undermined sterling’s international role. The only tolerable
exceptions were the regional financial and entrepôt centres of Hong Kong
and Kuwait. 94
At the same time, Britain did not increase capital exports to the former
pillars of the (ex-)colonial periphery to sustain the political cohesion of the
sterling group. She was unable to do so when implementing convertibility,
given her continuing balance of payments and reserve problems. Moreover,
sterling internationalists were anxious that British capital exports went to
areas where they played a useful role in supporting Britain’s multilateral
payments arrangements. This was not the case in territories that held
high sterling balances. In the face of mounting pressure, policy-makers
remained firm on one of the few policy options they controlled and
did not concede compensatory borrowing from the London money mar-
ket. 95 Wherever possible, the British aimed at arrangements under which
peripheral countries would shoulder their own responsibilities with respect
to their creditworthiness. Moreover, although the general situation on
the London money market improved during 1959, the Bank of England
rejected any loan for Ghana because it would further weaken the market
for colonial loans, already under pressure from Kenya. 96 When, in 1960,
Ghana suggested a multilateral Commonwealth convention to replace the
trustee arrangements and to enhance borrowing prospects on the London
market, the Bank was favourable to such a proposal. This would prompt
the realization that the Colonial Stock Acts were illusory, without making
new commitments on the part of the British government. 97 Otherwise,
British policy focused on export credits instead of other forms of loans,184 Money and the End of Empire
especially in areas in which a country’s long-term allegiance to Britain was
in doubt. 98
Britain’s attitude towards political developments in the (former) pivots of
the imperial periphery reflects the principal concerns linked to her foreign
economic relations and important socio-economic changes. On the whole,
Britain was fortunate with the existing political constellation, even if by
that time her influence was limited in shaping economic growth strategies
on the periphery. Containment on the periphery was possible because not
only Britain but also the periphery were constrained in their actions. For
Britain, any radical step, such as the blocking of balances, was no longer
feasible because of the inevitable loss of confidence in sterling. 99 But
for the periphery, too, economic expansion was hampered by structural
factors, which curtailed radical political challenges. To some extent,
the British were, therefore, able to retain political ‘allies’, if sometimes
against the latter’s political design. Yet, these alliances now served merely
defensive purposes of slowing down institutional change, became increas­
ingly irrelevant in terms of Britain’s overall conception in foreign economic
policy, or followed a rationale that was different from the earlier sterling
area policies.
In Ghana, despite the assertive stance of the government, no formal
break with Britain occurred, although the economic relationship eroded.
The nationalist CPP was the result of delicate coalition-building by a
heterogeneous elite that, moreover, had a legitimization problem because it
was a political force largely separate from the merchant farmers. This situa­
tion also characterized independent Ghana. The CPP government profited
from acquiring the ‘political kingdom’, but was also trapped between the
feasibility of economic expansion and challenges from cocoa interests,
which it duly proceeded to subdue. In fending off these difficulties the
Nkrumah government and Britain were even able to find common
ground. 100 However, Britain’s manoeuvring had reached an impasse. Sup­
porting Nkrumah against the indigenous economic elites was now more in
the interest of Nkrumah than of Britain, and served little purpose in secur­
ing Ghana’s performance and good behaviour in the sterling area. Ghana’s
cocoa exports still fetched unexpectedly high prices on the world market.
However, now these exports became the bone of contention between the
economic elite of the cocoa growers and the independence government in
its strive to foster national development rather than between the British
and various groups in Ghana. Unlike in Malaya, and even Kenya, in Ghana
commercial entrepreneurs did not prevail in the colonial state, which was at
least in part due to the legacy of British colonial policy in the Gold Coast.
Nigeria’s foreign economic relations also became transformed during
the 1960s. For example, Nigeria’s imports from Britain fell from 42.3 per
cent in 1960 to 23.1 per cent in 1974. Cocoa decreased sharply as an export
commodity, whereas vegetable oils remained important. However, petrolThe Sterling Empire and the International Economy 185
eventually promoted Nigerian economic development and industrialization
more than anything else. None the less, in the 1960s Nigeria was still pre­
occupied with internal regional divisions, culminating in the civil war in
the South which impeded economic development and was responsible for
the economic malaise of the late 1960s before the oil boom set in. Changes
in economic institutions were first only very gradual. 101
In Malaya, political collusion in the late 1950s was more important for
Britain than in Ghana, because Malaya held a particularly high percentage
of her investments in relatively liquid government funds. 102 Britain was
thus fortunate in benefiting from her strong alliance with the moderate
Malay independence movement led by UMNO. However, the smooth politi­
cal relations merely eased disputes over the sterling area legacy rather than
sustaining strong economic ties. The British expected the demise of natural
rubber, and the Malay smallholders began to embrace large commercial
agriculture. In the 1960s, the Malaysian government gradually introduced
trade and monetary policies that challenged the old orthodoxy of British
sterling area management. Trade protectionism was designed to support
Malaysian manufacturing. Diversification in trade went along with some
diversification in the reserves and measures by the central bank aimed at
preventing investment to flow abroad. 103
In Kenya, too, a notable transformation in socio-economic and political
constellations was meanwhile taking place. The community of white set­
tlers moved away from farming and increasingly into small manufacturing
enterprises. This strand of the white community became organized in the
United Kenya Party under Blundell and grew into an important political
force. At the same time, the indigenous Kikuyu entrepreneurial elite orga­
nized in KANU pushed further into the political arena. This group could
not be marginalized forever. The conflict potential between this group and
the white settlers now diminished, opening the way for a deal regarding
the key question of property rights in the Highlands. In a huge scheme, the
land was transferred from white farmers to Kikuyu agricultural entrepre­
neurs, with the participation of private British business and invest­
ment schemes. As a result, Britain was able to foster a new alliance with a
transformed settler elite and, albeit first very reluctantly, with the emerging
indigenous economic elite. Thus, an alliance between British entrepreneur
and investors on the one hand and the Kikuyu agricultural elite on the
other replaced the old cooperation between empire protectionists in Britain
and British settler farmers in Kenya. The changed overall context in the
sterling area also played a role (even if Kenya had always been a spe­
cial case) because the new alliances were in tune with Macmillan’s strand
of Conservatism, which was more inclined to support British manufac­
turing. What now became the backbone of overseas economic policy
were individual deals by British firms rather than a coherent sterling area
policy. 104186 Money and the End of Empire
When the formal changes on the ex-colonial sterling periphery occurred
and transformations became more visible in the 1960s, the whole
kaleidoscope of Britain’s external economic and political relations had
already taken a new pattern.
6. Conclusion
This and the previous chapter have argued that coherent economic relations
between Britain and the imperial sterling area disintegrated after 1957.
Moreover, Britain neither had the incentives to make concessions to her
(former) colonies to keep them in the sterling area in the long run, nor was
she any longer in a position to do so. This critical juncture in Britain’s rela­
tions with the periphery is largely neglected in historical research.
In the late 1950s, Britain attempted to re-establish sterling as the domi­
nant international currency. This overriding concern guided her policy
priorities in boosting the export of manufactures and in limiting and
redirecting capital exports. On the sterling periphery, Britain was anxious
to keep strains in check that ensued from economic liberalization, notably
those arising from the sterling balances and claims for development
finance. The European Common Market posed a threat by potentially
upsetting Britain’s payments settlements. Moreover, in 1958, British indus­
try became suddenly wary about its competitiveness on the continent.
Farfetched ambitions for cosmopolitan sterling foundered in 1961, when
Britain needed international support to save sterling from devaluation.
None the less, the Eurodollar market presented British financial circles with
a profitable avenue for promoting sterling cosmopolitanism at a smaller
scale.
In the (ex-)colonies, and notably in Ghana, Malaya and Nigeria, various
factors converged at the end of the 1950s that impeded the group’s earlier
function for Britain. International liberalization prompted economic expan­
sion. Pressures towards drawing down balances and expanding development
finance mounted. Balance of payments deficits resulted from the develop­
ment push and the simultaneous slump in world commodity prices.
Development strategies on the periphery emerged that conflicted with colo­
nial orthodoxies, notably by emphasizing growth strategies within national
economies and by advocating manufacturing. Not least new economic elites
made an impact on states on the periphery. By the early 1960s, these trends
had irrevocably set peripheral development and British external economic
relations on diverging courses.
Furthermore, the transformation that international economic liberalization
provoked in Britain’s imperial relations was not without hitches. The with­
drawal of sterling balances raised the question of investment liquidity and
financial compensation and added to volatility during the implementation
of sterling convertibility. Reduced balances also disrupted the self-sustainingThe Sterling Empire and the International Economy 187
mechanism of colonial finance via inter-colonial investment. Another
important source of colonial finance – the trustee scheme – fell victim to
the liberalization of Britain’s domestic financial system. Stresses on colonial
monetary institutions and the link with sterling increased at the end of the
1950s. None the less, although the complementarity in imperial economic
relations dissipated during the period, no sudden rupture occurred in terms
of economic organization and institutions. Change was drawn out, which
accommodated British concerns.
In the important (ex-)colonies, leverage in domestic economic policy
was limited and political constellations contained radical reform. The polit­
ical autonomy of Ghana and Malaya complicated the management of
economic relations on the sterling periphery. However, their independence
was not in itself consequential for Britain’s abandonment of empire.
Political developments that led to the end of the British empire were closely
interwoven with the changing legacy of economic relations discussed in
the present and preceding chapters. The final chapter will argue this case.

that demands for loans from Britain would increase once the bulk of the balances
had been spent. This in turn might lead to further strains on the currency and

marketing board funds of the (former) colonies and precipitate the ‘irresponsible’
management of those funds. The mere holding of balances in certain types of funds
was no longer seen as a sufficient guarantee of their maintenance, with the excep­
tion of sinking and certain banking funds. None the less, by that time the British
government had realized that the exit from the sterling area by several countries
simultaneously was unlikely, and that the inclination of (former) colonies to with­
draw funds before they had reached maturity was limited. Yet, policy-makers also
realized that the political desire on the periphery for rapid economic development
was inescapable; ‘gradualism’ could no longer be taken for granted. In this develop­
ment push additional self-financing would make up only a minor part, whereas the
bulk would come from the withdrawal of balances and, if available, from finance
raised outside the sterling area.

Issues. This document summarizes a technical but important concern of the Bank of
England with regard to the future of the functioning of colonial finances under con­
ditions of financial liberalization.
The table shows that the Crown Agents gave substantial support to the market for
colonial loans by using colonial stock to bolster the floating of new colonial issues.
This technique was vulnerable in two main respects: first, the withdrawal of colonial
stock by certain territories could render the practice inoperable. Second, any large-
scale support for a market which was increasingly out of favour with investors was
not considered to be sound policy during the liberalization of trade and payments
when Britain streamlined her financial and credit system. The Bank of England and
the Treasury considered this policy to be untenable in the long run. For these issues,

The End of the British Empire:
A Synthesis and an Interpretation
This book has sought to illuminate Britain’s ties with her empire as part of
changing sterling relationships between the mid-1940s and the end of
the 1950s. 1 The final chapter will present the study’s principal findings and
advance a new interpretation of the end of the British empire.
Between 1947 and 1958, Britain’s external relations hinged on sterling
relations, of which the empire was an important, though eventually fading,
component. During this period, the balance in Britain’s imperial connection
became reset. Critical junctures in this transformation can be identified;
from them a systematic pattern of the changing logic of imperial control
emerges. From this vantage point, one can assess the reasons why Britain
relinquished the empire at the end of the 1950s. In particular, it is possible
to relate British policy assessments of the advantages and disadvantages of
empire to changing sterling policy during the period.
1. Critical junctures
The first juncture of 1947–8 marked a rupture with liberalizing trends that
were becoming visible in 1945 and 1946. After the independence of India,
the remaining imperial sterling area became crucial in supporting Britain’s
external economic relations. The area was consciously managed to support
the British economy by boosting exports from the colonies to hard currency
areas and by restraining imports. Britain systematically promoted colonial
export commodities that earned or saved dollars while relying heavily on
discriminatory controls to reduce imports and hard currency expenditure.
In other words, export earnings were not spent to an equal amount on
imports into the colonies but accumulated as sterling balances in London.
Simultaneously, Britain boosted forms of colonial economic development
that suited these needs.
To an important extent, Britain’s reorientation in imperial policy after the
war was prompted by pressure from Washington to implement liberal mul­
tilateralism. Faced with an acute dollar shortage, the British economy was
191192 Money and the End of Empire
unable to support rapid liberalization. Consequently, Britain experienced
balance of payments crises which brought her to the brink of economic
collapse when the convertibility of sterling failed in 1947. Discriminatory
management via the empire was intended to support Britain’s nascent wel­
fare state by compensating for the insufficient level of credits from the
United States. It also played a role in containing inflation in Britain at a crit­
ical moment of postwar reconstruction.
For the majority of the Labour government, this economic symbiosis was,
moreover, part of a discriminatory design for an international economic
order. However, for other pillars of the British polity, notably the Treasury
and the Bank of England, the empire served as a temporary respite before
returning sterling to its classic international role. High commodity prices
during the period reinforced Britain’s reliance on the empire. Colonial mon­
etary arrangements, with their full currency cover and the limited role of
local monetary and financial institutions, supported the accumulation of
colonial balances beyond anticipated levels. For the Colonial Office, the
novel emphasis on colonial development reflected postwar idealism and,
for a while, gave the flavour of reform to colonial economic policy, making
it politically and socially palatable in the colonies. Thus, as shown in chap­
ters 4 and 5, Britain’s close association with the empire was an expedient
that was firmly embedded in her international economic policy during the
sterling crises of 1947–52.
The juncture of 1958 defined an important discontinuity between the
1950s and the 1960s, concluding the present investigation. Currency
convertibility marked the end of the discriminatory sterling area during
peace-time and an important step towards the liberalization of international
trade. This point irrevocably redefined Britain’s economic relationships with
her (former) empire. Crucial interest groups within the British polity had
long been lobbying for sterling internationalism. In 1958, moreover, chal­
lenges emerging from the European common market stirred British manu­
facturers into action. The contemporary strand of Toryism attempted to
court British industry with an active European policy while re-establishing
sterling cosmopolitanism as the pillar of external economic policy. For both
groups, the colonies now lacked relevance and external economic policy
became disconnected from the empire. Making capital exports and sterling
cosmopolitanism work implied reshaping the way in which Britain’s
external payments were settled and dispensing with protectionist arrange­
ments on the periphery and at home – balance of payments permitting.
Colonial sterling balances were a future liability or even an acute destabiliz­
ing factor. Policy-makers withstood new demands for capital flows to the
colonies since these hampered the transition to a more liberal sterling area.
Meanwhile, established mechanisms supporting colonial development
finance ceased to operate, and multilateralism eroded the orthodox func­
tioning of colonial monetary arrangements, though central banks were putThe End of the British Empire 193
in place (or planned) to ensure that monetary orthodoxy continued after
independence. In addition, convertibility enhanced the periphery’s hope of
achieving economic development. This peripheral development was differ­
ent from the one initiated by Britain in the late 1940s and was not con­
ducive to sustaining the sterling group under liberal conditions. At the same
time, moreover, commodity prices slumped and the dollar continued to
undermine sterling’s role as a reserve currency. As chapters 8 and 9 have
shown, a return to the old discriminatory imperial policies was neither tech­
nically nor politically feasible.
The 1960s differed considerably from the 1950s with respect to the inter­
national economy, Britain’s external economic relations, and the develop­
ment of states on the periphery. Britain’s return to cosmopolitanism had
been long in the making, and had been given renewed impetus by the
Bretton Woods Agreement and the influence of the Bank of England and the
Treasury. Discriminatory sterling arrangements had been only a temporary
means to economic recovery. Moreover, policy-makers had realized in the
late 1950s that the periphery’s role in Britain’s external economic relations
was bound to diminish: Britain’s trade and capital flows were turning away
from the empire and Commonwealth; Europe became a priority, and liberal
multilateralism provided alternative support to London as a financial centre.
On the periphery, expansionist economic policies challenged colonial
financial and monetary arrangements and restrictions on imports from the
dollar area. The coherence of the sterling area had long been strained
because Britain was unable to provide the empire with a sufficient level of
finance from the London money market. Therefore, the British expected the
periphery to use its accumulated resources in the medium term for develop­
ment, though some changes were slower in coming than British policy-
makers anticipated in the late 1950s.
None the less, the overall level of overseas sterling balances remained high
in the 1960s and sterling area membership did not flag. However, the geo­
graphical distribution of the balances moved away from the former empire.
Where balances remained high and monetary arrangements virtually
unchanged, this was due to internal developments in the new states. In
Malaya/Malaysia, the process of pursuing a monetary strategy independent
of the sterling area was slow largely because of domestic political debates
about the association with (or separation from) Singapore in currency
matters. Therefore, the central bank did not take up its issuing function; no
fiduciary issue was used until the mid-1960s. However, as trade flows
changed, Malaysia cautiously diversified into dollars, and eventually aban­
doned the currency board system in June 1967, shortly before the second
postwar devaluation of sterling. 2
On the other hand, in Ghana large balance of payments deficits emerged,
and Ghana’s sterling balances (including the marketing board funds) dissi­
pated in the early 1960s (mainly to finance the Volta dam). Provisions that194 Money and the End of Empire
allowed the holding of reserves in currencies other than sterling were put
in place. In Ghana and Nigeria too some diversification of reserves into the
dollar and gold took place, the fiduciary currency margins were consider­
ably increased, and Ghana and Nigeria defined the parity of their currencies
in gold. In the early 1960s, European countries had become reluctant to
hold dollars because of the dollar glut, and preferred to hold gold instead.
The periphery was also keen on gold, but for these countries the dollar
retained much of its appeal, given sterling’s continuing problems and the
legacy of their relationship with Britain.
Between 1947 and 1958 three other junctures, in 1949–50, 1953 and
1956–7, reoriented Britain’s imperial ties. In 1949–50, Britain’s economic
relations with the empire converged further as the combined result of
the devaluation of sterling and the Korean War a few months later. The 30
per cent devaluation was designed to remedy Britain’s continuing balance
of payments problems by improving the export prospects of British manu­
factures. With regard to the empire, devaluation was relevant because
it increased import prices, made sterling sources more important and
thus intensified the need to regulate imports and dollar expenditures.
The Korean War boom, which most notably affected Malayan rubber and
tin, considerably enhanced the dollar earning capacity of the colonies.
Supported by import controls, the colonial sterling balances soared to
unexpected heights. This cushioned the dollar shortage and eased sterling
balance of payments crises.
Meanwhile, however, some important colonial development schemes
failed. Moreover, discriminatory sterling management was nearing its
limits in terms of the feasibility of import restraint and the saturation of
export markets. By 1953, the discriminatory management of empire had
been severely damaged. To make things worse, Britain’s very success in
discriminatory management, in conjunction with the commodity boom,
promoted political discontent on the periphery. Facing continued austerity,
some political activists, especially in West Africa, now saw the pre-eminent
role of the colonies in dollar pooling as evidence of Britain’s failure to
deliver adequate development.
The year 1953 thus marked an important juncture in terms of imperial
economic policy. The Conservative government, in power since 1951, had
by that time firmly set its sights on sterling internationalism and a liberal
welfare state. This prompted the realization that the high level of colonial
sterling balances might pose serious problems for Britain’s volatile balance
of payments and reserves under a future design of liberal multilateralism.
Policy-makers considered how best to protect British resources. They
attempted to slow down and control the move towards economic self-
government in the empire. Consequently, the economic relationship
between Britain and the empire diverged. From this juncture, British policy
aimed at reducing the colonial sterling balances, while retaining the optionThe End of the British Empire 195
of discriminatory policies for times of crises, and also scaled down the
colonial development drive to very specific needs of the sterling area. The
new policy reduced the full colonial currency cover by a modest amount
and approved development loans from the London money market only
when balances had been used first. Doubts emerged as to whether liberal­
ization was ultimately reconcilable with the self-sustaining mechanism of
inter-colonial borrowing. The British were also wary of soaring demands
for development finance that ran counter to their modified external eco­
nomic objectives. Capital flows to areas rich in sterling were undesirable.
Given the move towards convertibility, they increased the risks for sterling,
even if they temporarily backed the balance of payments. Meanwhile, as
shown in chapters 6 and 7, moves towards multilateralism had an impact
on imperial relations when pressures from the periphery for changes in
monetary arrangements and the liberalization of imports gathered pace.
The winter of 1956–7 was a juncture for imperial relations since the Suez
crisis provoked a serious reserve crisis for sterling at a time when Britain’s
move towards convertibility was irreversible. In addition, policy-makers
feared that the independence of the important sterling area members, the
Gold Coast/Ghana and Malaya in early and mid-1957, might unleash new
claims on Britain’s resources. Suez redefined the priorities of Britain’s exter­
nal economic policy and made plain to policy-makers that she had to rely
on her own (limited) resources. The British stepped up numerous policy
reviews to reassess Britain’s external economic relations after Suez. With
regard to the colonies, these reviews revealed that the problems of the
considerable level of colonial sterling balances and the rising demands for
colonial development finance remained unresolved or had worsened. From
this point, British policy focused on streamlining the sterling area relation­
ship and fending off possible threats to convertibility. The British virtually
suspended colonial loans from the London market, dismantled protective
mechanisms for colonial finance, and targeted capital exports towards
growth areas outside the empire. The looming commodity slump shattered
any positive role for the colonies in the sterling area. Caught between the
inescapable convertibility operation, reserve problems and dismal options of
external aid, policy-makers became exercised by Malaya’s and Ghana’s eco­
nomic policies, given their still considerable sterling holdings. Suez dented
sterling’s reputation and also Britain’s confidence that the periphery’s alle­
giance to the sterling area was cast in stone. As discussed in chapters 8 and
9, the Suez crisis imposed considerable strains on Britain, and heightened
British awareness of the contradictions between Britain’s liberalization and
established imperial economic relationships. Interpretations that seek to
minimize the significance of the Suez crisis are not borne out by this study.
Across the period under review the above junctures mark out con­
tinuities and discontinuities in the essential areas of Britain’s imperial
economic policy: trade, finance, development and economic organization.196 Money and the End of Empire
In summary, Britain’s trade policy in the sterling empire moved from
modest liberalization in 1945–6 abruptly into discriminatory management
which lasted until about 1954–5. A gradual liberalization followed which,
however, became substantial only after 1958. Britain boosted colonial
development in commodity production and infrastructure, particularly
between 1947 and 1951, by which time the state’s initiative in promoting
development faded. The bulk of the colonial loans from the London mar­
ket and CD&W was allocated in the early 1950s. After 1953, a return to
self-financing was tied in with the withdrawal of the colonial sterling
balances. After 1958, Britain put greater emphasis on export credit arrange­
ments, abandoned support for the loans market and phased out CD&W
after the independence of colonies.
In terms of international economic organization, British policy forged an
imperial protectionist bloc between 1947 and 1953 as an alternative to a
closer association with the United States or Europe. From the early 1950s,
Britain moved deliberately towards convertibility and a liberalized sterling
area. This move, after 1957, necessitated the greater reliance on Britain’s
own resources and the recognition of the need to foster closer ties with
Europe. Policy on monetary and marketing arrangements, and from about
1953 Britain’s attitude towards peripheral demands for colonial central
banking, were largely judged against the need of securing the accumulation
of the sterling balances. Subsequently, policy focused on reducing the
balances by monitoring their use for development, and eventually merely
on delaying claims.
2. Sterling relations and imperial control
The discriminatory running of the sterling area during the critical period of
the 1947 convertibility crisis shows just how crucial political control in the
empire was for British policy. Direct control proved decisive with regard to
radical import restraint, the planning of imports and dollar expenditure,
and the allocation of development resources. Moreover, control over mar­
keting and currency arrangements was a vital stabilizing factor for such a
policy. Britain depended on policy alliances across the sterling area in
countries which could sell dollar-earning produce and expand commodity
production. Demand on the world market determined that Malayan
rubber, West African cocoa and Australian wool fetched high export prices
and could be sold in the dollar area. But, the pillars of the discriminatory
sterling area were ultimately determined by factors of political control,
even if Britain at that time still had some success in securing the allegiance
of the independent sterling group. In the West African empire and Malaya,
political obstacles to discriminatory policies were believed to be minimal,
and Britain was able to rely on the colonial state and its administration.
British policy in West Africa could still brush aside unofficial members ofThe End of the British Empire 197
legislative councils or marketing boards. 3 The Malayan Emergency made
colonial policy more difficult, but Britain’s good relations with the Malay
elite, together with boom conditions for rubber, guaranteed a relatively
smooth running of the territory’s economy. Urban elites, moreover,
welcomed the development drive.
None the less, discriminatory arrangements were not entirely unproblem­
atic. In the Gold Coast, restricting imports of textiles too rapidly was an
important contributory factor to local protests. 4 The more effective import
controls and dollar earning became, the stronger also the pressure from
export-oriented indigenous entrepreneurs, who felt that the domestic finan­
cial system did not accommodate their needs. Commercial cocoa producers
in the Gold Coast became increasingly aware of their dollar-earning capacity
as opposed to the fixed-price regime of the marketing boards. Malayan plan­
tation and smallholder production proved to be easier to manage. In
1947–8, colonial policy somewhat hastily responded to an economic
emergency. Subsequently, colonial economic policy became more refined as
officials realized where political control in the empire mattered most.
The 1949 devaluation increased the cost of imports from the dollar area
in terms of sterling. Greater import stringency was needed to retain the
export effects of the devaluation and to maximize the value of the Korean
commodity boom at the sterling area level. Policy needed even more
regulatory leverage than before 1949; political conditions either smoothed
or impeded such leverage. Favourable conditions soon faded in the inde­
pendent Commonwealth, Rhodesia and Kenya, but persisted in the Gold
Coast and Nigeria, as well as in Malaya in spite of the Emergency there. 5 In
the late 1940s, consumer goods imports were confined to a relatively small
urban population. Development finance was centrally regulated and
excluded local authorities and the indigenous private sector. The self-finan-
cing of development was feasible, as was the maintenance of orthodox
colonial monetary arrangements, which supported austerity. Moreover,
Britain was able to circumvent political pressures on the periphery by polit­
ical reform, as the case of the Gold Coast shows. 6 Colonial constitutional
advance became not only acceptable but was deemed necessary. British pol-
icy-makers were keen to use the political opportunities that the empire
offered for the management of the sterling area. 7 However, the success of
these policies owed as much to chance as to design. Moreover, in the late
1940s few policy-makers fully realized the precise role played by colonial
monetary and trade arrangements in maintaining the sterling balances
during a commodity boom. The commodity boom and the feasibility of
discriminatory policies in the empire proved a temporary blessing, which
soon turned into a liability, both literally and figuratively.
By 1953, the exorbitant level of the colonial sterling balances had diluted
Britain’s confidence in controlling political risks in the empire while moving
more decisively towards her long-term objective of sterling convertibility.198 Money and the End of Empire
Recent research on the sterling area has given insufficient emphasis to the
political volatility of the colonial sterling balances. 8 Colonies needed to be
enticed into using their accumulated balances. But withdrawals had to be
adjusted also to Britain’s precarious balance of payments. This necessitated
a firm grip by Britain on the various policies that affected the balances.
Some officials believed, wrongly, that a considerable part of the colonial
sterling balances resulted from British capital exports to the colonies. 9
Restraint on new development finance was, therefore, bound up with the
cautious use of balances for development. This was politically tricky: it
appeared to stifle the recently launched development drive by blocking
loans on the London market, while doing no more than keeping ajar the
possibility of development finance from the balances. Similarly, the mod­
est reduction of the currency cover, which facilitated withdrawals, risked
inviting demands for a large reduction in accordance with the practice of
the independent Commonwealth. 10 This situation had a vexed corollary:
territories which had not played a crucial role in discriminatory manage­
ment (and had few balances to draw upon, such as Kenya) were given pri­
ority in capital exports to prevent them from undermining colonial
monetary arrangements by demanding an extension of the fiduciary
issue. 11 Thus, it became more difficult to achieve the form of control
Britain required, particularly in the Gold Coast. But formal concessions in
currency matters allied to constitutional reform allowed Britain to retain
substantial control of currency and marketing arrangements. Britain’s
reliance on nationalist support had a similar effect. Britain marginalized
indigenous commercial entrepreneurs involved in commodity production
by favouring state-led smallholder production, and sought allies from
among political lobbyists isolated from economic interest groups. 12 With
regard to the sterling balances, policy measures were over-cautious to the
point of being ineffective, while continued import restrictions became the
target of increasing criticism, even from local colonial administrations.
In the aftermath of the Suez crisis of 1956, the British discovered that the
colonial sterling balances had remained at a very high level. 13 The lack of
alternative support for Britain’s balance of payments and reserves made
releases of balances problematic. Ideally, Britain required self-restraint on
the periphery to keep the sterling area going and to pre-empt moves
against sterling by the withdrawals of balances or the retention of dollar
earnings. The large holders of colonial sterling needed to be persuaded
to phase the withdrawal of balances and to adhere to orthodox colonial
monetary arrangements at a time when there was a virtual moratorium on
development loans. The independence of the Gold Coast and Malaya, both
in 1957, complicated this situation because it effectively impeded inter-colo-
nial borrowing. The liquidity of investment portfolios was a problem with
respect to Ghana, though not Malaya. Moreover, Britain needed to curtail
the disinvestment of colonial stock, notably by Malaya and Kenya, becauseThe End of the British Empire 199
it had an adverse effect on the market for colonial loans. Fortunately for
Britain, Malaya did not intend to move in this direction and Kenya could
be told not to do so. The situation was more critical with regard to Ghana.
However, policy-makers began to examine strategies of informal influence
as an alternative to direct control. As the banker of the sterling area, Britain
had some leverage in applying sanctions to ‘rogue behaviour’ in the ster­
ling area, or at least in making it plain that this entailed a penalty. 14 Due to
their technical expertise, the British were also still able to exert a degree of
informal influence on policy choices in newly-independent countries,
especially on central banking.
The official convertibility of sterling in 1958 greatly reduced the
effectiveness of direct political control. Direct control could still secure
colonial allegiance to the sterling area’s unwritten rules concerning the
sterling balances, reserves in sterling and trade policies. This ability still
had some importance in reinvigorating sterling internationalism in the
face of balance of payments problems. But, in principle, sterling interna­
tionalism implied control via the appeal of a sterling-based international
payments system to which Britain held the strings. 15 In order to function
properly, this system required a high degree of complementarity between
the British and peripheral economies. After convertibility this no longer
existed. Trade and capital exports shifted increasingly to the industrialized
world and to growth areas outside the empire and the newly independent
colonies, while commodity prices slumped. Consequently, Britain had few
incentives to provide compensatory capital exports to these areas; con­
versely, the periphery had little positive incentive to adhere to sterling area
rules, and was inclined to recast protectionist measures to suit its needs.
Britain’s needs had also changed; she now required influence mainly out­
side the empire and the newly independent colonies. In the (former)
empire, notably Ghana and Malaya, Britain tried to counter harmful moves
in economic policy rather than seeking to foster new forms of economic
cooperation. British policy towards development aid mirrors the new expe­
dience of economic as opposed to direct political control after 1958. Policy
moved away from direct bilateral aid and London market issues towards
export credits and multilateral arrangements. Britain’s continuing concerns
were also reflected in her attempts to direct central banking policy in
Nigeria, Ghana and Malaya via currency negotiations and legislation. 16
3. The rationale of Britain’s retreat
No facile link exists between patterns of economic change and control and
the end of colonial rule. Important changes in the international state
system often result from large-scale armed conflict. 17 However, the inde­
pendence of British colonies after 1945 did not occur in such a way. Nor
did Britain have a planned long-term policy approved by the government200 Money and the End of Empire
and Parliament for withdrawing from empire. Her sudden retreat during
and after 1960 contradicted the doctrine of emancipatory gradualism
(employed since the independence of the ‘old’ Commonwealth) to which
Africa had ‘graduated’ only after the war. 18 At this stage, the independence
of the colonies resulted from one major policy decision. The decision was
driven by the nature of the British polity and government and the close
link during the period between Britain’s international economic manage­
ment and imperial economic relationships. 19 Broadly speaking, the British
system of government emphasized consensus politics and bipartisanship.
Interdepartmental committees were crucial, especially when technical
matters figured prominently. Here, problems arose in imperial economic
policy which had the potential to overturn Britain’s basic attitudes
towards the empire. These problems could not be overcome merely by
moving towards self-government, as had been the case since the mid­
1940s, or by forging a new economic alliance with the colonies. However,
Macmillan did not advertise his decision once he had reached it because
Britain’s retreat from empire was bound to be most unpopular with the
backbenchers in the Conservative Party. Moreover, some well-known
Conservatives were still ardent imperialists and had not yet reinvented
themselves as ‘Little Englanders’, as was the case in the 1960s. Perhaps
most importantly, Macmillan did not have a popular mandate until the
general election of 1959.
By the mid-1950s, discriminatory sterling management with its emphasis
on the empire, had run its course. For technical reasons alone, trade flows
could not be redirected further towards hard currency markets and import
restrictions not be tightened further. Britain’s economic relationship with
the empire was becoming a victim of its own success. Holding on to existing
trade restrictions was hardly feasible in view of both Britain’s move towards
convertibility and increased future claims on the sterling balances. 20
Meanwhile, the development push on the periphery inevitably raised
financial requirements in areas that were not conducive to the needs of the
sterling area. Moreover, a liberal money market was unlikely to meet such
demands at the required level. 21 Traditionally, the empire served as a safe
haven for British investment and had been supported by protec­
tive arrangements, such as the trustee schemes. But the empire no longer
inspired the confidence of investors, while support for the market for
colonial loans had no place in Britain’s streamlined liberal financial system
at the end of the 1950s. At this point, and for the first time, Britain became
keen on attracting US investment in the colonies. In the discriminatory
sterling area, direct political control helped to implement the measures
that supported hard currency earnings and savings. In the reformed
sterling area, however, such direct control was less feasible; moreover, it
contradicted the very design of cosmopolitan sterling relations that was
emerging in the late 1950s.The End of the British Empire 201
The independence of the Gold Coast and Malaya was the result of
traditional British gradualism. 22 Policy-makers had hardly anticipated, even
by the mid-1950s, that formal independence might markedly impede the
role these territories would play in the sterling area. The contradiction that
this entailed became plain in 1957. The independence of the two territo­
ries, scheduled from about 1956, took place in a transformed context. The
Suez crisis refocused Britain’s attention on solving her balance of payments
problems on her own. The convertibility operation could not be delayed
much longer in case confidence in sterling was severely harmed.
Consequently, the Gold Coast’s attempt to profit from Britain’s weakness
by pressing for a rapid withdrawal of her balances shocked the British
officials. But there was no reneging on the commitment to independence
either. 23 To have done so would have sent an unmistakable signal about
the state of the pound to international investors and speculators. More­
over, extending colonial rule would not have dissipated lobbying on the
balances issue. Britain was fortunate that conditions in Malaya were more
accommodating. But the independence of the Gold Coast and Malaya also
marked the end of Britain’s emancipatory imperial deal. Thereafter, the
independence of the remaining British colonies was decided on a different
basis.
By the end of 1958, the convertibility of sterling had been introduced. 24
As a result, Britain, for better or worse, had to put up with changes in trade
and capital flows which shaped a transformed sterling area. Meanwhile, the
big investors in the City of London discovered in the Eurodollar market the
prospects of a profitable outlet as an alternative to sterling area investment.
In 1958, too, Britain’s balance of payments had made a recovery, albeit tem­
porary, and the dollar gap had closed. On the periphery, balance of pay­
ments deficits emerged, when the slump in commodity prices intersected
with economic expansionism induced by state-led development plans.
The latter inspired increased trade with the dollar world, and encouraged
the holding of dollar reserves. Meanwhile, pressure on the sterling balances
persisted. None the less, with regard to the important ex-colonies, the acute
crisis of 1957 had been allayed by 1960 because substantial balances had
been gradually withdrawn by Ghana, whose economy was by then in dire
straits. Moreover, the British felt secure with the continuing close allegiance
of Malaya. With regard to the monetary arrangements in the (former)
colonies, substantial modifications had been accepted and gradually phased
in by 1960. 25
The colonies occupied an increasingly awkward position in Britain’s
European policy. 26 By 1960 Britain had to find some accommodation with
Europe, even if this meant joining the EEC. Europe had grown into a crucial
market that Britain’s manufacturers and investors could not afford to ignore.
The reconciliation of sterling cosmopolitanism with policy towards the Euro­
pean Common Market proved vexatious. Britain’s key concern continued to202 Money and the End of Empire
lie with keeping agriculture and the Commonwealth out of European
arrangements in order to protect sterling area settlements. Given this situa­
tion, the British had little to offer the periphery as an incentive to support a
cosmopolitan sterling group. This contrasted with France’s close association
of its ex-colonies in the field of European agricultural policy as part of the
franc zone.
In addition, the problem of colonial development finance reached
an impasse at the end of the 1950s. 27 Major means of raising colonial
finance disappeared when the sterling balances diminished and Ghana’s
and Malaya’s investment funds could no longer be used for inter-colonial
investment. Moreover, the reform of trustee law (accepted by the Bank of
England since mid-1957) channelled institutional investment away from
the colonies. The London market was not prepared to give preference to
loans to the empire, especially Africa; the British government, in pursuit of
sterling cosmopolitanism, had little incentive to compromise her liberal
policy priorities.
These diverse factors show that Britain’s economic relationship with her
(former) empire lacked real potential after 1958. More importantly, problems
arose which suggested that Britain would benefit from abandoning colonial
rule. This can be seen clearly from the policy assessment of 1957 – one of
two main policy assessments on the subject. 28
Late in 1946, the Economic Section of the Treasury had weighed the pros
and cons of withdrawing from the empire. 29 Gains might result from
economies that Britain would make in scrapping colonial administrations
and also in reducing certain defence commitments. By contrast, ‘jobs for
the boys’ would inevitably be lost. The Section also stressed that Britain
needed to ensure the controlled withdrawal of colonial sterling balances
accumulated during the war. In 1946, however, the comparatively low level
of colonial sterling balances outside India meant that phased withdrawals
in most territories were relatively unproblematic. 30 This policy was in line
with Keynes’s advice: he had advocated accumulating balances during the
war, but warned of the consequences of such a strategy in peace-time. 31 But,
as the present study has amply demonstrated, British policy, in connection
with the 1947 crisis, took precisely the opposite course from what the
Economic Section had suggested a year earlier. 32
The assessment of mid-1957 contrasts with that of 1946 in its context
and relationship to contemporary policy initiatives. In January 1957, in the
aftermath of Suez, the newly installed Prime Minister Macmillan (formerly
the Chancellor of the Exchequer) asked the Colonial Policy Committee for
an assessment of constitutional development in the colonies and for some
cost-benefit account on ‘abandoning’ the empire. 33 This assessment argues
that Britain might gain some advantage in withdrawing from the empire
in two ways: by economizing on colonial loans including CD&W alloca­
tions, and by capitalizing on political reform in territories that had reachedThe End of the British Empire 203
a certain degree of internal constitutional development to strengthen ties
with the periphery. However, the appraisal was adamant that any transfer
of power must take place in an atmosphere that did not impede Britain’s
sterling policy. The colonial sterling balances were assumed to be under
control since only a limited part of them was disposable. But the currency
cover had to remain high, and existing trade relations must not suffer.
Provided these prerequisites were met, changes in colonial rule did not
matter from the perspective of Britain’s external economic policy. In
this sense, the 1957 assessment belongs to the ‘old’ tradition of British
gradualism.
None the less, it needs to be emphasized that the Treasury and the Bank of
England did not share the Colonial Office’s conservative definition of vul­
nerable funds. The statistical assessment also varied in different territories,
and limited liquidity was not necessarily a protection against claims on the
balances, as the case of Ghana showed. 34 Moreover, at this point there were
still doubts as to which territories would qualify for independence as
Commonwealth members and which were fit merely to achieve internal
self-government. 35 Even as late as May 1957, the government refused to
commit itself on the issue of Nigeria’s independence. 36 Officials were still
strangely confident (or out of touch) and continued to believe that local
majorities (with ‘proper guidance’) would subscribe to Britain’s policy
requirements.
Interpreted in the wider context, the 1957 ‘cost-benefit’ assessment on
empire implied that it might be advisable to abandon colonial rule. In the
course of 1957 and 1958, pressing financial problems piled up that raised
questions about the future of the empire. Throughout the period 1946–60,
the overall retreat from the empire never figured in Cabinet Conclusions,
while individual colonies hardly mattered for Britain’s key policy-makers.
Policy was mainly designed by crucial interdepartmental committees and
then approved and carried through in bits and pieces. In this respect, there
existed a close link between the actual initiative of withdrawing from the
empire and the financial theme discussed in this study. The 1957 assessment
of empire links up neatly with important debates and judgements in the
Economic Policy and Economic Steering Committees, as well as with
Cabinet decisions. The central issues concerned sterling policy and the
streamlining of the sterling area, Commonwealth development and finance,
as well as capital exports in general. 37
By 1957, these bodies had become aware of the imminent claims on
British resources in relation to liberalization and economic changes on the
periphery. It became clear that day-to-day policy-making ought to take into
account the fact that Britain had to carry this burden in order to maintain
the sterling area and sterling as a key currency of international exchange. 38
After Suez, colonies needed to exercise continued restraint in economic pol­
icy. This was realistic only if a certain level of development finance was204 Money and the End of Empire
forthcoming. 39 The British government, however, had other priorities,
namely areas of growth potential which received limited financial flows.
Therefore, it was argued, Britain ought to take a cautious view of bilateral
aid, discontinue CD&W as well as the operation of the CDC after a country’s
independence, and focus on flexible ad hoc arrangements. 40 The legacy of
the sterling area and Britain’s continued commitment to a strong pound also
prompted the government to seek to exclude overseas territories from a
European free trade area. 41
Meanwhile, Britain sought alternative holders of sterling balances, such
as Kuwait, 42 and alternative sources of capital for the colonies. Raising
loans collectively at the level of the Commonwealth, however, did not turn
out to be feasible. 43 A special body was established to supervise external
investment. 44 The British deemed it necessary to skirt the issue of indepen­
dent dollar and gold reserves at Commonwealth discussions and
even encouraged other Commonwealth countries to shoulder part of
colonial finances. 45 Problems with the functioning of (ex-)colonial
currency arrangements became more acute. The contradiction between cos­
mopolitanism on the one hand, and colonial economic arrangements and
aspirations on the other, then dawned on policy-makers. Recent develop­
ments encouraged this change of mind. These included the discussions
about the Ghanaian sterling balances and the liquidity of the Ghanaian
investment portfolio, pressures for non-sterling reserves, the virtual col­
lapse of the market for colonial securities and that of the inter-colonial bor­
rowing practices that had supported the market for colonial loans. 46 After
1958, the problem of providing capital to the periphery worsened. This sit­
uation is reflected in the Cabinet Conclusions on overseas investment and
Britain’s balance of payments. Consequently, Britain reoriented policy
towards international lending for development projects, and credits were
tied to British exports. 47 Investment options were also extended at home;
these further reduced capital flows to the colonies. 48 At the same time,
policy-makers also realized that claims from (ex-)colonial balances were
drawn out over a considerable period; so their burden on British resources
became manageable.
Thus the imperial connection had come full circle since 1946. The
underlying logic of the 1957 assessment suggested that abandoning
colonial rule was advisable either to achieve a gain, or to preserve strong
economic ties with the Commonwealth after independence. By the end of
the 1950s, the imperial link had also become largely irrelevant: a smooth
transition from empire appeared to be possible. However, no profitable
option for a new deal with the (former) empire was apparent, given
Britain’s transformed requirements in an environment of liberal multilater­
alism. We can now see the reasons for this discontinuity, which has puz­
zled historians for some time. 49 By early 1959, Britain’s pragmatic policy
towards the empire as part of her external economic relations had shiftedThe End of the British Empire 205
into a conscious assessment of the merits of imperial retreat, for which a
clear-cut policy gradually emerged. From this point onwards, British policy
sought a way to order the crucial problems that remained. The precise tim­
ing became a matter of the expedience of diplomatic and public relations.
At the end of 1958, the Prime Minister himself took over the chairmanship
of the Colonial Policy Committee. 50 Britain pursued a calculated policy
aimed at delaying changes in currency arrangements in the remaining
colonies. This policy focused on Nigeria, which stood between the old
gradualism and the new planned move to decolonize. 51 By 1960, an unoffi­
cial timetable had emerged with respect to independence dates, including
of course Nigeria. The timetable was greatly helped by the fact that nation­
alists were enthusiastic about political independence, and sometimes even
astonished to get it now so quickly. From 1960, negotiations became a mat­
ter of technicalities and of constitutional discussions led by the Colonial
Policy Committee with the aim of guaranteeing a smooth transfer of
power. This move affected all except very small colonies and included the
colonies of settlement, Kenya and Southern Rhodesia. 52
Power was transferred not only after the remaining empire as a whole
had become largely irrelevant to Britain’s external economic relations, but
when serious problems had emerged in the economic management of the
empire.
4. Explanations revisited
The above reinterpretation of the end of the British empire revises existing
academic and popular explanations of the subject. 53 The essential differ­
ences can be pinpointed by contrasting the characteristics of the tradi­
tional view with the interpretation advanced here. First of all, however, the
geographical limitations of the present re-evaluation need to be made
explicit.
The relatively small strategic outposts, such as Cyprus and Aden, clearly
elude an explanation of Britain’s retreat from the empire that is based
prominently on economic relationships. However, it is worth emphasizing
that empire ended when the technological changes of the missile age
prompted shifts in military strategy and geopolitical control, and when
Britain moved towards a closer strategic alliance with the United States,
partly necessitated by cuts in military expenditure. 54 The Sudan requires a
separate explanation because it was closely bound up with Anglo-Egyptian
relations. The important entrepôt, Hong Kong, too, held a special eco­
nomic status in the empire, and colonial rule there followed a peculiar
rationale. Other major territories, namely the West Indies, Rhodesia and
Kenya, stood on the margins of the imperial sterling area for most of the
period. They were of little consequence to the main thrust of Britain’s rela­
tions with the empire, even if they played a more prominent role in206 Money and the End of Empire
Britain’s foreign diplomacy. The settler colonies held a privileged position
in the sterling area, and it was not necessary to hasten political reform
towards independence. By contrast, in the Gold Coast, Malaya and Nigeria,
political reform was entwined with the continued viability of these territo­
ries for the sterling area. After 1959–60, however, changes in the imperial
relationship affected the economic management of all the (former)
colonies (except the strategic outposts), irrespective of their importance for
the sterling area.
If one now sets the interpretation of this chapter against the basic expla­
nations available in the literature for the end of the British empire, one
gets the following picture. ‘Planned’ decolonization in an ordered quasi-
legal sense did not take place. The piecemeal transfer of power became a
systematic policy only from the beginning of 1960, 55 and ought not to be
confused with moves towards local self-government or the granting of
independence to individual territories earlier. 56 Britain’s Colonial
Secretaries Lyttleton and Lennox Boyd had drawn a clear distinction
between internal self-government and independence: the former was
thought to be inevitable, the latter had to be retarded in West Africa and
avoided in East Africa. 57 Constitutional reform monitored by the Colonial
Office, however, was part of Britain’s running of the major colonies.
Within this context sterling relationships were subject to supervision,
though the effects of this engineering owed much to mere coincidence.
Beyond this implicit gradualism, constitutional reform did not constitute a
phasing out of colonial rule.
The impact of colonial nationalism, often understood as a force that ulti­
mately ousted the British from the empire, needs to be qualified, too. 58
Nationalism only really altered the main thrust of British policy when and
where it obstructed vital imperial sterling relationships and the colonial
institutions related to their management. British attitudes towards different
groups of nationalists in the Gold Coast are instructive in this connection.
In the Gold Coast and Malaya, Britain’s concessions to nationalist demands
assisted sterling area management. In other territories, and by 1960 in gen­
eral, nationalist activism had little impact on Britain’s external economic
relations, though it remains relevant to the bargaining that accompanied
the final moves to independence. Moreover, Britain’s retreat from the
empire in 1960 was unexpected. The vanguard of nationalist activists and
colonial administrators assumed that independence would occur on a long
time scale that differed in each colony. Some colonial officials thought that
Britain’s withdrawal was both hasty and a let-down for the colonies. 59
Ironically, changes in British policy largely unrelated to peripheral pres­
sures conferred ‘success’ on colonial nationalism in many colonies.
Consequently, the former colonial power was ready to join local activists in
saluting the ultimate triumph of self-determination. However, with the
emergence of new commercial elites, the socio-economic constellationThe End of the British Empire 207
in many colonies was in the long run in conflict with the way Britain had
traditionally ordered her relations with the imperial sterling area. 60 In this
sense, social and economic change and their political manifestations came
into conflict with Britain’s imperial design.
Similarly, peripheral crises were not per se also crises of the imperial
relationship, as is sometimes assumed. 61 The Malayan and Mau Mau emer­
gencies (officially from 1948–60 and 1952–60 respectively) certainly
counted among the critical episodes of colonial rule in individual territo­
ries. But, the Communist insurgency in Malaya did not substantially ham­
per rubber production and dollar earning, and British policy-makers were
not unduly concerned that it would. British worries about defence costs
were dwarfed in comparison with Malaya’s pivotal role for the sterling
area. 62 Mau Mau was a Kikuyu civil war related to economic change result­
ing from colonial land policies. Ultimately, Kikuyu commercial entrepre­
neurs obtained control over the colonial state. This was not what the
British originally had wished, and it fundamentally transformed the nature
of the alliance between Britain and Kenya. None the less, Kenya had been
rather marginal for Britain’s sterling relationships. In contrast, the Accra
riots in the Gold Coast of 1947 occurred in a crucial part of the imperial
sterling area in the aftermath of the convertibility crisis. But, rather than
frightening the British out of the empire, the riots signalled the discovery
of political reform as a means of securing the territory’s cooperation with
policies for protecting sterling; and even Nkrumah’s nationalism proved to
be accommodating, albeit only temporarily. 63
At the opposite extreme stands the view that Britain’s ‘decline’ as a great
power led to the ‘abandonment’ of the empire because she was too ‘weak’
in political or economic terms or because the empire was too ‘costly’. 64 Such
an explanation wrongly assumes that empires are retained by buoyant
economies and shed by frail ones, that the British empire was a liability, or
that the viability of the periphery was a necessary consequence of colonial
rule. However, developments during the period amply demonstrate Britain’s
reliance on the imperial sterling area during postwar economic recovery.
This worked well for a time. Eventually, economic liberalization and
Britain’s attempts to re-establish cosmopolitanism prompted the redeploy­
ment and restructuring of internal and external economic relations.
Economic weakness, defined, for example, by comparative economic perfor­
mance, or costs, is, therefore, an insufficient measuring device for the end
of empires.
Anti-colonial lobbying in international bodies, too, was of little
consequence for the end of colonial rule and is traditionally overvalued. 65
The emergence of the notion of self-determination in international rela­
tions ought not to be confused with the move towards the abandonment
of colonial rule or the independence of individual colonial territories. In
any case, Western domination of the United Nations held such pressures at208 Money and the End of Empire
bay. India and Ceylon did not attack the crucial economic issues in
Commonwealth economic conferences; these were different for them and
for the remaining empire. After the Bandung Conference in 1955, non­
aligned anti-colonial rhetoric in the United Nations, particularly from
Indian delegates, prompted demands by the Colonial Office to give British
colonial rule a positive image. 66 But the crucial British government depart­
ments took this in their stride, either because the criticism was too general
to be acted on or later because the empire’s role was fading. However,
Macmillan’s celebrated ‘wind of change’ speech at the beginning of 1960,
though it was delivered prior to the anti-colonialism resolution passed by
the General Assembly of the United Nations in December, 67 seems to have
owed something to Britain’s desire to recapture the moral high ground in
line with the new Kennedy administration in the United States. With this
scoop Macmillan salvaged an embarrassing episode in British overseas rela­
tions.
Likewise, within Britain, anti-colonial pressure groups were rather weak
and anyway had little influence upon policy-making. 68 The relevance of
technical details heightened the role of civil servants as opposed to
politicians and interest groups. Moreover, imperial policy was part of
Britain’s wider sterling policy, and this created problems that could not
simply be cast aside. 69 Lobbying was, therefore, almost irrelevant. Fabian
opinion had some influence on shaping political reform in the colonies
and particularly on approaches to colonial policy, but not on the retreat
from empire. 70 Similarly, as the empire became less important for Britain’s
external relations, pro-empire lobbyists were generally ignored by develop­
ment policy-makers. However, Britain did make sporadic concessions to
lobbyists, namely in respect to Hong Kong and Kenya, and settler lobbyists
played a role in the transfer of power negotiations. 71 On the whole, propo­
nents of sterling internationalism and advocates of closer ties with Europe
were much more influential than defenders of a protectionist empire. It is
therefore not so puzzling after all that a Conservative government phased
in the retreat from colonial rule.
Two remaining arguments need to be mentioned: the role of the
Anglo-American relationship, and the knock-on effect of the independence
of individual colonies and empires. The view that the United States, despite
its anti-colonial rhetoric, played only a negligible part in Britain’s retreat
from the empire is consistent with the present interpretation. 72 In the late
1940s and early 1950s, the support the empire gave to Britain’s economy
was conducive to US foreign policy needs and also accommodating to a
reluctant creditor. However, the evolution of sterling–dollar relations
affected the importance of the empire for Britain, especially after 1957–8.
Economic liberalization deflected peripheral policies towards trade with the
dollar area and, albeit less rapidly, towards dollar reserves. Moreover, once
the path to decolonization was open and the step taken in 1960, BritainThe End of the British Empire 209
and the United States may well have joined forces in their public relations
offensive aimed at the periphery. Competitive coexistence during the ‘Cold
War’ made it necessary to counter USSR propaganda by ‘freeing’ subject
peoples.
Cross-territorial ‘domino’ effects are of relatively little importance in
Britain’s retreat because, according to British gradualism, the independence
of colonies was decided on the merits of each case. In that respect, India was
different from the Gold Coast and Malaya, and the latter were different from
the remaining parts of the empire. 73 None the less, from 1960, British policy-
makers held the view that similar constitutional reforms needed to be imple­
mented in territories with comparable levels of economic development,
whether these were settler territories or not. Therefore, for example,
Rhodesia had to catch up with Ghana.
Cross-imperial influences are also by no means obvious as the case of
Portugal indicates, whose colonies did not become independent until the
mid-1970s. But, when the European Common Market devised means of
associating overseas territories, the Colonial Office envied the French for
having found a way of retaining the allegiance of parts of the former
empire. 74 For Britain, problems piled up in colonial economic management
and the sterling legacy meant that she had nothing similar that she could
offer the periphery. When France embarked on a clean sweep of empire,
Macmillan might well have found it was time for a face-saving mission, if
only in public relations terms, in his oft-quoted Africa tour.
*
To conclude: this study has identified and emphasized a hitherto often
neglected cause of Britain’s continuing involvement with empire after
the Second World War, namely the crucial financial relationship based on
sterling. It has been shown how this link first strengthened imperial ties and
then led to their abandonment. This occurred at an important juncture of
international economic relations. Future research into the immense docu­
mentation now available for this period may refine or even qualify the inter­
pretation of imperial relations advanced here. However, if this study has
merit, it is hoped that it will have helped to ensure that economic, and
specifically financial, relationships are placed at the centre of studies of the
international relations of the end of empire and of Britain’s imperial ties
generally.Notes

(see Conan, The Sterling Area, ch. 5). Moreover, whenever serious problems of
allegiance emerged, Britain resorted to bilateral negotiations and agreements,
notably in the 1940s in relation to checking the withdrawal of sterling balances
by independent members of the area.
The policy process of the Foreign Office has received due attention in its own
right. See, for example, Wallace, The Foreign Policy Process; Adamthwaite, ‘Britain
and the World’; Steiner, ‘Le système décisionnel’. The Permanent Secretary of
the Board of Trade (in the mid-1950s) confirmed the predominance of the
Chancellor and Treasury in British domestic and foreign economic policy:
Woods, ‘Treasury Control’, pp. 380–1.

period, see notably: Newton and Porter, Modernization Frustrated, ch. 5;

Currency boards were established in the following regional categories: West
African, East African, Southern Rhodesian, Malayan and West Indian. For early
developments, see Hopkins, ‘The Creation of a Colonial Monetary System’; for

also Newlyn and Rowan, Money and Banking, ch. 2; Shannon, ‘Evolution’,
pp. 347–9; Greaves, ‘Colonial Trade’, p. 55; Hogendorn and Gemery, ‘Con­

ignored for the present purpose.

was exclusively grown on small indigenous farms. In Malaya, rubber plantations
dominated, even though smallholder production was on the increase and by the
1930s had reached 40 per cent: Booth, ‘The Economic Development’, p. 28.

these issues under the term ‘primary resistance movements’: for example,

protest connected to changing socio-economic relations. See Crummey (ed.),

8. Contemporary studies usually distinguished only between the sterling area,
which included Britain, and the rest of the sterling area (RSA), which excluded
Britain. Such a distinction, however, conceals analytical aspects that are impor­
tant for the present purpose. The book will distinguish between Britain, the
overseas sterling area (or simply the sterling area) and, furthermore, between the
dependent and independent sterling area. It will be clear from the context when
the sterling area including Britain is addressed. The sterling area contained the
so-called scheduled territories, that is, the empire, the independent Common­
wealth (except Canada), and a number of other states: Iceland, Ireland, Burma,
Iraq, Jordan and Libya. The group’s composition slightly changed over the
period. Egypt was excluded in 1947. The dollar area contained the United States,
Canada and Latin America. Western Europe comprised what became in 1948 the
group of European OEEC countries.

25. A comparison of the values of Britain’s exports to the sterling area with those
towards Europe and North America combined shows a change in their ratio from
1.5:1 in 1947, to 1.1:1 in 1958, and an inversion of 0.9:1 in 1959. In other words,
while in 1947 the sterling area still received 49 per cent of Britain’s exports com­
pared to only 32 per cent of North America and Western Europe combined, by
1958 the percentages had changed to 44 per cent and 41 per cent respectively,
and by 1959 to 40 per cent and 45 per cent respectively. Key Statistics, BOTJ.

30. Contemporary studies of the sterling area always include general accounts and
statistics on the sterling balances (tables can be found in Bell, The Sterling Area,
pp. 22–3; Shannon, ‘The Sterling Balances’). These are summaries of command
papers (Cmd. 8065, Cmnd. 122, Cmnd. 977). However, published sources often
use geographical aggregates that changed over the period and are, therefore, dif­
ficult to compare. A monthly breakdown of regional aggregates of sterling bal­
ances is given in the Monthly Reports on External Finance prepared by the Bank of
England and the Treasury. Historical studies of the period now include to vary­
ing degrees these figures. However, territorial figures on the colonies are difficult
to obtain even from official documents and have not been published. For such
figures, see section 3.

37. Overall trade figures for geographical aggregates can be obtained from Colonial
Office Annual Reports The Colonial Territories (Cmd. 8243, Cmd. 8553, Cmd.
8856, Cmd. 9169, Cmd. 9489, Cmnd. 780) and for the 1950s from the Digest of
Colonial Statistics, and the BOTJ. However, detailed territorial figures are difficult
to obtain, as are accurate comparisons at the end of the 1950s, since territorial
aggregates in the Digest changed. In the following, trade figures will be assessed
from archival trade and balance of payments figures and compared with official
publications. However, it is not always clear whether or not invisibles have been
accounted for.
38. This colonial total, therefore, excludes the entrepôt centres Hong Kong and Aden
(though for technical reasons not Singapore), as well as Malta and Cyprus, and
thus comprises East Africa (including Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Somaliland,
but excluding Aden and possibly Zanzibar), West Africa (notably the Gold
Coast/Ghana and Nigeria, but also the Gambia and Sierra Leone), Malaya (usu­
ally including Singapore, because this territory held a common currency fund
with Malaya, Sarawak, and Borneo) and the West Indies.
39. Assessed from figures in the BOTJ and the Digest of Colonial Statistics. See also
data in PRO T 236/3562, 3850, 3851, and 3845. Calculations based on these
Treasury data give very similar results for the early 1950s. The surplus for West
Africa is higher, however.

ature. Relevant contemporary studies include Wright, ‘Dollar Pooling’. However,
due to British policy designs during the period, the archival sources concerned
with the colonial balance of payments with the dollar area are massive.
47. For the entire five-year period, the respective shares of the overall surplus were
;162 per cent, 918 per cent,;18 per cent, and962 per cent. See Treasury, ‘The

annual figures on the colonial sterling balances and geographical aggregates are
included in many contemporary publications on the sterling area. Monthly
aggregates are available from the Monthly Report[s] on External Finance. These will
be used for the general assessment that follows. Figures on territorial holdings
and detailed distributions among different funds were subject to a number of
exercises of government departments but were a bank secret. These references

Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland alone received a total of £39.4 million.
($110.3 million) in loans. Between 1948 and 1955 the colonies received a total
of £19.6 milion ($54.8 million) in loans and £6.1 million ($17 million) in
grants. About 44 per cent of the loans went to the East African High
Commission, 38 per cent flowed into the West Indies, about 17 per cent to East
Africa, but only 1.3 per cent to West Africa. Private direct foreign investment
during the four years 1950–53 was estimated for all colonies together at about
10 million (almost £5 million to the West Indies, and less than £4 million to
West Africa). It is unlikely that this was higher in the late 1940s, because the
British and colonial governments were highly selective in granting permission
for non-sterling investors.
Compare the balance of payments statistics in ‘Cabinet. Economic Steering
Committee. The Economic Significance of the Colonial Sterling Assets. Note by

No published overall assessments of these issues are available. However, some
territorial studies include relevant statistics (for example, Kay, The Political
Economy). Havinden and Meredith, Colonialism and Development, offer relevant
statistical summaries, notably on the terms of trade. But their geographical break­
down in many cases does not allow comparisons with the available absolute
trade figures.
Economic Co-operation Administration, The Sterling Area, p. 79.
Cocoa exports from the sterling area were basically equal to exports from the
Gold Coast and Nigeria. The share of cocoa of the total quantity of sterling area
cocoa exports that went to the dollar area stood at 44 per cent in 1950, and then
slowly fell to 41 per cent in 1951, 36 per cent in 1953 and then markedly to
about 20 per cent in 1954 and 1955. The share of rubber was 37 per cent in 1950,
32 per cent in 1951, 27 per cent in 1952, 24 per cent in 1953 and less than 20 per
cent thereafter. See BOTJ.

No recent studies are available that deal with these issues and their interrelation
in a rigorous manner. However, some of the archival figures used for the present
analysis are also mentioned in Morgan, Official History, vol. 3, chs. 4–5. Moreover,
there were contemporary debates on the purpose and desirable level of colonial
sterling balances. See notably Greaves, The Colonial Sterling Balances; Hazlewood,
‘Sterling Balances’; idem, ‘Memorandum of the Sterling Assets’; Nicolescu,
‘Sterling Balances’; King, ‘Sterling Balances’; Earle ‘Colonial Monetary Theory’;
‘Analyst’, ‘Currency and Banking in Jamaica’; Balogh, ‘Eyeless in Ghana’.
This was mainly a political issue, for which see chs. 4, 6 and 8. Only the techni­
cal and quantitative relations will be addressed in this chapter.
The assessment in this paragraph is based on detailed figures for the years 1949–54
in PRO T 220/427. Sinking and pension funds made up a small share of all govern­
ment funds and decreased from 18 per cent in 1949 to about 7 per cent in 1954.

Based on figures in PRO T 220/427. The picture for East Africa is similar, only
that here the share of government holdings had been higher already in 1949 (47
per cent) and increased to 57 per cent in 1954, whereas the share of currency
funds had been lower in 1949 (23 per cent) and increased to 29 per cent by
1954. The striking characteristic of West Indian holdings was that banking funds
were high and at the level of government holdings; both together made up
about 80 per cent of the total balances.
See Crown Agents, The Financial Work of the Crown Agents.
The assessment of liquidity is based on figures in ‘Working Party on Colonial
Sterling Balances, 1953, C.S.B.(53)2’, PRO T 233/933.
See Report of the Working Party on Colonial Sterling Balances, Sep 1953, PRO
CAB 134/887; and Report of the Working Party on Colonial Stock Issues, Aug
1958, PRO CO 1025/112.
The official definition changed slightly between the late 1940s and the late
1950s, due to the reduction of the full currency cover by 20 per cent. Moreover,
in the mid-1950s the Colonial Office thought that part of the marketing board
holdings could be withdrawn.
The absolute figures are £80 million, £130 million, £65 million, and £140 mil­
lion, respectively. The ‘excess’ balances of all colonies together were estimated as
amounting to £470 million. See Barker (B/E) to Loynes (B/E), ‘Colonial Sterling
Balances’, 9 Dec 1957, B/E ADM 14/50/808/2. A Treasury exercise of 1949 speci­
fied those balances that could under no circumstances be withdrawn, that is, the
special government funds. In the years 1947 and 1949, they made up about one
quarter each for West Africa, Malaya and the West Indies, and about 40 per cent222 Notes

cent, 400 per cent and 1,200 per cent respectively. See ‘Top Secret Treasury

p. 285; Rogow, The Labour Government, p. 46; Ingham, ‘Shaping Opinion’.
11. Treasury memoranda by R.W.B. Clarke are evidence of this. Bilateralists existed
among officials, but were sharply criticized: see Clarke (T) to Eady (T), ‘The Bank
Memorandum’, 26 Mar 1947, PRO T 236/2683. The Economic Section, however,
probably remained of little influence during the early years of the Labour govern­
ment. For a contemporary academic advocate of a rapid return to convertibility,
see Harrod, ‘The Problem’; idem, Are These Hardships Necessary? Other contempo­
rary economic observers urged for caution, especially because of the sterling
balances: Political and Economic Planning, ‘The Sterling Area II’, pp. 70–80.

employment. Dollar area imports should be reduced by at least £100 million at
1947 prices. To achieve this, an import diversion committee was set up:

Exceptions could be made for Malayan reconstruction. They were made for
Trinidad (because anticipated local loans did not materialize and there was a
danger of economic collapse). The East African High Commission was allowed to
raise a loan for transport development in 1949, which was essential for eco­
nomic development in the region. Colonial Secretary (CO) to colonies, ‘Loan

The Colonial Secretary originally had asked for about £40 million of colonial
borrowing for the next 3 to 4 years. Opinion inside the Treasury held that bor­
rowing had to be directly linked to a possible change in the currency cover if it
occurred. Pitblado (T) to Rowe-Dutton (T), 14 Sep 1948, PRO T 236/636.
Colonial Secretary (CO) to colonies, ‘Loan Policy’, 18 Jan 1949, PRO T 236/636.
A CO memo lists the colonial loan requirements for the period 1952–55, and
sets them against local development contribution. The overall loan requirement
is given as £140 million against £215 million of local contribution. For the
Malayan Area a requirement of £25 million against £55 million was listed, and
for the Gold Coast one of £20 million against £30 million. The Treasury recom­
mended a level of £80 million for the period, and thought that perhaps a further
£50 million could be obtained from IBRD lending. Brittain (T), ‘Colonial

This monitoring was done in the committees that dealt with the colonial bal­
ance of payments, namely the Colonial Dollar Drain Committee in the late
1940s and the Programmes Committee from 1952, and stood under the auspices
of the Economic Policy Committee.
Milward, ‘Motives for Currency Convertibility’, p. 264, argues that Britain aimed
to achieve a ‘rewriting’ of Bretton Woods in 1952–3 during the negotiations
with the United States on the so-called collective approach.
The issue of the sterling balances in Anglo-American diplomacy is given due
emphasis in Pressnell, External Economic Policy. See for these issues also ch. 4.

17. Studies have addressed many of these issues, though usually without an explicit
argument about the wider rationale of British policy and without access to
archival documents: see Bangura, Britain and Commonwealth Africa, ch. 2. An
excellent early case study is Rudner, ‘British Financial Policy in Post-War
Malaya’.

22. Studies of the colonies during the late 1940s rarely draw a link to British imperial
policy. For accounts of these protests in their own right, see, for example, Austin,
Politics in Ghana, ch. 2; Apter, Ghana, ch. 8; Iliffe, Modern History of Tanganyika,
pp. 402–4. On the other hand, many studies of the colonies during the Second
World War incorporate references to Britain’s economic wartime requirements:
see studies in Killingray and Rathbone, Africa and the Second World War.

sed the relationship between British business and Colonial Office policy. The
standard contemporary study is Bauer, ‘Origins of the Statutory Export
Monopolies’. See also Garlick, African Traders, p. 14. But compare for the war
period Meredith, ‘State Controlled Marketing’. The active involvement of the
colonial state from 1947 has received less than due attention. A case study cov­
ering the war is the unpublished Ph.D. thesis by Jan-Georg Deutsch, Educating

World War, the West African colonies had been instructed to import textiles
from the United States: ‘Colonial Dollar Drain Committee. Minutes. 3 Feb 1948.

6 Britain and Economic Liberalization: Imperial
Relations Adjusted, 1953–56
1. Contemporary and recent studies of Britain’s external economic relations are
valuable sources for studying the process of liberalization. See notably Strange,
Sterling; Cairncross, The British Economy, ch. 3; Milward, ‘Motives for Currency
Convertibility’; Pollard, The Development; Dow, The Management, pp. 70–103;
Harrod, The Pound Sterling; Polk, Sterling; and Brittan, The Treasury; see also
Schenk, Britain and the Sterling Area; idem, ‘The Sterling Area’. Some relevant
points from the viewpoint of imperial relations are made by Holland, ‘The
Imperial Factor’. More recently, Louis and Robinson, ‘The Imperialism of
Decolonization’, have taken a very broad view of Britain’s overseas policy
against the background of her sterling relations in the 1950s.
2. These issues are dealt with at length elsewhere. See, for example, Dow, The
Management, chs. 3 and 9; Shonfield, British Economic Policy; Cairncross, The
British Economy, ch. 3; Brittan, Steering; idem, The Treasury; Hutchison, Economics
and Economic Policy. For a review of contemporary academic opinion, see
Kindleberger, ‘The Position’.
3. For a near-contemporary assessment of the move towards convertibility, see
Harrod, The Pound; Kenen, British Monetary Policy, pp. 92–7; for a recent study,
see Milward, ‘Motives’.
4. See, for example, Thompson-McCausland (B/E) to Governor (B/E), ‘Monetary
Consequences of Free Imports’, 5 Oct 1953, B/E OV 44/61; also Thompson-
McCausland (B/E) to Governor (B/E), ‘Collective Approach Committee [Gilbert
Committee]’, 21 Jun 1954, B/E ADM 14/39; Bolton (B/E) to Deputy Governor
(B/E), ‘The Collective Approach Committee’, 5 Sep 1955, B/E OV 44/65. For fig­
ures on the balances, see Appendix to ch. 6.
5. This is borne out by the changed role attributed to the Colonial Development
Corporation. Little emphasis was now put on production schemes and more on
financing schemes. See Cowan, ‘Early Years’, p. 69. See also ‘Circular 184/53,
Confidential Dispatch, Development Policy’, 21 Feb 1953, PRO CO 852/1365.

The Central Office of Information edited a propaganda leaflet on British aid to
the colonies and the Commonwealth. This propaganda statement was destined
for Commonwealth and Colonial territories. It gave a bright picture of the
record of British aid, in sharp contrast to the assessment in the same file that the
colonies had so far largely financed development on their own. Central Office of
Information (London), ‘Britain’s Contribution to Economic Development
Overseas’, Jun 1956, PRO CO 1025/113.

Bank it was, moreover, doubted that ‘non-resident’ convertibility was feasible,
while restricting ‘resident’ convertibility. This would mean too much of a strain
on ‘oriental loyalty’. Fisher (B/E) to Governors (B/E), ‘The Sterling Area and

had been raised within the Bank by Fisher, the Bank’s main adviser on colonial
affairs and its representative on colonial currency boards. He took the case to the
Governor. Originally (when the Colonial Office raised the issue at the beginning
of 1952), the Bank had been against such discussions because this would have
revealed the growing borrowing problems. See Fisher (B/E) to Governor (B/E), ‘The
Colonies. Sterling Funds’, 26 Jan 1953, B/E OV 44/83/1536/2. The matter was first
discussed between the Bank and the Treasury without implicating the Colonial

make its imprint on the Collective Approach Committee. However, on the eve
of the 1954–5 sterling crisis, it was acknowledged that circles outside the City,
notably in industry, were by no means keen on convertibility. See: Bank of
England, ‘Note for Record’, 21 Feb 1955, B/E OV 44/64/1530/1, which refers to
such a statement by Hall, the Director of the Treasury’s Economic Section.

7 The Colonies, Politics and Economic Development:
Britain’s Liberalization Challenged, 1953–6
1. For some suggestion of connections between colonial development and Britain’s
external economic policy, see Fieldhouse, Black Africa, ch. 1; for a summary
of documents, see Morgan, The Official History, vol. 3, chs. 4 and 5. The study
by Havinden and Meredith, Colonialism and Development, offers great detail
on development statistics but makes few explicit connections to British policy.244 Notes

Prominent among these academics was W.A. (later Sir Arthur) Lewis. He was a
member of a delegation of academics that evaluated economic policies in devel­
oping countries for ECOSOC and strongly criticized the IBRD for its lack of
development initiatives (see, Mason and Asher, The World Bank, pp. 384, 462).

70. These areas now figured in the policy debate for other reasons, more remotely
connected with Britain’s external economic policy. For example, the West Indies
became linked to internal economic development in Britain as a source of cheap
labour, as an alternative to boosting industrial development in the West Indies.
In Kenya, the Mau Mau Emergency prompted concerns on how political stabil­
ity could be re-established by keeping the delicate equilibrium between African
and settler demands in the economic stakes of the colony.

views (Friedman, Essays, was published in 1953) and how both differed from
British conceptions of colonial monetary management are well worth investigat­
ing. Compare also the argument on a similar system (Panama) by a leading

archival sources. The views expressed in the Treasury, Bank of England, and
Colonial Office documents maintain that the director of the Bank of the Gold
Coast (Eggleston) was not sufficiently responsible and not knowledgeable
enough to be trusted in matters of central banking. See Colonial Office, ‘Brief for
the Secretary of State, Meeting With Mr. Gbedemah, Minister of Finance,
Gold Coast’, Sep 1955, PRO CO 1025/42; Fisher (B/E) to Governors (B/E), ‘West

1. Some general evidence of the repercussions of multilateralism is provided by
Miller, Survey, ch. 12; see also: Yeager, International Monetary Relations,
pp. 388–93; Hutchison, Economics and Economic Policy, pp. 161–77; Dow, The
Management. The wider context of British economic performance is well covered:
see Newton and Porter, Modernization Frustrated; Ingham, Capitalism Divided.
Contemporary studies include Harrod, The Pound Sterling; Shonfield, British
Economic Policy, ch. 6; Sargent, ‘The Background’; idem, ‘Convertibility’; Bulletin
of the Oxford University Institute of Statistics (ed.), The Future of the Sterling Area,
especially Scott, ‘What Should Be Done’. For the European dimension, see in
particular, Milward, European Rescue, ch. 7. For a brief survey of the literature, see
Greenwood, Britain, chs. 6, 7. A detailed, near-contemporary account of eco­
nomic relations is Camps, Britain. Macmillan’s role is stressed, for example, by
Reynolds, Britannia Overruled, ch. 8; Northedge, Descent from Power; also Holland,
‘The Imperial Factor’, p. 181. This assessment, it seems, is influenced by his
massive memoirs: Macmillan, Riding the Storm, idem, Pointing the Way.
2. See ch. 2, and for the broad perspective, Cain and Hopkins, British Imperialism.

The most authoritative study of these relationships is still Strange, Sterling, ch. 9.
A note by the Permanent Secretary of the Treasury, Sir Edward Bridges, of 7 Sep
1956 for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Harold Macmillan (PRO T 236/4188),
refers to ‘the vital necessity from the point of view of our currency and our econ­
omy of ensuring that we do not go it alone, and that we have the maximum U.S.
support’. On 9 Sep 1956, Macmillan added in handwriting: ‘Yes: this is just the
truth. U.S. are being very difficult.’ See also Dooley, ‘Great Britain’s “Last Battle”’;
Kunz, ‘Importance of Having Money’; idem, The Economic Diplomacy, pp. 143–62;
Yeager, International Monetary Relations, p. 388.
These amounted together to $561 million: Hall (T) to Makins (T), ‘Unused
Resources’, 15 Jan 1957, PRO T 236/4318; Rickett (T) to Rowan (T), ‘Unused
Resources’, 14 Jan 1957, PRO T 236/4318. Also Dooley, ‘Great Britain’s “Last

was judged that this was not required, under the assumption that the maximum

Macmillan, as Chancellor, reportedly favoured a floating pound, and was very
concerned about the liquidity problem in the developing world (see Brittan,
Steering, p. 124). It is interesting to observe in this connection that economists
such as Meade thought that the international liquidity problem was bound to
improve, if flexible exchange rates were introduced (see Scammell, The
International Economy, p. 117). There might thus have been some convergence
with interests of British manufacturing for reasons that had little to do with gov­
ernment support for industry in external economic policy. One advocate of a
floating pound in the Treasury was A.T.K. Grant: see idem, The Machinery of
Finance, p. 129.

106. Unfortunately, to my knowledge, there exists as yet no study that gives due
emphasis to the socio-economic underpinnings of Conservative Party politics.
It would be important to know to which backbenchers the new Prime Minister260 Notes
listened, and how the Conservative Party of 1951 differed from the one in
1957. For some indication, see Brittan, Steering, p. 124. For the changing stance
of industry towards Europe from 1957, see Blank, Industry, pp. 139–48.
107. Note that Prime Minister Macmillan, Chancellor Thorneycroft and Maudling,
the architect of policy on Europe, in the mid-1950s had held the posts of
Chancellor, President of the Board of Trade and Economic Secretary, respectively.
108. The line taken by the head of the Overseas Finance Division of the Treasury, Sir
Leslie Rowan, is particularly instructive. See a great number of references

9 The Sterling Empire and the International Economy:
Frictions with Cosmopolitan Britain, 1958 and Beyond
1. See the vast amount of studies in the 1960s, many of which were inspired by
Emerson, Empire to Nation; for a review, see Curtin, ‘Nationalism in Africa’.
However, more recent studies also accept such an interpretation. See, for exam­
ple, Iliffe, A Modern History of Tanganyika, ch. 16; Isichei, A History of Nigeria;
Hargreaves, Decolonization. By contrast, studies inspired by dependency theory
are mainly concerned with the effects on peripheral economic development
of the independence settlement. For a case study of Kenya, see Wasserman,
‘The Independence Bargain’, idem, ‘The Politics of Consensual Decolonization’,
idem, The Politics of Decolonisation.
2. See Ady, ‘Ghana’; Barback, ‘Nigeria’; and other studies in Bulletin of the Oxford
University Institute of Statistics (ed.), The Future of the Sterling Area. A more
recent study emphasizing the role of liberal multilateralism for development on
the periphery is Bangura, Britain and Commonwealth Africa, chs. 4 and 5. For
changes between the 1950s and 1960s, see also Fieldhouse, Black Africa. A sum­
mary account of relevant official documents is provided by Morgan, Official
History, vol. 3, chs. 4–7.
3. See, for example, studies in Newlyn (ed.), The Financing; also Fleetwood, Money
and Finance; for regional studies, see McKenna, ‘Financial Developments’; Drake,
Financial Development; Spinnler, Außenhandel Nigerias.
4. The present account is only concerned with general aspects that are relevant to
British external economic relations rather than with the detailed rationale of
various economic policies on the periphery. For an important case study (of
Malaya), see Drake, Financial Development.
5. Trade relations widened because of peripheral pressure and also because convert­
ibility was related to implementing IMF and GATT provisions. See, Patterson,
Discrimination. See also ch. 8.
6. This had been long in the making: see ch. 7. See also Jenkyns (T), ‘Notes on a

19. The move to convertibility implied eventually the acceptance of article VIII of
the IMF. Discrimination was then only possible in view of customs unions, or
special preferential arrangements for peripheral countries that were being nego­
tiated in the early 1960s under the new world trade rules of the GATT. For the
latter point, see Scammell, The International Economy, p. 167.

44. This does not mean that certain parts of British government departments,
notably in the Colonial Office, did not at times (for example, during the war or
the rearmament debate) advocate certain forms of industrial production in the
colonies. However, this did not constitute official British policy. For CO thinking
on the matter, see Butler, Industrialisation.

on the London market: see PRO CAOG 9/33; Ady, ‘Ghana’, pp. 321, 324. The
British attitude is illustrated by Loynes (B/E) to Governors (B/E), ‘Ghana:
Gbedemah’s Visit’, 25 Jul 1958, B/E OV 69/5/2766/3. Cf. also the contemporary
criticism of the misallocation of development finance within the sterling area:

55. By early 1957, key policy-makers had realized the reduced prospects of the impe­
rial sterling periphery in Britain’s external economic relations. For typical state­
ments, see Rowan (T), ‘External Economic Aims’, 31 Dec 1957, B/E OV

Sterling Area’, 10 May 1957, B/E ADM 14/49/808/1.
56. These views were shared by Professor W.A. Lewis, who acted as an independent
adviser to the Ghana government and participated in meetings with the Bank of
England. Otherwise, British government departments and the Bank appreciated
Lewis’s moderating influence concerning Ghana’s demands: Loynes (B/E) to

makers in Ghana might have had an influence in that respect. Cf., for example,

93. This dimension is sometimes ignored: for example, Schenk, ‘The Origins’.
94. This course is borne out particularly by the viewpoint expressed in the
Treasury’s Overseas Finance Division, and by the Bank of England adviser on
colonial matters, J.B. Loynes.
95. This stood in notable contrast to some of the suggestions for a reformed ster­
ling area floated in academic circles, such as the so-called Day-Shonfield thesis
which advocated preferential access for Ghana to the London money market.

17. As far as empires are concerned, this holds true for the German and Italian case.
Britain, France and Portugal fall outside this pattern, and are, therefore, of par­
ticular interest for research.
18. In this respect, though not regarding conclusions on ‘decolonization’, the pre­
sent argument is consistent with the literature focusing on the Colonial Office’s
‘official mind’, which argues that the Second World War constituted an impor­
tant discontinuity. See, for example, Crowder, ‘The Second World War: Prelude
to Decolonization in Africa’.

28. Discussed immediately below. Another document from mid-1950 which refers to
the end of the British empire was a mere public relations exercise by the
Colonial Office International Relations Department. This paper aimed at assuag­
ing US anti-colonial rhetoric and rallying American support in the United
Nations. The Colonial Office was always wary of the image of colonial rule. See
Hyam, The Labour Government and the End of Empire, part I, pp. 334–66: Colonial
Office International Relations Department, ‘The Colonial Empire Today;
Summary of Our Main Problems and Policies’. Significantly, this document also
falls in a period of reinvigorated discriminatory management of the empire. It
needs to be stressed, moreover, that the Colonial Office plans concerned with
changes in so-called native administration signal merely a change in administra­
tive doctrine. For pertinent remarks, see Westcott, JICH 11, 3 (1983), pp. 367–8
(reviewing Pearce, The Turning Point).

36. See PRO C.C. 42(57)4 of 22 May 1957. Equally, the agenda of the Prime
Minister’s 1957 Commonwealth Tour contained no references to an anticipated
withdrawal from the empire: ‘Cabinet. Committee on Prime Minister’s Com­
monwealth Tour. Capital Development and Confidence in Sterling. Note by the
Treasury. GEN.622/1/13’, 19 Dec 1957; ‘United Kingdom Overseas Investment

CAB 130/138.
37. Given this context, Macmillan’s policy review was by no means evenly poised,
nor were economic factors marginal, as suggested by Morgan, and followed by
various authors, such as Fieldhouse (quoted by Reynolds, Britannia Overruled,
p. 222; and by Austen, African Economic History, p. 210). Macmillan’s ‘hostility’
towards the empire (alleged by Holland, ‘The Imperial Factor’, p. 181) does not
appear to be a convincing explanation either.

In Sep 1958, a constitutional conference for Nigeria decided on self-government
for a Nigerian Federation, and discussed a defence agreement: PRO C.C. 71(58)5;270 Notes
52. C.C. 76(58)4 of 11 Sep 1958. Independence was, however, only approved in Feb
1960: PRO C.C.10(60)4 of 18 Feb 1960. See also the Loynes initiatives on
Nigerian central banking, ch. 9.
52. Kenya’s Constitutional Conference got under way early in 1960. See PRO
C.C.2(60)2, and PRO C.C.3(60)5, of 18 Jan 1960, PRO C.C.7(60)1 of 11 Feb 1960
and many more in the following months. Uganda was planned to come after
Tanganyika but earlier than the final arrangements for Kenya. See PRO
C.C.10(60)5 of 18 Feb 1960. In British Guiana, Britain hesitated because of local
problems: PRO C.C.15(60)7 of 6 Mar 1960. But under conditions she then
agreed to self-government to be scheduled for Aug 1961: PRO C.C.21(60)5 of 29
Mar 1960. For Sierra Leone, too, the Colonial Policy Committee recommended
that this territory should become independent towards the end of 1961, depend­
ing on financial and defence agreements: PRO C.C.25(60)3 of 11 Apr 1960.
Similarly, defence requirements were set for West Indian independence from
Britain and the United States: PRO C.C.57(60)2 of 8 Nov 1960. Meanwhile, the
constitutional future of so-called smaller territories continued to be discussed:
PRO C.C.57(60)8 of 8 Nov 1960.
53. For these approaches, see ch. 1.
54. For this context, see Baylis, Anglo-American Defence Relations, chs. 3 and 4.
55. The evidence provided by Horowitz, ‘Attitudes of British Conservatives Towards
Decolonization’, confirms this assessment. See also Murphy, Party Politics.
56. In this respect the present interpretation is consistent with Darwin, Britain and
Decolonisation, p. 202.
57. Horowitz, ‘Attitudes’.
58. The classic study of African nationalism was written prior to the event and pub­
lished in 1956: Hodgkin, Nationalism in Colonial Africa. The nationalism explana­
tion falls into a variety of sub-categories. An early view that attributes the end of
colonial rule to the diffusion of national ideas in the colonial world is Emerson,
Empire to Nation; also Strachey, The End of Empire; contemporary case studies
include Coleman, Nigeria; Kilson, ‘Nationalism’. Hargreaves, Decolonization in
Africa, emphasizes a controlled transfer of power to responsible nationalist leaders.
The socio-economic aspects of mass mobilization in relations to strikes and protest
actions figures more prominently in interpretations of the French case: for exam­
ple, Coquery-Vidrovitch, ‘Emeutes urbaines, grèves générales et décolonisation en
Afrique française’; also idem, Afrique noire; and M’Bokolo, ‘Forces sociales et idéolo­
gies dans la décolonisation de l’A.E.F.’; cf. also Kahler, Decolonization.
59. A number of colonial administrators quit their service for Britain in the early
1960s and became administrators for the newly independent governments.
Nationalists in Tanganyika (Tanzania), similar to settler representatives in Kenya,
in the late 1950s still expected independence not to be granted for about
another twenty years. See Iliffe, A Modern History of Tanganyika, pp. 562–6. For
Nigeria, compare O’Connell, ‘The Political Class’, p. 377.
60. See, Tignor, Capitalism and Nationalism; For case studies of the relationship
between British business and nationalists, see White, Business, idem, ‘British
Business’; and S.E. Stockwell, ‘Political Strategies and British Business’; compare
also Kahler, ‘Political Regimes’.
61. This is a popular view as well as one advanced by historians, though the defini­
tion of ‘crisis’ varies. See, for example, Robinson, ‘Non-European Foundations
of European Imperialism’; also Holland, European Decolonization. A somewhat
similar view seems to underpin Low, Eclipse of Empire.Notes 271
62. However, these issues were debated: See Memorandum by the Secretary of State
for the Colonies for the Cabinet, PRO C.M.(51)26. The Prime Minister also
expressed concerns about military costs in Malaya: see Cabinet Conclusion of
8 Nov 1951, PRO C.C.5(51)3. For histories of colonial emergencies in their own
right, see JICH, special issue, 3 (1993). Detailed recent research also questions
some traditional views on the prowess of insurgents in Malaya: see the review by
Hack, ‘The Malayan Emergency’; Stockwell, ‘“A Widespread and Long-Concocted
Plot” ’, argues that the British did not believe in a Communist conspiracy.
63. See chs. 4 and 5.
64. See Kennedy, The Rise and Fall; idem, ‘Strategy’; Martel, ‘The Meaning of Power’;
Northedge, Descent; from among surveys of international history Calvocoressi,
World Politics. In histories of the British empire, the Second World War is often
seen as the watershed. See, for example, Crowder, ‘The Second World War:
Prelude to Decolonization in Africa’. But such a view is rightly disputed, for
example, by Holland, European Decolonization. Extreme examples that advocate
imperial decline even before the Second World War are Beloff, Britain’s Liberal
Empire, p. 361; and Hyam, Britain’s Imperial Century, p. 377. Gallagher, The
Decline, discerns a brief revival for strategic reasons after the Second World War.
General publications on Britain’s decline usually subsume the loss of empire in
their lament. See, for example, Allen, The British Disease; Gamble, Britain in
Decline; Warwick, ‘Did Britain Change?’. A more refined analysis of Britain’s
overall ‘decline’ is Anderson, ‘The Figures of Descent’. For a criticism of explana­
tions of British economic decline and empire, see Tomlinson, ‘The Contraction
of England’.
65. This is the traditional view of diplomatic historians, often expressed in text­
books on international relations and international history. A typical example is
Grimal, Decolonization; also Ansprenger, Dissolution.

“Colonialism”. Note by the Colonial Office. GEN.518/6/14’, 14 Jun 1956, PRO

67. 14 Dec 1960: United Nations Declaration on the Independence of Colonial Countries,
1514 (XV).
68. Howe, Anticolonialism.
69. Political historians often capture the thrust of imperial policy without grasping
its underpinnings. See, for example, Goldsworthy: ‘Keeping Change Within
Bounds’.
70. See Cowen and Shenton, ‘The Origin and Course of Fabian Colonialism’.
71. See the concessions to Lancashire cotton manufacturers with regard to handling
competition from Hong Kong: PRO C.M.2(55)5 of 12 Apr 1955, C.M. 8(56)10 of
31 Jan 1956, C.C. 20(57)4 of 14 Mar 1957, C.C. 60(57)7 of 23 Jul 1957, C.C.

1958.
72. See Louis and Robinson, ‘Liquidation of Empire’; and Louis, ‘Anti-Colonialism’.
73. Horowitz argues that this was still the case in the late 1950s: ‘Attitudes’.
