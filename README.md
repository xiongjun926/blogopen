 Gladstone's “anxiety” marked the culmination of a decades-long movement that represented the Armenian cause as an imperial duty realized through British diplomacy. The vision found strongest expression in the person of Gladstone himself, described by one contemporary as a “humane man” with a “keen sense of the religious bearing of political questions.”11 Born in Liverpool in 1809 to a relatively prosperous, evangelical merchant family, his life and career spanned the nineteenth century. His father was a self-made man and sent the young Gladstone to Eton in 1821 and later to Christ Church at the University of Oxford. His education taught him self-reliance and helped him to forge important relationships with notable political and religious figures of the time. These experiences, according to his biographer, Colin Matthew, led to Gladstone's belief that the purpose of liberal education was to reinforce orthodox Anglican Christianity.12 His interest in orthodox religion during a period when Anglicanism was undergoing intense scrutiny from within led to a lifelong respect of the Eastern Orthodox Church as a unifying national and religious institution for Near Eastern peoples and would deeply influence his personal and political life.
 Religious, secular, and political advocacy organizations came to share this vision. They found inspiration in Gladstone's advocacy on behalf of Ottoman Christian minorities who belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Church which he had embraced in his early years. Eastern orthodoxy, many believed, belonged to a religion sharing a common origin with Anglicanism.22 Anglicans and Nonconformists alike embraced the cause, raising money and performing relief work in the Ottoman Empire.23 Such activism cast humanitarian intervention as a simultaneously moral, religious and imperial duty that Gladstone, shown as a Christian crusader in Figure 1.1, maintained would “serve civilization” (Figure 1.1). In 1876, advocates founded the Eastern Question Association as an umbrella organization to advocate for Ottoman minorities that included Bulgarian, Armenian, Assyrian, and Greek Orthodox Christians.24
 Links with the Ottoman Empire in general, and Armenia in particular, were further strengthened by understandings of the region as the cradle of civilization and the birthplace of Christianity. Critics maintained that the end of the Crimean War offered a new opportunity for the West to reconnect with its ancient past in the East. “Since the 17th century there has been but little direct intercourse between the Orthodox East and the Protestant West,” observed one journalist, “but the great events of the last few years, which have opened for England such a career in the East, cannot fail to bring the subject very prominently before every one.” Anglicanism symbolically rejoined Eastern Orthodox Christianity in its birthplace in the Holy Land with the building of a memorial church at Constantinople to commemorate the war and unite Britain “with the members of the ancient churches of the East.” The British built this Anglican Church as a war memorial. It was “assigned a conspicuous site upon the hills which crown the Bosporus” and represented “a trophy of our heroism and our faith.”35 A monument to Christianity and victory over its Russian rival, the church promised to unite Orthodox peoples with Anglicanism in the Holy Land. The memorial church still exists today.

 Across empires ideals of childhood held out the tantalising promise of tying  together societies composed of ‘settlers’ and ‘expatriates’ proclaiming diverse eth- nic affiliations. Recent histories have begun to revise older views of French and  British ‘communities’ in East and Southeast Asia as mere accomplices of impe- rial expansion, revealing these groupings of settlers, businessmen, officials and  religious workers instead as fractured and fissiparous. Robert Bickers, Christian  Henriot, Eric Jennings, J. P. Daughton and others have revealed that they were  rarely committed to any overarching programme or imperial aim.11 In the face  of such diversity, those determined to assert the nation on the ‘frontier’ rallied  behind more aloof genres of colonialism. As they built claims for racial differ- ence upon evidence of the impossibility of white settlement, childhood became a  key resource through which racial difference could be defined. Consequently, the  question of how to raise children in nonsettlement colonies linked the ‘low prag- matism’ of colonialism, as Bickers and Henriot have termed it, with high politics.12
 Far from being the ‘indirect rule’ with which the British Empire was often as- sociated, governance in the British Crown Colonies of Hong Kong and the Straits  Settlements was intentionally direct. Both formed part of an imperial system  with a constitutional structure that confined merchant power, closed off wider  representation and concentrated power in nonelective executive and legislative councils and a governor (who was monitored by the Colonial Office and parlia- ment).76 This system was intended to avoid the pitfalls of ‘older’ colonialisms, in  particular those of British India where large Anglo-Indian and poor white pop- ulations had come to be condemned as a problem, and centres such as Shanghai,  where municipal government endowed ‘settlers’ with a powerful voice.77
 Following the uprising a British parliamentary select committee reappraised  conditions in India. The committee endorsed a new vision of state-run coloni- alism as more distant and aloof. Authorities perceived entanglement—for which  they held settlers primarily responsible—as blurring the lines of racial identity  and eroding authority. This shift heralded a quite different political vision of the  colonial future and one that clashed with the interests of planters in India, many  of whom had raised children there. It was in the teeth of settler resistance to this  new line that medical authorities in the pay of the state marshalled arguments  based upon evidence of children’s health behind attempts to prove the impossi- bility of white settlement. These medical and administrative interventions had the  effect of producing European children in colonial India as the ultimate symbol of  white racial endangerment and of the degenerative impact of the tropics. Young  people’s vulnerability made them exemplars of national cultures whose exotic  bodies served as a site of ‘essential’ civilisational difference. Children’s presence  came to validate claims for the tropics as endangering whites, but also, by exten- sion, assumptions that geographical dislocation offered proof of a civilisational  superiority that was fixed in the environment.14
 The notional distinction between ‘true’ childhood—voiced by Knollys in Hong  Kong—and that which was not childhood in the true sense of the word emerged  in the wake of liberal reformers’ efforts to advance child protection through state  intervention. In the mid-nineteenth century, metropolitan child labour reformers established the economically worthless, domestic childhood as a middle-class  ideal. This ideal was driven into sharper relief after 1870 as evangelical-inspired  activists and school attendance officers laboured to achieve its extension across  class lines. In Britain, Enlightenment thinking had advanced assumptions of the  supposedly essential malleability of children and their special receptiveness to  environmental influences. Reformers therefore focused not only upon longer- term solutions to address the moral and physical problems of the labouring poor,  such as urban renewal, but also on the retrieval and reform of children from  working-class milieux.
 It did not take long for the impact of this social movement to ripple out to  empire, where the Contagious Diseases Acts had originated. The first was im- plemented in 1857 in Hong Kong, while a second, passed in 1867, had provided  police there with additional powers.16 The success of the metropolitan reformers’  campaign tactics soon led them to extend their critique to the colonies. And as  demands for the repeal of the acts extended to empire, so too did other aspects  of the purity movement. The 1880s emerged as a period of reflection upon sin at  home and abroad. Stead’s Pall Mall Gazette published an article in which ‘Public  Servant’ asked, “Is Empire Consistent with Morality?” (He answered the question  with a resounding “No!”)17 For a growing number of critics the male-dominat- ed society of empire ‘commissioned sin,’ and in light of this elite commentators  argued for imperial reform through the introduction of domestic values, that is,  through the presence of wives, families and children.
 Sir John Pope Hennessy, the reform-minded governor of Hong Kong, was  keenly aware of such criticisms. During his governorship (1877–82) the Crown  Colony had repeatedly come under fire from both metropolitan campaigners and  its own liberal-minded chief justice for its lax moral standards. Hennessy himself initiated an inquiry into aspects of Hong Kong’s Contagious Diseases Ordinance  but failed to convince the Colonial Office to repeal it. Struggling to defend the  colonial record amid condemnation of the acts (which remained on the statute)  and evidence of ‘child slavery’ (discussed in Chapter 8), he turned to census data  to argue, “The tropical Colony where European children flourish cannot be very  unhealthy.”18 Drawing a veil over disastrous sanitary conditions, brothel slavery  and other problems, Hennessy connected ‘progress’ with the proliferating pres- ence of European children ‘Out East.’ The governor was not alone in identifying the presence of the European child  as a barometer of imperial-moral health. As the medical and social costs of male  profligacy to British imperialism came under attack, other residents of Brit- ish-governed territories in Asia joined this chorus. Alicia Little, a travel writer,  anti-footbinding campaigner and sometime resident of Shanghai, attacked the  old bachelor-dominated ‘mess system,’ claiming that “the greatest change of all”  was “the superseding of the old hong life by family life. Shanghai is full, happi- ly, now of ladies and children and they have broken up the junior messes.”19 In  Singapore, Dr. David Galloway, a Scottish medical doctor who had arrived in the  Straits in 1895, celebrated children as corroborating the ideal of the dutiful wife  as mother.20 In Hong Kong the chaplain to the resident British armed forces, the  Reverend E. J. Hardy, explained in a lecture of 1903 how “wife and children are a  kind of discipline” in the tropics. For these commentators, children’s presence in  empire was suggestive of a sexually disciplined colonial masculinity. The family  with children, in their view, might provide a far more authentic foundation for  social order built around the home than could bachelorhood in the messes and  chummeries.21 Trans-colonially, ‘true children’ emerged as a corrective to empire’s  ‘spoilt children.’22
 In this vein, in 1889 James Cantlie, by then one of Hong Kong’s foremost medi- cal doctors, declared before a meeting of the Hong Kong Literary Society, “A home means in its essential sense a place wherein children can be reared.”23 Having  arrived in Hong Kong two years earlier with his wife and baby son, Cantlie was  himself engaged with the challenge of realising the colonial home. Whilst in the  metropole, he had authored Degeneration amongst Londoners (1885) and played a  leading role in ‘Tropicalising’ readings of the labouring poor in London’s slums.24  In Hong Kong, this prominent though controversial supporter of the domestica- tion of metropolitan male working-class culture underlined the essentially degen- erative impact of the tropical environment upon children’s health. Nevertheless  he clung, like Hennessy, to the notion of the child as barometer of the moral health  of a community being redefined in terms of ‘exile.’ The commentaries of Cantlie and others drew their power from metropolitan  notions of mother and child as a powerful moral unit. These had deep historical  roots, being tangled up in Britain with Puritan traditions of the family and mar- riage. From the 1840s, evangelical writers, congregational ministers, temperance  and moral reformers and physicians invoked ideals of the family as an affective  relationship, and the home as a sacred and intimate space, separated from the  outside world of work, competition, the market and politics. Adultery and com- mercial sex embodied in the figure of the prostitute or ‘public woman’ contra- vened the spiritual essence of reproductive sexual union in the home. Through  the close links it developed with the reform of labour practices, philanthropy  and evangelicalism, childhood for some educated observers came to represent an  essentially ethical space, a space of innocence and one ideally to be protected.25  As James Cantlie was at pains to emphasise, in the tropics it was children and not  their mothers who assumed the mantle of supreme referents of the ‘home,’ and  by extension European civilisational superiority.
 Members of the influential and ideologically diverse French colonial lobby  (or Union Coloniale Française) found the prospect of settlement in ‘new France’  tantalising. As Marie-Paule Ha has shown, lobbyists threw their weight behind a  fin de siècle campaign promoting women’s emigration to the colonies, organised  by the Société Française D’Émigration des Femmes.55 While others supported  emigration partly as a solution to fin de siècle problems of depopulation and  a ‘blocked’ metropolitan marriage market, the colonial lobbyist Joseph Chail- ley-Bert identified it as a means of ensuring that the French colonial presence in  Asia would not only persist but take on a higher social tone. In the propaganda  whipped up around this campaign supporters advocated the careful selection of  women capable of ‘improving’ colonial societies which were considered at this  time in France to comprise felons, frauds and fruits secs. But the presence of  these women was also a means to an end: the production of a new generation of  children capable of upholding and performing Frenchness authentically in a way  that critics argued mixed-race children born of unions between male colonials  and native women were not.
 British doctors and hygienists in Hong Kong and Singapore dwelt primarily on tropicality as a threat to population quality to be resolved by an early return to the  metropole. Assumptions about gender in empire and the imperative of return led  them to concede somewhat greater authority to mothers over their own children.  By contrast, in Hanoi and Saigon some experts identified the management of  childhood in the tropics as fundamental to aspirations that empire might form  part of a project of national regeneration. Hence, at a time when in the metro- pole French men increasingly conceded responsibility for their children to an  emerging partnership between women and the interventionist republican state,  in colonial contexts where the state was weaker and culture was more male-dom- inated and masculinist, experts and fathers reasserted paternal responsibility for  colonial childhood.
 Cultural Contagions: Children in the Colonial home s In the late imperial era childrearing came to be identified as exemplary of moral  order and good governance came to be more closely linked to domestic values.  The home emerged as a site of colonial power, and in the process children took  on a social and cultural significance that far outstripped their numerical presence  in the tropics. As adults recast children as exemplars of supposedly homogeneous  national cultures, their actions within the home—their encounters with native  servants, nursemaids, and others—began to attract interest at the highest levels  of colonial society. As we have seen, hygienists, some of whom viewed children as  ‘perfected degenerates’ and others as ‘acclimated auxiliaries,’ became deeply con- cerned with childrearing practices. And yet these experts were only too well aware  that they lacked influence over the shape and structure that colonial childhoods  ultimately took within the home. In practice, as this chapter argues, childhood in  colonial contexts was profoundly porous, mixed and disruptive of the very claims  for racial homogeneity that it was called upon to impart.
 To be sure, such checks constantly broke down. For instance, European chil- dren overcame incomprehension by learning Asian languages or pidgin English.  Some taught their amahs European languages too. Though common languages emerged, Europeans checked amahs’ authority by denigrating these as essentially  ‘childish.’ From the mid-nineteenth century, Canton pidgin English was frequent- ly derided by European observers as a “gross caricature of the language of the  nursery” and a “barbarous and childish patois.”25 By construing pidgin, which  by the turn of the century had all but disappeared from commercial domains, as  an essentially childish tongue used in the home, commentators accommodated  it within British elite assumptions about childhood as a separate ‘world,’ distinct  from that of adults.
 In this regard, the child-servant relationship mirrored the child-environment  relationship discussed in Chapter 2. Since Asian servants were often regarded as  ‘outgrowths’ of this environment, this is hardly surprising. Both relationships  locked children into a trajectory leading inevitably to degeneracy and the end  of innocence. But both were also ultimately productive of British elite colonial  culture. They affirmed middle-class women’s elite status and underpinned the  orthodoxy of sending children ‘Home.’ This allowed colonial homes to remain  primarily spaces of childhood. The adolescent in the colonial home by contrast  embodied the alarming prospect that intimate relations set down across lines of  class and race might persist into adulthood. Lord Northcliffe, visiting Singapore,  summed this problem up quite succinctly, and its solution, when he noted: “The  European children here seem happy. I saw them playing today guarded by their  Chinese or Malay amahs of whom they are very fond. These nurses spoil them,  however, and they have to be ordered home when they are seven years of age.”36
 In Hong Kong, Singapore and other contexts, childhood had come to be close- ly linked to moral reform. In effect, the colonial childhood rested upon theories  of disease conflating physical and moral health and dirtiness. These produced the  Chinese child as distinct, as the quote from Phoebe May above illustrates. With  purity under threat, from outside and inside, ideal childhood required displace- ment beyond the impure. Prophylactic measures intended to control microbes,  pathogens and disease vectors focused upon the invasive agency of the Asian (and Eurasian) child. The resulting interventions underpinned assumptions that  ‘public’ health was secured in domestic spaces. But paradoxically, as this view of  childhood was elaborated trans-colonially, it produced efforts toward the hy- gienic regulation of the home in British contexts that were notably less didactic  than in Saigon and Hanoi.
 In January 1861 F. R. Kendall, an agent for the Peninsular and Oriental Steam  Navigation Company resident in Singapore observed, “No one here seems to take  an interest in Christmas somehow. . . . There is nothing to remind one of the sea- son at all.”5 When Charles Buckley organised his first Christmas gathering a few  years later it drew only twenty participants, mostly from his small Sunday school  class at St. Andrew’s Church. However, the celebration soon began to attract wider  interest. Buckley’s philanthropic gesture resonated among members of the small  merchant-dominated community as it gave greater public prominence to a cer- tain idea of British leadership and civil values at a moment when Singapore’s  elite was seeking to draw closer to London. Singapore had long been an Indian  dependency, but by the mid-1860s its merchants were petitioning London for  separate Crown Colony status. Before the onset of formal colonial rule in 1867 the  shared ambition to break free of rule by the East India Company sustained the early development of collaborative interethnic relations between European elites,  Chinese merchants (towkay) and English-speaking ‘Straits Chinese.’ In Singapore,  permanent communities of Chinese (mainly of Hokkien descent) predated for- mal British rule, as did the ‘Peranakan,’ Malay-speaking ancestors of early mi- grants from Penang and Malacca. Though they had resided in port cities of Asia  for centuries and married into Malay communities, this group retained aspects  of Chinese identity. However, many Chinese emigrants who settled also became  part of an Anglophone community and took on key roles in the growing admin- istrative and commercial life of the city. For example, Chinese merchants emerged  as members of government boards and voluntary institutions and as justices of  the peace. The Singapore Chamber of Commerce, the only formal organisation  of the early colonial period, created in February 1837 to communicate with the  London government, was open to all.6
 Far from confining themselves to domestic interiors, educated women were at  this time taking an increasingly prominent role in public.33 In British elite culture  new notions of childhood, sentimentalised and sacralised, were an accompani- ment to the domestic ideal of womanhood. The stark contrast between this elite  norm and the ‘waifs and strays,’ ‘hooligans’ or ‘street arabs’ who could not live  up to it galvanised a flurry of action intended to improve the condition of poor  children. Evangelical reformers increasingly saw their own children as adjuncts  in a battle to reverse the secularisation of society, and to raise its moral tone.  The initiatives of middle-class organisers such as the Boys’ Clubs and Institute  movement that had emerged in London in the 1870s and the Boys’ Brigade (1883)  reflected the desire to tap the energies of children and to address the yawning class  divide. Some feared that if evangelical zeal did not infect the younger generation  of ‘smart little children,’ momentum would be lost.
 Carabelli’s proposal and the response it received were also significant for the  light they shed upon a wider and increasingly bitter battle over whom or what  Indochina was actually for. In the metropole republicans and Catholics had by  now drawn battle lines penetrating the home. For each, the family offered a model around which society might be reorganised, and children figured prom- inently in their competing visions of the nation. For republicans children were  model democratic citizens-in-training, as the antislavery campaigner Victor  Schœlcher had famously suggested.59 For Catholics the family was a space for  the socialising of children and countering secularism. In a context of growing  religious strife in France the influential work of the late mining engineer and  conservative sociologist Frédéric Le Play informed a rising tide of right-wing  criticism blaming the decline of patriarchy upon an effeminising, egalitarian  republic.60 As J. P. Daughton has shown, these debates also played out at one  remove in colonial space. And here, in centres where patriarchal ideologies re- mained deeply ingrained, the colonial government’s willingness to entertain  notions of children as partners or auxiliaries of the state raised fears over a direct  threat to Catholic authority.61
 revolutionary philosophical tradition, from the ‘assimilationist’ approach of Paul  Bert to the more aloof ‘association’ of Jules Harmand. Casting the colonised as  a child sidestepped the oxymoron of an aristocratic republican rule and neatly  encapsulated the shift away from assimilation toward an associative line.
 Young people’s prominence in the public disturbances of the postwar era  posed a special problem for colonial elites. They had made children and child- hood symbolically central to justifications of liberal imperialism. But in the ear- ly twentieth century the young generation appeared to be leading anticolonial protest. Reform-minded Asian elites grasped for the symbolism of childhood  as they pursued nation-building agendas. Moreover, newly created international  organisations, in particular the League of Nations in Geneva (founded in January  1920), championed universal ideals of childhood as a basis upon which to rebuild  the postwar order. Drawing at times upon the moral leverage of such new inter- national agencies, Asian reformers highlighted disparities between Western and  non-Western childhoods and critiqued prewar narratives of empire as paternal  and benevolent. These criticisms exposed the peril of building justifications of  liberal governmentalities around appeals to unstable categories of youth.
 In the years before Duy Tân came to the throne, the conditions that led French  officials to arrange his accession took shape. At the turn of the century, cross-bor- der links with Canton, ironically facilitated by French modernisation projects, enabled young reform-minded individuals to tap into new ideas about mod- ernisation in the restive territories of northern Vietnam. The Qing emperor’s  abortive ‘Hundred Days Reform’ of China from 1898 provided inspiration. These  reforms resonated with special force among young intellectuals in northern Vi- etnam because here Chinese cultural influence remained evident in Vietnamese  traditions, institutions and beliefs. The ongoing battle for reform in China con- tinued to inspire young antiforeign and reform-minded elements in Vietnam  who were convinced that the limits of traditional sociopolitical organisation had  been reached.
 In the early 1920s, in centre after centre organisers struggled to start league  branches up again or closed them down definitively. In Singapore the Ministering  Children’s League shrank back within the confines of St. Andrew’s Cathedral be- fore finally closing in the autumn of 1923, with “no hope of revival.”27 In Penang,  the branch closed in 1922 but reopened in 1924, though by the early 1930s its  membership had slipped to just thirty children. This mirrored a general decline  in the organisation’s global membership to four hundred branches and 24,000  members and associates by 1924.
 Social networks linked the Kuk with the Tung Wah ‘Chinese Hospital,’ the ultimate  symbol of elite Chinese philanthropy in Hong Kong. Within and around these  institutions a coherent, local and mostly self-made elite emerged. As Elizabeth  Sinn has shown, many of its members saw philanthropy as “an instrument that  makes financial worth symbolically equivalent to moral worth” and believed that  the “dispensation of charity legitimises the accumulation of wealth.”37 The dy- namism of the league in Hong Kong following the admission of Chinese girls to  its structures reflected its value to these wealthy entrepreneurs. Class may have  failed to function as a bridge to interracial mixing in other social settings, as John  Carroll has shown (and Chinese continued to be excluded from European club  memberships for adults), but the league offered a space where elite Chinese and  European children could act as something closer to equals.38
 As the colonial government’s interventions in areas such as immigration pol- icy raised fears among Chinese that their interests and privileges were being en- croached upon, spokesmen for the Straits Chinese used Baby Shows to reassert  their claims upon modern, elite standards of living. Those who took up this task  were, significantly, among the most forward-looking and intellectually engaged  sections of Chinese society. The Nanyang Chinese Students Society (with the  support of the Children’s Aid Society) emerged to take over the running of Baby  Shows in Singapore by 1934. The events modelled a radically denaturalised, trans- formative conception of Chineseness predicated upon the disciplined hygienic  modernness of the child, and a vision of the family as a unit of consumption  and not only production.69 Chinese organisers proved far less anxious to insulate  children and childhood against the commercial orientation of the shows. Held  at the site of the Great World Cabaret, fancy dress competitions, concerts and  commercial goings-on all but overshadowed the medical authority on display.
 ‘generat ional tensions’ :   saigon and the semaines  de l’enfance As wider tensions unsettled established iconographies of colonial childhood,  new visions emerged to shore up the administration’s disintegrating moral claims for empire. The most important centre in this was again Saigon, as the principal  venue for open intellectual critiques of colonialism. Because Saigon’s elites resided  in a colony, not a protectorate, more liberal-minded residents anticipated their  city might play a key role in evidencing ‘progress.’ Here Cochinchinese elites used  public print media and other means to discuss international affairs, and there  had long been a greater sense of contact with Europe. Urban intellectuals also  wrote about the extremes of wealth and poverty they observed. They refracted  their reflections through new political lenses as they engaged with the question  of how France was treating the races whose progress it championed. A rising  tide of criticism, both French and Vietnamese, provided a mutual stimulus to  philanthropic action.83
 intimate heights: Children, Nature and Colonial urban planning s In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Europeans looked to the man- agement of the middle-class home and public displays of children in new rituals to  evidence a general reordering of empires along more ‘moral’ lines. But as children  migrated toward the epicentre of colonialisms’ cultures, elites extrapolated ideals  of childhood from the home into planning policies launched from the highest  levels of the colonial state. In particular, stakeholders marshalled childhood be- hind deeply controversial projects for the segregation of space. Demands for racial  enclaves turned quite explicitly upon the needs of children, or more specifically  what adults defined as their needs. The management of space emerged as another  crucial domain in which elite ideals of childhood linked up with colonial policy  and transformed the relationship of empire.
 However, this new disease paradigm never entirely overcame indifference and  even resistance within the Colonial Office and the colonies. New theories of the  vectoral propagation of disease only slowly won adherents in the colonies. Be- cause bacteriology connoted special expertise and planning at one remove, it sat  uneasily with the pragmatism that the British claimed to cherish in their empire.  The new perspective from the laboratory—hidden in the field—was one that  allowed foreign experts to rival the authority of administrators. It jarred with  desires to hem back social commitments by the state, and conflicted with visions  of imperial authority grounded in established environmental interpretations of  racial vulnerability, and their associated hierarchies. Instead of bringing about ex- tensive investment in public health, these new findings therefore often informed  planning interventions that shored up established orthodoxies. One of them was  that safety lay in the imposition of greater social and physical distance, not simply  between coloniser and colonised but between wealthier and less wealthy sections  of the populace.10 As planners sought to realise prophylactic segregation in major  centres in British Asia, these tensions inspired a revival of enclaves built around  the fragile, contested constituency of the European child.
 Claud Severn and his successors were well aware that measures intended to  split ‘settler’ sentiment might incur the wrath of elite Chinese. However, they seem  to have remained optimistic that the most important sections of Chinese opinion  would ultimately accept another reservation. This was perhaps partly because, as  we saw in Chapter 5, childhood was by this time reaching new levels of significance  as the focal point of a vibrant culture of elite, interethnic collaboration.74
 The presence of agricultural colonists had a far-reaching impact upon the  social tone of expatriate communities. Planters had grown accustomed to seeing  themselves as a kind of ‘landed gentry’ in British Malaya. However, as rubber pric- es bottomed out, their growing precariousness compelled them to divest many  trappings of elite family life. They cancelled plans to take home leave and to send  children home to be educated. As the crisis lengthened, planters complained of  feeling that “most married people are to be marooned here for ever.”115 In these  circumstances some began to emphasise a more radical line and they marshalled  dystopic visions of the degenerate European child behind a campaign for eco- nomic redress.
 After writing again to the Straits Times on 24 September to condemn confessional  groups, Allan (or his associates) drew the row to the attention of the Protestant  Educational Institute in London (established to ‘fight Popery’ in England), which  took up the case with the Colonial Office.18 The Colonial Office demanded that  the governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Frederick Weld, make a full report to  colonial secretary, Edward Stanhope, on 24 January 1887.
 As we can see, in the face of provocative claims for the toleration of child slavery  across Asia, British and French officials developed quite similar, defensive re- sponses. As moral reform swept onto the metropolitan agenda, in Britain after the  outcry over the Contagious Diseases Acts and the scandal created by W. T. Stead’s  exposé on child prostitution or “white slavery,” and in France as successive gov- ernments sought to establish the secular values of a modernising republicanism,  European and Asian merchants in empire centres feared these revelations might provoke heavy-handed metropolitan intervention. So too did colonial officials  keen to preserve stability and to avoid ‘unnecessary’ expenditure. However, flat  denials that slavery could not exist where it had no legal status were no longer suf- ficient. Therefore, instead of attacking what Smale, Allan, Silvestre and Landes had  all identified as linked practices of child cession, domestic servitude and brothel  slavery, colonial governments eschewed abolitionist intervention and played for  time or used orientalist arguments to deflect criticism.
 Effectively sinicising what was patently a community-wide problem required  more careful official oversight in more ethnically plural Singapore than it did  in Hong Kong. Consequently, in Singapore the Kuk came to be seen not as a  Chinese philanthropic initiative but as “a Government scheme worked by the  Chinese Protectorate.”27 Acting colonial secretary C.W.S. Kynnersley boasted, “No  Chinaman is employed in a position of authority higher than a Revenue officer  or a detective.”28 And while European suspicions of the Po Leung Kuk in Hong  Kong resulted in a critical enquiry into its work, when Elizabeth Andrew and the American medical missionary Dr. Katherine Bushnell complained in 1894 that “a  systematic slave trade in girls exists at Singapore,” the government flatly refused  an enquiry into the Straits Kuk.29
 The Colonial Office was prepared to accept this line, but in the febrile postwar  context reform-minded evangelical progressives infused with the sense that the  moment for change had arrived, were not. Soon after, Hugh Haslewood, a lieuten- ant commander of the Royal Navy posted to the Naval Chart Depot, and his wife,  Clara, who arrived in the colony in the summer of 1919, emerged as vociferous  critics of the phenomenon. Alerted to the issue by a sermon delivered at St. John’s  Cathedral on the subject of girl bond servants, Clara Haslewood publicised their  plight by writing a series of letters to Hong Kong newspapers castigating colonial  authorities for tolerating “child slavery.”58
 Frustrated by their inability to undermine this defence, the Haslewoods began  to emphasise the mui tsai system as synonymous with the abuse of young children.  By focusing on a specific, age-related vulnerability, they linked their cause to a  lively contemporaneous debate over adoption in Britain and abuses stemming  from regulatory shortcomings.60 By locating bond service at the extreme end of a  range of objectionable forms of labour impacting upon children under colonial  rule, they also connected their campaign to noisy, concurrent condemnations of  child labour in other colonial contexts, notably evangelical-led protests in other  major centres along the China coast.61 These aligned neatly with the critiques of  influential experts in Geneva keen to monitor colonial governments’ ‘civilising’  claims.
 The Haslewoods tapped into a narrative of child rescue that had special reso- nance in the British metropolitan context. From the 1830s, British reformers’ as- sertions that every child had the right to an ideal childhood advanced in conjunc- tion with demands for labour reform. In struggles to extend legislative protection  and free, compulsory education, reformers constructed childhood as vulnerable  and ideally noneconomic, protected and happy. Evidence of the denial of this ideal  presented moral reformers with a powerful tool. And as the Haslewoods and their  supporters drew upon the emotive weight of the unfree child, the momentum  began to shift in their favour.62
 The Hong Kong government and its defenders were on difficult ground. Leo  Amery, undersecretary of state for the colonies, found himself defending bond  service as a customary ‘unfreedom’ comparable to that of a ‘normal’ British child- hood, arguing, “I do not think that even in this country either adopted or other  children can always get away as freely as they would like, and perhaps that is  sometimes a good thing for them.”65 Amery’s point was that the notion of a ‘free’  child was nonsensical, predicated as it was upon the suspension of liberty within  the authoritarian structure of the family. However, equating the ideal childhood  in Britain to bond service in China was risky at a time when reformers were draw- ing attention to the most lurid aspects of the mui tsai system and childhood had  emerged at the forefront of liberal internationalist efforts to reshape the postwar  order. Moreover, by now in Hong Kong an increasingly vociferous ‘Anti–Mui Tsai  Society’ (established in September 1921) led by Chinese Christians with support  from local labour guilds was undermining a defence based upon cultural sensi- tivity to ‘Chinese’ norms and values. Dismantling the mui tsai system was a key  goal of nationalists and Christian Chinese who identified childhood as crucial to  nation building. In August the same year, Dr. Yeung Shiu Chuen, who became the  society’s secretary, attacked the system as inimical to Chinese ‘prestige’ and ‘civili- sation,’ and as “producing a low grade nation.”66 In 1922 the group appealed to the  Legislative Council for abolition on the grounds that mui tsai were slaves. With  the orientalist defence in tatters the government in London finally decided to act.
 This shift came about in part because, as Rachel Leow has also argued, the  report presented new evidence that unfree child labour existed not only among  Chinese but also among others, notably the Malay.83 The trans-racial dimensions  of this problem had long been known, as revealed by the case of Elizabeth above.  So what prompted the government to dispense with the older convenience of  the orientalist mui tsai strategy and to embrace the report? Crucially, by the late 1930s new circumstances connected the fate of unpaid child labourers to wider  debates over public health, the controversial issue of the Singapore naval base and  the ‘United Malaya’ project. In 1919 embarrassing revelations of the government’s  toleration of brothels led to metropolitan criticism of Singapore as the ‘Cesspool  of the East.’84 The government would eventually ban prostitution in 1927 and make  brothels illegal in 1930. But these measures did not prevent venereal disease and  they motivated the pugnacious Straits Settlements Association and its allies to  launch public attacks upon brothel closure. These campaigners rejected the ‘ex- pertise’ of ‘do-gooders’ “sitting at the other side of the world” and even demanded  the reenactment of the Contagious Diseases Ordinance.85
 In a context where serious political concessions were impossible the gov- ernment by now urgently required new evidence to underpin its claims to be a  ‘benevolent bureaucracy.’88 However, this need stemmed less from the need to  address Chinese protests than from desires to accelerate ‘decentralisation,’ a policy  intended to bring the Malay Peninsula more closely under British control. Much  earlier, in 1926, Governor Laurence Guillemard (1919–27) had set out this goal by  insisting that the “various parts of Malaya can only attain their full development  by working together as members of one united Malaya.”89 Picton-Turbervill’s re- port emerged at a time when Governor Shenton Thomas sought a means of ad- dressing both the political controversy of the ‘Social Question’ and the challenge  of unification.
 This was why, when the furore over mui tsai had risen again in 1929, officials  in Hong Kong had leapt to ‘fairyland’s’ defence. G.E.J. Gent of the Colonial Of- fice received reports of new voluntary initiatives, pushing out the boundaries of  charitable child welfare still further. These included the establishment of a Hong  Kong branch of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children  (NSPCC).96 Others, such as the police-run Waifs and Strays club, also emerged as  part of this defensive reaction. The governor of Hong Kong, Sir Cecil Clementi, a  staunch opponent of the compulsory inspection of mui tsai, presided at the inau- gural meeting of Hong Kong’s branch of the SPCC in January 1930. According to  him, the allocation of funds demonstrated the colonial government’s attachment  of “so much importance to this matter [the protection of children].”97 Soon after,  Clementi left Hong Kong to take up the governorship of the Straits Settlements,  but he continued to describe the mui tsai legislation as a disaster for poor children,  whom he believed were better catered for as bond servants within the elite family.98
 Official histories of Hong Kong emerging in the 1930s set up paternal coun- terclaims to female reformers’ demands by recasting British colonial governance  within a surprisingly sentimental frame. Officials here had long eschewed meta- phors of nature or kinship in preference for a discourse of development as ration- al, technologically competent progress. This had often portrayed Hong Kong as a  triumph over nature, a ‘barren rock’ transformed into a showcase of British-led  modernisation.99 Now, however, officials began to indulge in paternal referenc- es to the Crown Colony’s former ‘infancy.’ It was significant that their gaze was  retrospective, that they claimed to be looking back on the child-colony from the  perspective of a present in which it was already ‘mature’ (in contrast to a young  and turbulent China over the border). For such views negated justifications for external intervention and ushered female reformers towards the anachronistic  position of belittling a colony that had already ‘grown up.’100
 Part of the reason was because religious authorities in France, Hanoi and Sai- gon were far less inclined than their British equivalents to use evidence of ‘unfree’  children to attack the colonial government. Historians reflecting on the charac- teristics of antislavery movements more generally, prior to and during this peri- od, have contrasted a powerful British antislavery movement possessing a broad,  evangelical mass power base with a French equivalent suffering from long-stand- ing divisions.119 Certainly, the establishment of Cardinal Lavigerie’s Anti-Slavery  Society in 1888 had seen the French Catholic Church overcome associations of  abolition with revolution to emerge at the forefront of a reinvigorated metropol- itan antislavery movement. However, the society focused its efforts largely upon  western and equatorial Africa—areas of empire where Christian influence had yet  to be consolidated—not Indochina, where the French Catholic presence in Asia  long predated, and inspired, formal colonial rule.
 Moreover, as the republican state rolled back clerical privilege at home, rep- resentatives of the Church preferred to work tactfully, not confrontationally,  alongside authorities in the colonies.120 In Saigon and Hanoi religious authorities  enjoyed support from influential figures within the administration and used sub- tle pressure rather than open propaganda to address controversial social issues.121  The Anti-Slavery Society adopted a notably emollient tone in correspondence  with Governor Albert Sarraut, dismissing allegations that slavery was still tolerat- ed in Indochina.122 Perhaps this is unsurprising, since the society’s president from  11 October 1909 was none other than Charles-Marie Le Myre de Vilers, Cochinchi- na’s first civil governor, who had failed to act on Silvestre and Landes’s calls to  openly confront child slavery.
 The quite different political preoccupations of French feminist-led and  left-orientated antitrafficking organisations were also important in obstructing the emergence of a broad-based challenge to the official line. Metropolitan anti- trafficking movements (with which various feminist groups aligned) had taken  up leading positions in international efforts in this field before the First World  War. Like the British women’s movement, the French antitrafficking movement  had developed out of late-nineteenth-century fears over the abduction of women  into prostitution, or la traite des blanches. Campaigners identified the toleration of  brothel registration as the primary cause of this problem. In Britain, the success  of the women’s movement in achieving the repeal of the Contagious Diseases  Acts encouraged a broader focus. After winning suffrage through the 1918 Rep- resentation of the People Act (at least for women over thirty), British reformers  could afford to turn their attention to improving the condition of other vulnera- ble groups, notably children, empire-wide. In contrast, French feminists suffered  repeated setbacks in the struggle for suffrage and other social and legal rights and  this severely curtailed the scope of their demands.127
 Alice Conklin has persuasively argued that the French perceived their com- mitment to safeguarding freedom in the colonies as qualitatively superior to that  of other nations. Republican France, she notes, “prided itself, and its colonialism,  as achieving, if nothing else, an end to slavery in its colonies.”136 With economic  difficulties threatening to fragment the liberal centre in Europe critical voices fell  quiet. At a time when a broad consensus was emerging in metropolitan France  that empire was quintessentially humane, even critics such as Viollis appeared to  be “inhibited by her own Republicanism” while those on the left, such as Lou- is Roubaud, vaunted colonisation as the “essential condition for success” in the  antislavery campaign, and proposed cooperation on this front between British  Malaya, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Siam.137
 From the early 1920s colonial officials had begun to slant reports sent to League  inspectors in this direction. Questionnaire replies typically indicated, “Police ac- tion is very delicate in affairs relating specifically to the Chinese.”144 If this was a problem, it was largely one of the government’s own making. From 1871 to 1885  the French authorities permitted Chinese in Indochina to establish congrégations,  organised on the basis of language and ethnicity and endowed with powers to  police, tax, assist, educate and repatriate members.145 Membership of the five large  Chinese congregations was heavily concentrated in Saigon and Cholon. When  French police did make efforts to challenge Chinese privilege and regulate vice, as  in Cholon in 1903 and 1912, community leaders’ protests ensured that such initi- atives were swiftly curtailed.146 Congregations successfully resisted the regulation  of domestic life, securing exemption from legislation registering servants in 1904  and scuppering plans for a regular immigration service in 1906.147
 British antislavery campaigners, in concert with Chinese Christians and other  reformers, exposed orientalist arguments and used universalist visions of child- hood to challenge colonial authority. Though the campaigners’ principal focus  was Hong Kong, the colonial government based in Singapore eventually moved  first to dismantle the orientalist defence and then embrace a wide-ranging com- mitment to protect the welfare of child colonial subjects. By contrast, in Saigon  and Hanoi, even after colonial government and League reports revealed direct  links between trafficking and prostitution, no similar official reevaluation of the  state’s commitment to Asian children followed. For here, evidence of ‘unfree’  children posed a more potent threat to a form of governance more closely asso- ciated with an ideology of humanitarian ethics, but also one facing anticolonial  movements rejecting the French nation as a source of benevolent enlightenment.
 From this vision of an unrealised past, segregated schools emerged as a solution  preempting a dystopic future. They would permit the realisation of an ideal of  childhood, while usefully concealing the failings of those whose performance of  it fell short.
 Leaders of the Church and missionary groups in Hong Kong found the in- troduction of flagrant racial legislation disquieting. The Anglican bishop, Joseph  Hoare, opposed the segregationist policy and resigned from the education com- mittee in protest before it even completed its work. That he should take this  view is unsurprising given religious workers’ adherence to universalist Christian  ideals presupposing the equality of children before God. Catholics opened many  schools in China but more often established orphanages, evidently influenced by  assumptions of sacramental grace; that baptism in infancy equated to salvation.  A romantic Catholic tradition of childhood elaborated in the aftermath of the  French Revolution sometimes figured baptised children as a pure spiritual force.  As D. E. Mungello has shown using the example of the promotional materials  of the Holy Childhood Association, such a view could efface racial divisions be- tween children rather than undergirding them. Evangelical Protestants of the  LMS and the low-church Anglican ‘Church Missionary Society’ did not always  accept Catholic claims of sacramental grace, and preferred to emphasise Bible  study as a route to salvation and belief in adulthood. However, as evangelical  opinion had hoved away from uncritical acceptance of the doctrine of original  sin, childhood also emerged as an ideal site for Protestant action, for the ‘rescue’  and reform of individuals, and their preparation for doing the work of God.63
 In these empire centres debates surrounding education raised children’s  awareness of age as a key category of experience and societal transformation. For  many young Chinese, events in Paris on 4 May 1919 lit the touch paper. The refus- al of the Allies to support Chinese claims for the restitution of Kiachow triggered  the May Fourth Movement. This spilled over into Singapore where Chinese stu- dents took to the streets on 19 June 1919. The government imposed martial law.  After this Chinese students conspicuously refused to celebrate the Allied victory  on 19–20 July 1919. In 1917 the introduction of guoyu (National Language) in  teaching at Chinese schools, such as the one funded by Tan Kah Kee and Lim Nee  Soon, revealed links between diasporic Chinese youth and the new republican  government of China. This raised fears that the Communist-influenced Kuo- mintang government in Canton held sway over the students. As revolutionaries  brought in antiforeign texts, schools became battlegrounds for the Kuomintang  and the Chinese Communist Party. The self-identification of children as ‘youth’  raised the possibility of links across a ‘generation’ incorporating workers and stu- dents of both sexes in an alliance of age.
 Moreover, lurking behind Brévié’s vision of a racially plural but culturally  French elite was the assumption that ‘pure’ French youth would quite “natural- ly” take the lead. In 1939 the official report on the “General Conclusions of the  Inquiry on the Child of Indochina” reiterated this quite explicitly by stipulating  that French youth had “a great role of initiative to play” in working up what was  described as a “kind of colonisation infantile.”130 This vision of leadership by youth  would be given much fuller expression after July 1940 under the pro-Vichy regime  of Governor General Jean Decoux.131
 The solution Haffner proposed to this problem lay in the very gardens under  his direction. In a detailed plan sent to the lieutenant governor of Cochinchina,  Augustin Fourès, he sought funding for what he called an ‘agricultural orphanage.’  Haffner proposed an experiment in which Eurasian youth would be schooled in  the Botanical Gardens to become a new cadre of farmers. ‘His’ orphans, taught  en paillote in a four-year course, would learn techniques that would enable them  to bring the fertile lands of the heights and plains into productive relation. This,  Haffner hoped, would solve the familiar problem of finding new crops suitable  for export (the only really successful export so far was rice, a fact which he blamed  on indigenous cultivators’ innate conservatism). The director felt sure young Eur- asians would become willing experimenters and a “leader class in agriculture.”  An additional benefit was that they would not suffer the same deleterious effects  as ‘full-blooded’ Europeans through exposure to the environment. As ‘hybrids’  themselves, Haffner also somehow imagined the orphans would be more ‘natural- ly’ predisposed to mastery of the techniques of greffe la selection and hybridisation.  And by lessening French reliance upon the Chinese and disseminating modern  techniques among the Vietnamese, he argued they would help to improve colonial  relations. Rounding off this unsettling combination of domestic and imperial  economics, Haffner argued that the harvests the orphans produced would ensure  that the whole project paid for itself after just a few years.9
 Because the society was voluntary and did not depend upon government fund- ing, it not only won official sponsorship but could also gesture toward quite radical  aims, such as ‘emancipating’ the métis into Frenchness, that is, full citizenship.13 A  speech by the president of the ‘active committee,’ Nicolaï, published in the journal  Mékong on 20 May 1894, identified the métis as the potential basis of colonial society  for “it is there, among the offspring of our elders that we will find the heart, the  soul of our new France, this new France that, today, we have the duty of raising in  our own image, kneaded from our own flesh and blood.”14 Even Lanessan praised  this philanthropic effort, “embodying the work of concord and fusion,” the assimi- lative genre of colonialism for which Saigon was well known.15 The local press also  celebrated the Saigon oeuvre for demonstrating that the French presence in Asia  was flexible and absorptive in contrast to a British equivalent that was aloof and  austere, a “foreign body in the organism . . . threatened from one day to the next  with expulsion.”16 Evidently, similar concerns were emerging in Hanoi around the  same time, for the head of the Post Office, a member of the Public Works Depart- ment and a pharmacist together created a society there in 1897 with related aims.17
 Liberal reflections upon mixed-race people as worthy beneficiaries of state  support in the colonies derived not only from an inclusive notion of British impe- rial subjecthood based upon blood, but of the Eurasian as a child. Colonial visions  of ‘rootless’ and ‘culturally lost’ children connected with dystopic metropolitan  ideas of childhood split along the lines of a racialised class difference. But by  the 1880s impressions of street children in the metropole had shifted away from  midcentury assumptions of irretrievable racial alterity. As a wave of Christian  voluntary institutions led a drive for social purity in the face of growing secular- isation, every child came to be seen as potentially salvageable, capable of being  rescued to ‘true childhood.’ Re-exported to empire, such contentions obviously  threatened the practical consideration of running colonies such as Hong Kong on  a shoestring (the Colonial Office expected Crown Colonies to be self-sufficient).  So in response to Smale’s intervention, Governor John Pope Hennessy summoned  expert opinion. On his behalf, the German missionary from the London Mis- sionary Society, Ernst J. Eitel, who was also inspector of schools, explained that  for decades Eurasians had taken full advantage of the educational infrastructure.  Many boys had studied English within the colony’s schools. He noted that the boys are invariably sent to the Government Central school where they generally distin- guish themselves, and as a rule these boys obtain good situations in Hongkong, in the  open ports and abroad. The girls crowd into the schools kept by Missionary Societies.
 Indeed, the sense of reciprocity between Europeans and Eurasians in Singapore  spilled over into paternal gestures within the emerging voluntary sphere. French  and Spanish Catholics engaged heavily in social work among this group. As part  of an Anglican-oriented response, C. B. Buckley’s philanthropic ‘Christmas Treat’  celebrated and succoured the Christian children of poorer Eurasian families, in  particular those attending the colony’s schools and those with links to St. An- drew’s Cathedral.47 Consequently, if there was a ‘Singapore childhood’ on display  in the Treat from the late 1860s onward, Eurasian children were in large part its  public embodiment—though this group was never explicitly separated out and  defined as such, but instead fit within an overarching, plural vision of childhood.
 However, while racial intermediacy appears to have been less heavily proscribed  in Singapore for longer, around the turn of the century a variety of state-imposed  reforms imperilled the privileges that Eurasians had carved out in colonial soci- ety. When young Eurasians attempted a patriotic gesture by forming a Volunteer  Corps in August 1897, C. P. Lucas at the Colonial Office revealed that the colonial  secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, “strongly expressed” the view that such a develop- ment was “undesirable.”48 In 1904, Governor Sir John Anderson formally barred  ‘non-Europeans’ from senior appointments in the Straits administration.49 In  1910 another ruling barred Asians and Eurasians from administrative posts in the civil service, forcing them into inferior grades (as mechanics, typists, clerks  and train drivers).
 Whilst in Hong Kong exclusionary practices had prompted the odd letter  to the editor, in Singapore completely new journals or newspapers emerged to  serve as mouthpieces through which Eurasians could respond to this provoca- tion. Though these were often short lived, as in the case of the Singapore Eurasian  Advocate (1888–91), they sought to define and promote a discrete community and  its demands. After 1904 Eurasian interest groups also began to cohere around  public meetings held to protest the colour bar. One produced a petition that was  despatched to the British Parliament.50 Churches also provided an institutional  focus around which such energies found expression. Wealthy, elite Eurasians (of  the so-called double ten) had established early links with philanthropic culture as  patrons, but also noteworthy in this climate was the emergence of a new ‘genera- tion’ of Eurasian youth making more assertive demands in defence of what they  defined as their ‘community’s’ interests.
 Caught in the midst of this bitter debate, métis protection societies had given up  radical assimilationist positions but now sought to emphasise the importance of  their work by recasting Eurasians as vulnerable children.
 In the crisis, the paradigm of ‘maturity’ proved valuable both in interpreting  policy to London and in developing new bases for collaborative relations with  the Chinese elite. John Carroll has argued that a long-standing, carefully culti- vated and profound social distance separated Hong Kong’s British and Chinese  elites.94 However, from 1911, as we have seen, spectacular celebrations of childhood  bridged this social divide. During the war these efforts proceeded in new formats,  such as bazaars. In peacetime, Governor Stubbs’s wife, who was president of the  Ministering Children’s League, refashioned it into an umbrella organisation en- compassing much other philanthropic work. Because of this, child-centric vol- untary work exemplified and distinguished a ‘mature’ civility, and the language  of age emerged as one that Eurasians could draw upon to articulate a sense of  shared Anglo-Chinese interests in times of unrest.
 As the Great Depression hit Hong Kong from 1929 and competition for clerical  positions intensified, younger Eurasians became more keenly aware of the lack  of any ‘community’ leadership capable of defending their interests. This was per- haps unsurprising given that so many of the wealthy Eurasian elite had aligned  themselves with Chineseness. The problems of the younger generation were quite  different. And some now felt the need to create new institutions capable of pro- tecting their distinctive needs and concerns. An important example was the phil- anthropic ‘Welfare League’ (or Tongren hui), which held its first general meeting  in July 1930. Though Sir Robert Ho Tung served as president, the real energy was  supplied by younger members such as the thirty-seven-year-old solicitor Lo Man  Kam and Charles Graham (Carl) Anderson, the league’s secretary, who was in his  early forties.103 In a speech announcing this initiative, Anderson, who had been  born in Hong Kong to Eurasian parents, defended the notion of a Eurasian ‘com- munity.’ He located its essence not in terms of race or civilisation but maturity,  good citizenship and a fusion of blood. As he put it: We feel we are a community. . . . It has been said of us that we can have no unity, and  since even the semi-civilised tribes of Africa have it, this, though palpably absurd, is a  challenge to be faced and an insult to be wiped out. . . . With the blood of Old China  mixed with that of Europe in us, we show the world that this fusion, to put it no higher,  is not detrimental to good citizenship.104
 In this appeal Anderson located maturity in blood that was figuratively ‘old.’ Ul- timately, it was the Anglo-Chinese phenotype that distinguished Eurasians from  others still arriving on the civilisational stage. However, Anderson located Eur- asians’ ‘maturity’ in the blood of ‘Old China’ rather than Europe. Even younger  Eurasians, then, seemed to hark back to an older China, one where cultural Con- fucianism afforded their fathers’ generation a less exposed position within the  overarching framework of ‘Chineseness.’ This was a rather nostalgic response, but one that is unsurprising given that it was forged in the face of conditions  of depression that were eroding privilege and hastening societal fragmentation  defined along more intensely nationalist lines.
 Because Singapore society was more obviously plural than that of Hong Kong,  in the early twentieth century official policy focused upon reinforcing divisions  between constituent groups in order to prevent unrest. Fitting all of those resi- dent within racial categories required remarkable contortions and elisions, as Joel  Kahn has shown.106 But as the colonial state undercut Eurasians’ privileges the  latter proved adept at combining strategically with other Anglophone groups to  ‘express the views of domiciled communities.’ The Malay Tribune, for example,  a newspaper started in 1914 with support from Lim Boon Keng and Eurasian  benefactors, appealed to the English-speaking of all races and provided a vehicle  for such views.107

 Ballantyne argues that the development of Aryanism as a racial ideology on the New Zealand frontier in the nineteenth century was the product of a multiplicity of transnational connections between colonial South Asia and the Pacific. Several constellations of imperial networks were par- ticularly crucial, including an emergent imperial newspaper and print culture that connected the colony to the wider world of empire, and the establishment of learned institutions, such as Theosophy and the Poly- nesian Society, which had strong and direct connections to India. But perhaps most important were well-developed migration networks that linked India and New Zealand, including a large cluster of colonial sur- veyors and foresters, who began their careers in the service of the East India Company (and later, the Government of India) before transferring to New Zealand. ‘Thus’, writes Ballantyne, ‘two elite cliques of experi- enced India hands played a pivotal role in state-sponsored colonial science and were at the forefront of the colonial project to map and demarcate land and to police its effective use’.52
 The goal of improvement and its linkage with science formed, then, a part of the mentality of the British elite in the formative period of its empire. Turning such goals into a programmatic strategy for the advance- ment of knowledge within the imperial setting required, however, a com- mitment on the part of the British state which was slow to be realized. Francis Bacon had tried in vain to interest James I in his plans for the reform of learning and many of his successors and their administrations were equally slow in embracing the view that the state should serve as a patron of scientific progress. British government had long been based on the view that the state should limit its functions as much as possible, leaving much of the day to day administration to be carried on at the local level through the voluntary service of a landowning class which accepted the need to act as Justices of the Peace and other such func- tionaries as a just return for their social position. In science, too, vol- untary service was seen as the natural way to proceed – a message underlined by the fact that at its foundation the Royal Society in 1660 received no more than a royal title and a mace from Charles II.
 Elsewhere in the British Empire, too, science formed an important part of the elite culture and its cultivation was both a mark of gentility and an espousal of the goals of improvement which formed an important part of the justification of empire.51 The growth of local scientific societies was one index of the increasing local consolidation of colonial elites. Such local scientific bodies provided an opportunity for rational amuse- ment, social and political networking and, it was hoped, the promotion of the goals of improvement. Accordingly, particular emphasis was placed on the study of possible sources of improved economic well-being – one of the major goals espoused by Jones in his presidential address on the importance of Indian science. When, for example, the Van Diemen’s Land Scientific Society was founded in 1829, it was ‘constituted … in  imitation of the Royal & other literary & scientific societies of Europe & India’, and it took as one of its major goals the ‘eliciting and discovering the properties and uses to which the vegetable productions of the island may be applied and to ascertain the improvements which may be adopted in their cultivation’.52 Its successor body, the grandly named, The Royal Society of Van Diemen’s Land for Botany, Horticulture and the Advance- ment of Body (founded in 1843 as the first Royal Society outside Britain) urged its members to promote ‘the advance of Science and the progress of the Colony’.53
 This is not to argue that ‘science’, or ‘scientists’ did not exist in Aus- tralia before the wave of exhibitions starting in the 1860s and reaching their apex two decades later by the time of the Melbourne Centennial International in 1888. That earlier history provided a foundation for science and scientists at the exhibitions, including an existing public pres- ence and at least some public authority. As noted above, scientific dis- plays alone were popular at the first two metropolitan exhibitions held in Sydney and Melbourne in 1854, primarily as a way to collect Australian exhibits for the Paris Universal Exposition one year later. Such exhibits and the participation of colonial scientists drew upon general scientific interest in the colonies. The practice of science itself was part of settle- ment from the very first British generations in the forms of mapping, mineralogy, botanical gardens, natural history, and other practical exer- cises.42 Scientific enterprise of this kind benefited from the pattern of colonial state intervention in public affairs, a precedent established dur- ing the early years of official colonization in New South Wales and Vic- toria, and consented to by even the most ‘conservative’ pastoralists and politicians.43 Scientific societies pursuing ambitious projects inevitably developed a close relationship with local, or colonial governments, such as those in the city of Melbourne and the colony of Victoria. Since many Australian politicians were active in these philosophical and scientific societies and Colonial Governors served as patrons, it is not surprising that requests for official assistance were often fulfilled, if offers them- selves were not forthcoming.44
 The institutional foundations and networks were clearly present in the young colonies of the Australian continent. Key scientists were active in public institutions, voluntary societies, perhaps even commercial life, their various positions and roles often connected and mutually reinforc- ing. Officers and staff of the major scientific collections were also major players at the exhibitions. In this way, colonial public life mirrored to a great degree English developments. John Stuart Mill noted in 1836 that England ‘is covered with associations’, or ‘societies’, including those  for political, religious, philanthropic, and scientific purposes.45 Notable among such societies were the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the provincial Mechanics’ Institutes. By mid-century, similar associations were found throughout at least eastern Australia, where  agricultural societies and mechanics’ institutes provided the Antipodean reflection of the metropole’s mid Victorian institutional image. As was the case with their British brethren, such associations in Australia offered lectures, journals, museums, libraries, and art and industrial expositions, creating the sinews of nineteenth-century local, civic, colonial and inter- colonial, or national culture, both artistic and scientific.46
 Scientists were anxious about their place in colonial society, seized by a sense of impermanence and disregard, or homelessness in all of its mean- ings. Reverend W.B. Clarke addressed such concerns in his ‘Anniversary Address’ to the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1875 amid the flurry of exhibitions in the Australian colonies, Britain, and Europe.63 Clarke was perhaps the most well-known and active geologist in the colony,  if not throughout Australasia, and his public scientific life included organ- izing exhibits, writing essays, and serving as commissioner for Australian exhibitions starting with the first Sydney Metropolitan show in 1854.
 To those ends, significant and enduring connections with other learned societies in New South Wales, across the borders in the other Australian colonies, and abroad should be pursued. The Royal Society needed to be part of the various networks potentially connecting it and its members to a wider world, both at home in its own colony and beyond the colony’s borders. Science and its public face, the Royal Society, might then become a permanent and well-funded institution, recognized as part of colonial society and generator, recipient, and representative of wider civic and national, if not imperial, interests. Science was seen as a vital connection creating and a vital metaphor representing the nation and society. It pro- vided not only a language comprehensible at home and abroad, but also the social, cultural, and intellectual authority necessary to justify public policies. Might not society and the nation work the way that science and scientists did?

 Postwar British imperialism, therefore, derived considerable practical and symbolic benefit from contact with the FAO. The Organization’s international mandate did not constitute a challenge to imperial gov- ernance per se. Indeed, the FAO accommodated the status quo of  international geopolitics through attributing to imperial powers the responsibility for colonial development. Yet despite these assurances, the FAO’s ties with colonial territories heightened governmental concerns over the sustainability of staffing late colonial administrations.
 The socio-cognitive networks of CFS members, therefore, unsettled the hierarchical channels of communication between the FAO and colonial administrations insisted upon by the Colonial Office. Neither colonial governments nor the Colonial Office itself could prevent CFS personnel from utilizing networks as a means of facilitating their trans- fer to an international civil service, despite guidelines and financial penalties for breaking contracts. The final section of this chapter draws together the various mechanisms underpinning the transfer of CFS per- sonnel to FAO employment discussed above. It offers a microlevel per- spective on the reconfiguration of career networks through the insights of practitioners involved, focusing on the two most formative modes of contact between the FAO and CFS personnel, namely FAO technical assistance projects and forestry conferences.
 Conclusion: legacy The socio-cognitive networks forged through interaction between  CFS members and FAO staff in the late colonial period jarred with the Colonial Office’s desire to delimit the flow of networks of personal connection that traversed imperial space. FAO assistance to British crown colonies simultaneously helped strengthen the ‘Second Colonial Occu- pation’ and generated fears of its demise. In an era of progressive decolon- ization, global shortages of natural resource specialists resulted in the career trajectories of colonial scientists becoming highly politicized. Yet while colonial bureaucrats railed against the FAO for the potentially cor- rosive impact of their recruitment networks on the staffing of colonial administrations, the lived experiences of rank and file practitioners who personally negotiated the material realities of late imperialism elicit the extent to which serving officers initiated extra-imperial communications. The flow of colonial foresters into FAO employment would only increase with constitutional change. Yet – with Whitehall accusations of the  FAO ‘poaching’ serving personnel resurfacing in the UK’s bilateral aid program – the end of formal empire was by no means the end of the inter-institutional frictions generated by recruitment. Continued short- ages in the availability of natural resource specialists did nothing to alle- viate these tensions.78 Where once, FAO recruitment practice had played upon Colonial Office anxieties of imperial decline, it continued to serve well into the late 1960s as an index of Britain’s waning international political influence.
 The intensification of cultural contact in the Pacific from the 1760s modified this pattern. In the central Pacific, Europeans established sus- tained relationships with a range of Polynesian societies that had developed hierarchical forms of political organization, consolidated important divisions of labour and elaborated complex sequences of ritual performances. These communities could not easily be dismissed as mere ‘savages’ lacking religion, rather the structured nature of their polities and their strong interest in trade suggested that they possessed a significant degree of cultural sophistication. Most importantly, it seemed that they were religious and in an Enlightenment Europe where orthodox theologians, deists and anti-Church philosophes were concerned with religious diversity, the ‘natural’ religions of the Pacific were of special interest.
 But in terms of social function, the two systems were similar in that they preserved the powers of the elite groups (or racial groups in India) in society, by establishing a code of ‘no-touchism’ that protected the sanctity and power of the elites from the defiling touch of the ordinary person. In both societies, these conventions, backed by the sanction  of religious authority, provided the key socio-religious structure that governed everyday life.99
 The intensely sectarian programmes of the missionaries undoubt- edly deepened these tensions. Both Wesleyan and Anglican missionar- ies drew on pre-existing Maori resentment of the French to launch anti-Catholic campaigns which were heavily reliant on print.66 In response to the establishment of the Catholic mission the CMS pro- duced Te Anakaraiti (‘The Anti-Christ’), a pamphlet labelling the Pope the Anti-Christ. This was quickly followed by two more anti-Catholic pamphlets, in the form of dialogues between Rapu Pono (Searcher for Truth) and Aroha Pono (True Love), which detailed twelve ‘errors’ of the Catholic Church.67 As a result of this anti-Catholic propaganda, Maori routinely called Jean-Baptiste Pompallier, the Catholic Bishop, the ‘Anti-Christ’.68 Pompallier reflected that the Catholic missionaries armed with ‘only our voices and our pens’ struggled as ‘heresy [i.e. the Protestant missions] had two printing presses at its command’, which allowed both the Anglicans and the Wesleyans to circulate ‘pam- phlets, tracts, and little books, which while teaching the first truths of salvation, were filled with all sorts of objections and calumnies against  the minister and the faith of the Catholic Church.’69 When W. B. Ullathorne, the English Catholic Vicar-General of Australia, visited New Zealand in 1840 to dispel the Maori belief that only the French were Catholics, he discovered that the Protestant missionaries had not only told Maori ‘fantastic stories of the old anti-Catholic type’, but that these anti-Catholic tales had been further sensationalized ‘for  the New Zealand palate’.70 But Maori were not passive pawns in a European sectarian battle fought on New Zealand soil, as they exploited these sectarian tensions by playing on Protestant fears of ‘Popery’ to demand more frequent visits from missionaries and easier access to baptism.71

 C. Abolitionists continued to argue against slavery itself. The Anti-Slavery Society, founded in 1823, intensified its  parliamentary agitation under the leadership of Thomas Fowell Buxton.
 C. Industrialization gave new prominence to religious nonconformists and to advocates of the new evangelicalism.  Their influence led to the abolition of slavery and the dispatch of missionaries to overseas colonies.
 H. The Protestant Church of Ireland was a standing grievance to the Catholic people, who had to pay for its upkeep.  1. The Catholic Association, founded by Daniel O’Connell in 1823, campaigned for Catholic emancipation.  2. Catholic Emancipation in 1829 gave Catholic property owners the right to become members of Parliament.  3. Not until 1869 was the Church of Ireland disestablished.

 From the perspective of many groups, empires such as those ruled by the  Ottomans, Habsburgs (Austria), and Britain, could be more benign than the  ethnically based nation-states that succeeded them. Not all empires were benign  to minority ethnic groups, but many were. The British concept of imperial  civilisation included religious tolerance (up to a point) and ethnic diversity. In  addition, Britain eventually sought to end formal enslavement in its empire (and  elsewhere), although the labour situation continued to be grossly inegalitarian  on an ethnic basis in the colonies, and even more so than in the metropole.
 At the same time, there was in England a degree of public, national  engagement with territorial expansion. The development of a public politics in  England ensured that policymaking was not simply a case of the Crown but,  instead, from the early thirteenth century, involved the ‘community of the  realm’, an entity that was to be represented in parliament. As a result, what would  later be termed the public sphere played a role in the discussion of policy, both  directly and, via the impact on the raising of resources, notably troops and taxes,  indirectly. A similar process occurred in Ireland, where the conflicts played out  in the Dublin parliament, England’s first colonial legislature, helped crystallise  a distinctive colonial identity.7 However, the extent to which English public  opinion supported the longlasting intervention in France, which became more  insistent once the Hundred Years’ War had broken out in the 1330s, is unclear.
