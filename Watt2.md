  James Keir reflected that ‘his successes and his failures were all on a grand scale’, and he certainly strove to ensure the engine was successful, engaging in detail with how it would be made.	james	engine
  In an early letter he explained to Watt how, by having an engine manufactory filled with ‘excellent work- men’, with ‘more excellent tools than would be worth any man’s while to procure for one single engine’, he could build engines 20 per cent cheaper, and with ‘as great a difference of accuracy as there is between the blacksmith and the mathematical instrument maker’.	watt	cheaper
  This was a direct appeal to Watt’s practical abilities and sensibilities about the engine.	watt	engine
  But in another, later, letter Boulton went further, explaining, ‘We are systematising the business of engine making as we have done before in the button manufac - tory.	boulton	button
 .’24 As Watt had his leap of the imagination in devising the separate condenser, here was Boulton’s equivalent: to precisely make engines en masse, just like making buttons.	watt	button
  So how actually were buttons made.	button	
  And how did the firm of Boulton & Watt build engines.	watt	engines
  The manufacture of buttons was, like many of Birmingham’s other products, driven by the demands of fashion.	birmingham	button
  From reaching the height of their popularity in the 1780s, the vagaries of taste meant that, by 1791, 20,000 people working in the buckle trade were petitioning the Prince of Wales claiming distress.	birmingham	
  In support of their claims, the Birmingham Gazette in May 1790 contrasted the ‘Manly buckle’ and ‘that most ridiculous of all ridiculous fashions, the effeminate shoestring’.	birmingham	
  Buttons matched buckles in fashionable circles; one cartoon of 1777 shows a young gentleman effecting a ‘coup de bouton’ on a well-dressed young lady who shields her eyes from the dazzling light reflected off his cut-steel buttons.	button	
  Another has a stylish young man proclaiming ‘I am the thing!.		
 ’, with a mass of steel buttons effacing his coat, and one even incongruously taped to the top of his hat.	button	
  To satiate the heavy demand for buttons, their manufacture very quickly developed into a carefully organized and efficient process, which became one of the highlights of Soho.	button	
  Abraham Rees wrote that there was ‘no manufacture which includes such an infinite variety of operations as that of the button-maker’; it employed ‘a little Army of all ages’, and the scene of them hard at work was, for Jabez Maud Fisher, ‘too great for Description.	button	
  Tis wonderful, astonishing, amazing.		
 .’30 In 1770 buttons were being made in a range of materials, from silver and glass to horn, ivory and pearl.	button	
  But out of these the most popular was steel – so popular, in fact, that often cheaper glass was polished up to imitate it.	cheaper	
  Boulton ordered steel from Benjamin Huntsman in Sheffield but also carefully recy- cled ‘cuttings and scraps’, melting them down into cast steel for new uses.	boulton	
  There was also a trade in old sword blades and even horseshoe nails, which would be used for the tiny studs in steel buttons.	button	
  Turning this steel into the finished product took a whole range of techniques, which were perfect candidates for the application of simple machine tools like presses, stamps and lathes.	lathe	machine
  An Italian traveller wrote in 1787 how these helped workers in ‘binding, twist- ing, shaping, pointing, cutting, marking, and turning the metals with wonderful quickness’.		
  First, a ‘blank’ for each button was james watt 116 ‘Button Maker’, from The Book of Trades (1824).	watt	button
  He is working a drop-stamp and is about to raise the upper die ready for striking.		
  cut out of a sheet of metal using the fly-press.		
  The press was ‘composed of a smooth cylindrical punch of steel, which is pressed by the screw into a hole, corresponding in size to the stamp.		
  In this way a small circular disc is pressed out.		
 .’34 Press workers were in almost perpetual motion, swinging the flys (the large, weighted levers that gave the press its working impetus) from 14,000 to 20,000 strokes a day.		
  Usually the blanks were formed as shallow cups, with ‘cramps’ around the outside which could be turned over with the use of pliers to hold other, decorative material in position.		
  Next, a drop stamp was used to apply decorative shapes or patterns to the button.	button	
  The stamps had two dies: a lower one, which was con cave and engraved with the pattern, and the upper, which was convex and attached to a large iron weight.	iron	stamps
  The upper die was hoisted up by a rope and block between two vertical posts.		
  When it dropped, guided by the posts, it formed the blank into the desired shape.		
  Metals could be inlaid into each other using stamps, which was a particular Soho specialism.	stamps	
  Alternatively, tiny individual pieces of polished steel could be set into a blank by hand.		
  This required a steady hand and a good eye, often making it a child’s job.		
  Then an edging lathe would smooth the circumference of each button, removing the rough surplus material or ‘burr’ left around the edge.	lathe	button
  Sometimes a special engine-turning lathe could be used to produce elaborate geometric patterns on the front of buttons, the lathe mechanism turning in a way reminiscent of a modern child’s spirograph.	lathe	button
  With the button’s shape and decoration finished, it would need mounting on a ‘shank’, a shallow hook, so it could be fixed to clothing.	lathe	button
  Even in the 1820s Abraham Rees was describing a shank making machine as ‘a very curious engine’, suggesting the technical wizardry that went into making even this simple component.	engine	machine
  But all the equipment of button making was capable of high precision: drop stamps had a catch which secured the upper die after it had fallen, to avoid it bouncing and damaging the button, and the lower die was accurately positioned by four screw adjusters.	button	stamps
  And engine-turning lathes, already being used by Josiah Wedgwood to create complex designs on ceramics at Etruria, would be refined to produce the un - forge able geometric patterns on banknotes.	lathe	forge
  Wedgwood employed a james watt 118 mathematical instrument maker to construct and maintain equipment in his Etruria factory, but the job of making the lathes fell to an ‘ingenious & indefatigable smith’.	watt	instrument
  That an instrument maker could make an industrial machine, and a blacksmith a high-precision one, is testament to the practical skills held within these respective trades.	trades	machine
  Choreographing all these techniques required careful organ- ization, and each worker came to be an expert in a single, tiny part of the overall process.		
  A commentator remarked how, in preparing the button blanks, ‘A small boy makes the blanks red-hot in a small furnace.	button	
  Another boy puts them under the punch, one by one.	instrument	machine
  The third picks them out of the punch and greases the upper mould between each punching with a greased brush.	mould	machine
 .’38 A visitor to Soho admired how this approach made the faculties of those involved ‘more expeditious and more to be depended on than when obliged or suffered to pass from one to another’.		
  The same visitor recorded how each button ‘passes through fifty hands, and each hand perhaps passes a thousand in a day; likewise, this work becomes so simple that, five times in six, children of six to eight years old do it as well as men’.	button	
  Some button makers estimated that this way of working was twenty times faster than when each individual item was made by a single worker.	makers	button
  The button making workforce consisted of men, women and children.	button	
  Women tended towards specific parts of the process, particularly polishing the finished steel buttons with ‘the combined oxides of a mixture of lead and tin . . . mixed with water or proof 119 gentlemen of merit and ingenuity, 1765–81 spirit’ until a fine black shine was produced.	button	
  Patent agent Thomas Gill went so far as to note that ‘no effectual substitute for the soft skin which is only to be found upon the delicate hands of women, has hitherto been met with.		
 .’43 How long their hands remained delicate while being immersed in metal oxides and alcoholic proof spirit is questionable.		
  Children worked largely in the unskilled side of the button trade; they included among their number the ‘nut crackers’, ‘little lads who are engaged in breaking the outer shells off the vegetable ivory nuts [the seeds of palm trees] ready for the workman who saws them up.	button	
  Every little rascal who is too wild for steady work can be set to do this, their destructive propensities being happily utilised in the manner described.		
 .’44 Button making contributed, then, to the industrious atmosphere of Soho that so exhilarated visitors.	button	
  ‘The front of this house’, wrote Jabez Maud Fisher, is like a stately palace of some Duke.		
  Within it is divided into hundreds of little apartments, all which like Bee hives are crowded with the Sons of Industry.		
  The whole Scene is a Theatre of Business, all conducted like one piece of Mechanism, Men, Women and Children full of employment according to their Strength and Docility.		
  The very Air buzzes with a Variety of Noises.		
  All seems like one vast Machine.	machine	
  We can almost hear the heave and thud of the drop stamps, the tinkle of the button blanks falling from the presses, the whirring treadles of lathes and the thunder of feet as children raced boxes of materials from one workshop to the next.	lathe	stamps
  This is how Boulton systematized the button manufactory.	boulton	button
  From 1774 the challenge for Boulton & Watt was applying these concepts to the business of making steam engines.	watt	engines
  The basics of engine manufacturing were well established.	engine	
  To build a Newcomen engine, the customer would contract with an engineer to erect the engine, and with different metal foundries and other suppliers to provide the components and materials needed.	engine	engineer
  The cylinder and pumps would usually be delivered ready for use, and some of the smaller iron parts would be ordered from local suppliers james watt 120 for ease of delivery, but everything else had to be manufactured on site, for which purpose the engineer assembled a team of smiths and plumbers, masons and carpenters.	watt	engineer
  This was broadly the path Boulton & Watt followed, albeit with some significant differences.	watt	boulton
  They were careful to specify particular suppliers of each part to ensure their high standards were met.	watt	boulton
  John Wilkinson of Bersham, Shropshire, became their favoured supplier of engine cylinders and pistons, pumps and condensers.	watt	cylinder
  Izon’s foundry in West Bromwich, Wilkinson’s other works at Bradley, near Birmingham, and the city’s Eagle Foundry manufactured many of the smaller metal components, and piston rods were made by Jukes Coulson of Rotherhithe, who had a well-established reputation for making ship’s anchors.	birmingham	wilkinson
  Importantly, then, beyond the very specialized parts like the ‘nozzles’, which controlled the flow of steam in and out of the cylinder, Boulton & Watt did relatively little of the physical work of engine-building themselves.	watt	cylinder
  This was a canny move: the partners realized that manufacturing Watt’s improved engine and exploiting it commercially were not necessarily the same thing.	watt	engine
  The former, with the possibility of tech- nical difficulties in getting the engine to operate as required, and needing engineering facilities, foundries and workshops, would require huge investment and carry heavy risks.	engine	engineer
  The latter, obtaining revenues from the engine’s users, was where the potential profits were.	engine	users
  So Boulton & Watt, rather than building engines from scratch themselves, designed them, carried out the necessary calculations, produced working drawings and provided an ‘engine erector’ from a pool of appropriately skilled men to oversee the day-to-day execution of each engine’s construction.	watt	engines
  But the bulk of the work of physically creating the parts for each engine was given to others.	engine	
  What, then, of assembling engines like buttons.	engine	button
  This was a powerful piece of rhetoric, suggesting Boulton’s formidable persua - sive abilities and shining a light on the close interconnections between machine making and a wider world of manufacture and consump- tion.	boulton	machine
  But things would not work out that way in reality; no one had built engines on the scale Boulton & Watt wanted to before, and they needed to establish working practices that minimized the risks involved.	watt	engines
  As Boulton had bided his time to form his partnership 121 gentlemen of merit and ingenuity, 1765–81 with Watt, now he played a long game to ensure the success of the engine business.	watt	partnership
  ‘Making engines like buttons’ was a statement of intent, perhaps intended to overawe his competitors.	boulton	button
  But the process of getting there was complex.		
  This complexity dogged Boulton & Watt from the start because of the location of most of their likely customers.	watt	boulton
  They were not in the more easily reached new manufacturing towns or on coalfields, because these generally had sufficient supplies of water power, or enough cheap coal to run inefficient but adequate atmospheric engines.	watt	engines
  A key market for the pumping engine was to be Cornwall, where metal mines extracting valuable tin or copper ores needed more power as they dug deeper underground, but were reliant on coal supplies shipped at considerable expense from South Wales.	watt	engine
  Both these factors meant the Cornish miners sought the most efficient engine available; they needed to replace 75 atmospheric engines, which were struggling to cope with pumping huge volumes of floodwater just as their owners’ finances were stretched by their prodigious coal consumption.	engine	engines
  Boulton & Watt offered an ideal solution to the difficulties faced.	watt	boulton
  While we have considered the actions of steam and heat inside the engine, we have not yet explored the engine as a physical artefact that had to safely and efficiently exploit those properties, the construc - tion of which was the major challenge that now confronted Boulton & Watt.	watt	engine
  The engines they made were big ‘house-built’ machines, working inside a building that provided support to the major com- ponents, and mainly used to pump water for canals, mines and water supply.	watt	machine
  The heart of the engine was its cylinder, which was mounted vertically on a strong foundation and measured 4 feet or more in diameter.	engine	cylinder
  Within was the piston, a large disc which filled as closely as possible the cylinder bore.	cylinder	
  The piston was attached to a piston rod that passed through the top of the cylinder via a ‘stuffing box’, which kept the steam inside while allowing the rod to go up and down.	steam	cylinder
  Steam was only injected into the cylinder on top of the piston, driving it downwards on its working stroke and making it a ‘single- acting’ engine.	steam	cylinder
  The piston rod was attached to a beam, which usually pivoted on top of one of the engine house walls, and the outer end, protruding outdoors, was connected to the pump rods that might james watt 122 extend hundreds of feet underground to drive pumps that moved water wherever it was needed.	watt	beam
  Inside the engine house a plug rod hung from the beam: this moved synchronously up and down with the piston, and pegs on it hit levers that opened and shut the engine’s ‘nozzles’.	engine	beam
  Engines on this scale, in the form of Newcomen’s atmos- pheric engine, had been built since about 1710.	engine	engines
  Now Boulton, Watt and their workforce faced the demands of making a similar-sized machine requiring the precision of instrument making.	watt	machine
  123 gentlemen of merit and ingenuity, 1765–81 Watt’s single-acting pumping engine for draining mines, 1788, as drawn in John Farey’s Treatise on the Steam Engine (1827).	watt	engine
  Much of each engine was made of timber.	engine	
  The engine beams were huge logs of oak or deal, several feet square, more than 15 feet long, and reinforced with braces and iron straps to withstand the strains placed upon them.	engine	beam
  Inside each engine house the engine’s moving parts were supported by a robust wooden frame.	engine	
  Engine builders worried constantly about the supply of large pieces of timber, particularly as the needs of the Royal Navy became increasingly press- ing during the wars of the last quarter of the eighteenth century, and its cost rose.	engine	
  And the relative ease of working timber, following long-established techniques, had to be balanced against the difficul- ties of using it in a machine, like Watt’s engine, that required high precision.	watt	machine
  Daniel Treadwell wrote how ‘A machine constituted of wood, subject to constant swelling and shrinking, and warping with every change of the atmosphere, is always liable to derangement.	machine	
  Indeed it can be said to be hardly capable of preserving its identity.	machine	
 !’48 So, there was some impetus to use different or new materials.		
  Watt’s Kinneil engine had a cylinder made of block-tin, solid tin blocks heated to melting point and then poured into a mould to form the correct shape upon cooling.	watt	cylinder
  Tin wasn’t strong enough to withstand the vacuum within and the cylinder collapsed, to be replaced by one cast in iron.	cylinder	iron
  And it was iron that became the engineer’s main material.	engine	engineer
  Giant blast furnaces in South Wales or Shropshire produced cast iron ‘pigs’, rough iron ingots named after the moulds the molten metal was poured into from the furnace, resembling a sow with piglets suckling at her side.	mould	iron
  The pigs were transported to Soho and other engineering centres and melted again to be turned into finished products.	engine	engineer
  Alongside cast iron came wrought iron, supplied in bars that had been heated in a specially designed ‘puddling’ furnace to remove the carbon and any impurities, then shaped by massive hammers and squeezed between rotating pairs of rollers until it was very fibrous in composition, which quality helped give it great strength.	rollers	iron
  Iron was durable, strong and capable of being precisely finished.	iron	
  Building steam engines required new parts to be made from iron in two ways: by casting and by forging.	steam	iron
  And the means of carrying out these processes ‘were rude, and the machinery imperfect . . . Nearly all depended on the individual workman’s skill.	machine	
 .’50 Those skills were in employing a range of hand techniques.		
  james watt 124 Take casting iron, for instance.	watt	iron
  First, a wooden model or ‘pattern’ of the required component had to be made.		
  The pattern maker’s tools were similar to those used in fine joinery or cabinetmaking, and he worked in deal, pine or mahogany, carefully dried so that it would not warp, screwing the pieces of wood together so they could be easily altered if need be and using a plane for fine adjustments.	watt	tools
  The pattern maker had to understand the entire casting process: he had to avoid sharp internal corners, which could lead to cracks in the cooling metal, and surfaces were always tapered, not quite parallel or square; if they were, there was a worse chance that they would stick in the sand mould, damaging its surfaces.	mould	
  Some allow - ance also had to be made for the metal contracting as it cooled, and the thickness of the metal was kept as constant as possible, so it cooled evenly.		
  The patterns would be placed in huge beds of sand, which was packed around them so that, when they were lifted out, a perfect negative copy was left behind for molten metal to be poured into.		
  The tools for this were simple trowels and shovels, and mauls to ram the sand in closely to the pattern.	tools	
  But the composition of the sand was critical, and depended on the moulder’s skill: it needed to be damp, or ‘green’, to form a good impression, but this carried the risk of an explosion if the molten metal contacted too much moisture, or, if gases could not escape, a ‘blown’ casting with areas of spongy, porous metal that would be much weaker than the sur- rounding material.	mould	
  And prior to the molten metal being poured, the details of the mould would be carefully prepared with tools: copper spoons for removing sand, trowels to smooth surfaces and round-ended tools to make sharp corners smooth.	mould	tools
  ‘Runners’, the channels in the mould to convey the molten metal as quickly as possible to where it was needed before it began to cool and lose its liquidity, were also carefully laid out.	mould	
  Finally, with the metal poured and cooled down over a period of days, the casting would be taken from its mould, cleaned up and prepared for further work.	mould	
  Alongside casting, forging the iron to shape was an important part of steam engine construction.	steam	iron
  Wrought or ‘malleable’ iron was supplied to the Soho Engine Manufactory by Isaac Spooner of Birmingham, and Watt also specified use of ‘the best tough scrap 125 gentlemen of merit and ingenuity, 1765–81 ‘The Iron Founder’, from The Book of Trades (1824).	watt	iron
  He is pouring molten iron from a ladle into a box mould for making small castings.	birmingham	iron
  iron from Wednesbury’ or ‘the best gun barrel iron’.	iron	
  Often the fibres of this high-quality metal were treated the same way as the filaments of spun cotton, and twisted as they were worked to avoid the outer surface becoming marred by dirty, longitudinal seams or ‘spills’, which could spoil inferior ironwork.	iron	cotton
  Forging these bars to the required shapes needed the use of a smith’s furnace to raise them to the right temperature, from a black-red just visible in daylight, to a bright red at which most work was performed, and white-hot and burning with vivid sparks for welding pieces of iron together.	forging	iron
  From the furnace the pieces of iron were hastily trans- ferred to the blacksmith’s anvil and there, with tongs, hammer and a range of other tools, they would be worked to the required shape: ‘drawing down’ reduced the thickness and increased the length of a piece of iron; ‘upsetting’ it made it thicker and shorter; and ‘building up’ saw pieces welded together.	iron	tools
  These three main processes were central to the manufacture of many parts of the engine, and would have comprised much of the work carried out at Soho.	engine	
  The centrepiece of the Engine Manufactory was a blacksmith’s shop with two great hearths for heating the iron, and at least one lathe – probably a great lathe with a hand capstan to drive it, given the size of some of the components that might be turned there: the largest of these might be the piston rod that attached the engine piston to the beam.	manufactory	beam
  This was made by taking a bundle of smaller rods, the central one round in section, the outer ones comprising angular ‘mitre iron’, all heated until they began to emit sparks, and then welding them into a single mass under the blows of a team of men wielding sledgehammers under the guidance of the foreman, indicating where he wanted the hammer strokes to fall with a long wooden wand.	wielding	iron
  At the other end of the scale of forge-work came the making of smaller items like nuts and bolts, demonstrating the versatility of the smith engaged in engine manufacture.	engine	versatility
  With foundry and forge work highly dependent on the hand skills of the foundryman, pattern maker or smith, the only part of the engine that required a dedicated, highly accurate machine tool was the cylinder.	foundry	machine
  This reflects that much of Watt’s frustration with the engine arose from being unable to make a piston and cylinder 127 gentlemen of merit and ingenuity, 1765–81 ‘The Blacksmith’, from The Book of Trades (1824).	watt	trades
  that were a close fit to each other; if there was any gap between the two, steam would leak through and the engine would come to a halt.	watt	engine
  Finding a suitably elastic but durable ‘packing’ material to fill the gap between piston and cylinder while still allowing the former to move up and down caused major delays to the engine’s development; Watt experimented with cork, pasteboard, leather and linseed oil.	watt	cylinder
  Later he even resorted to ‘horse-muck’ and ‘paper pap mixed with flour paste’.	watt	
  Finally, the piston had rope wrapped around its circum - ference, compressed tight by a ‘junk ring’, and this worked well.		
  But the best strategy was to make the cylinder as accurately as possible and, for this, Watt depended on the ingenuity of John Wilkinson who, in 1775, made a cylinder-boring machine.	watt	machine
  A cylinder, cast from iron as a tube open at both ends, was secured on its side upon the machine and a boring bar was placed along its axis, also supported at both ends.	cylinder	machine
  The bar supported a cutter that was advanced along the bore by a rack, rotating as it went and cutting the cylinder straight and perfectly true.	cylinder	cutter
  The degree of accuracy Wilkinson acquired using 129 gentlemen of merit and ingenuity, 1765–81 A model of John Wilkinson’s mill for boring steam engine cylinders, 1775.	wilkinson	cylinder
  The cylinder is held down on its side with chains, and sectioned so that the cutter working inside can be seen.	cylinder	cutter
  this machine was unequalled in its time; Watt boasted that ‘Mr Wilkinson has bored us several cylinders almost without error, that of 50 in.	watt	machine
  diameter . . . does not err the thickness of an old shilling at any part.		
 .’61 The cylinders on Watt’s experimental engines, at 18 inches’ diameter, might vary in diameter by around 1/8 of an inch.	watt	cylinder
  With Wilkinson’s machine, a cylinder almost three times larger could be machined to a maximum error of around 4 millimetres.	wilkinson	machine
  Here was precision manufacturing scaled up from scientific instruments to steam engines.	steam	instrument
  Having made the unfinished components, and the cylinder, it was now time to fit them together.	cylinder	
  The first step was to gather all the engine parts at the site where they would be assembled.	engine	
  As far as possible, heavy parts like cylinders were moved by water, from Birmingham by canal, from Wilkinson’s Bersham works via the River Severn, and then around the coast until as close the final destination as possible.	birmingham	cylinder
  But after that the final leg was completed by road, with huge teams of draught horses, supplemented by teams of men if, as in Cornwall, the mines were perched on cliff-tops or on rugged moorland.		
  The arrival of all the parts on site marked the first time the complete engine would have been united at a single location.	engine	
  The engine erector and his team had the first chance to inspect every- thing, and parts would often be missing, or the wrong size.	engine	
  Erecting the engine was not just a matter of final assembly, but of completing a major part of the actual manufacturing process.	engine	erecting
  Assuming the engine house walls were in place, the first step would be to install the engine beam, lifting it about 18 feet to the top of the engine house using pulleys and ropes, first raising one end, then the other, and then placing it approximately in position.	engine	beam
  The next major step was to fit the cylinder and align it perfectly on its foundations.	cylinder	
  This needed careful use of a weighted plumb-line to achieve per- pendicularity, wedges for adjustment and long bolts to hold the whole securely.		
  With these two main parts positioned, the rest of the engine could be assembled.	engine	
  It might take four or five weeks to complete, and came with attendant risks to the men involved – Boulton wrote home from Cornwall in 1779, ‘Tom Bowden has had two of his fingers burnt one quite broke off James Darlestone james watt 130 his hand much hurt, so that out of seven we have but four that can work.	watt	boulton
 .’64 The opportunities for injury reflected the nature of the engine- erecting process.	engine	erecting
  Fitting the components together would emerge in time as a distinct trade.		
  Much of the fitter’s work would be con- cerned with the accurate cutting and shaping of metal components using a range of basic hand tools: hammers, chisels, files and drills.	chisels	chisel
  Hammers and chisels were used to chip away metal.	chisels	chisel
  The chisel was up to 8 inches long, with a convex cutting edge.	chisel	
  It was used to make a series of cuts across the surface to be removed, about one-thirtieth of an inch deep.		
  The first layer of cast iron chiselled away could be the most difficult, as it would be impregnated with sand from the moulds it was cast in, which destroyed the chisel’s cutting edge.	mould	chisel
  If a lot of metal had to be removed, huge ‘flogging’ chisels, over a foot long, were used, with one man gripping the chisel in both hands and another wielding a sledgehammer.	chisels	chisel
  Tallow, rendered from mutton or beef fat, would be used to lubricate the chisel’s motion and protect the cutting edge, but the hammer and the end of the chisel were kept scrupulously clean to avoid blows glancing 131 gentlemen of merit and ingenuity, 1765–81 The View of Botallack Mine by Philip Mitchell, 1840.	chisel	
  Botallack was famous for its precarious position, and the workings extended some way under the sea.		
  off and causing injury.		
  Having chipped off as much as they could, engine erectors then reached for their files to complete the surface to a fine finish.	engine	
  Even in the 1820s, the cost of producing a perfectly flat cast-iron surface was twelve shillings per square foot – one of Boulton & Watt’s engine erectors in Cornwall might earn nine shillings per week.	watt	engine
  Drilling holes in metal was equally time-consuming and labour- intensive.		
  For the size of work needed on a steam engine, the brace would be the most effective tool, made of metal as opposed to the wooden braces used by carpenters.	steam	engine
  The brace would turn a flat drill rather than the spiral fluted twist drill used today; the flat drill had a pair of cutting edges meeting in a point, and worked not by cutting the metal but by scraping it.		
  To assist in this onerous task a lever or heavy weight could press down on the top of the brace to apply pres sure onto the drill, but often two men would be needed to turn the brace, sometimes spooning linseed oil into the hole formed to cool the drill.		
  A larger hole could be made by drilling through a number of times and rounding out the hole with a file; or, more commonly, it was easier to cast a hole bigger than needed and then use wedges to secure whatever passed through it into position.		
  Watt would have been acquainted with the techniques of foundry, forge and fitting even before he began his partnership with Boulton.	watt	partnership
  From 1765, as well as making scientific instruments in Glasgow, and his experimental engine at Kinneil, he had built a small number of atmospheric engines for customers in Scotland.	glasgow	instrument
  And as the engine grew from a benchtop model to an industrial machine, Watt grew as well, noting in 1769, ‘I am not the same person I was four years ago when I invented the fire engine . . . the necessary experience in great was wanting; for acquiring it I have met with many disappoint - ments.	watt	machine
 .’70 By ‘in great’, Watt meant the ability to build a full-scale machine, and this ability was now to be tested to its fullest extent: between 1776 and 1778 orders for 22 engines came from Cornwall, along with almost the same number again elsewhere across Britain, and the practical burden of constructing them fell on Watt’s shoulders.	watt	machine
  Such were the calls on his time and expertise that he wrote to Boulton in February 1778: ‘I fancy I must be cut in pieces and a portion sent to every tribe in Israel.	watt	boulton
 .’71 james watt 132 The physical and mental exertions of erecting engines placed Watt under enormous pressure; here was a man who had previously admitted he would ‘rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain’.	watt	erecting
  But the pressure to design and build machines, struggling against the limitations of tools, materials and workmen, and working under adverse conditions a long way from home, also told in Watt’s family life.	watt	machine
  In July 1776 he married his second wife, Annie McGrigor, daughter of a Glasgow-based bleacher – illustrat- ing Watt’s continued associations with the chemical industry.	watt	glasgow
  The opportunity was taken to move into a bigger house in Birmingham, and bring from Scotland Watt’s children from his first marriage, Margaret and James.	watt	birmingham
  Their mother was dead, they had been left with relatives when aged only six and four respectively, and now they faced losing their father again as he drove forward the engine business in Cornwall.	watt	engine
  Two new children arrived: Gregory in October 1777 and Jessy in May 1779.		
  But with their father often absent from home, and Annie vociferously advancing her own children, Watt’s family life thereafter would not be happy.	watt	
  By 1785 Watt’s relation - ship with his elder children had broken down: Margaret married without his consent in 1791 and moved to Scotland, having four children of her own but dying in childbirth in June 1796.	watt	
  She had not heard from her father for two years.		
  James junior remained on difficult terms with his father, finding Matthew Boulton a more sup- portive figure, culminating in a period of rebellion, the context and consequences of which will be explored later.	james	boulton
  Any consolation from the presence of younger Gregory and Jessy would be short-lived: Jessy succumbed to tuberculosis in 1794 aged only fifteen, and a decade later that disease also claimed Gregory, a promising and talented young man intended to follow Watt into the engine business.	watt	engine
  It is likely that Watt could at least have salvaged his relationship with Margaret and James, if only he had been a more permanent presence in their lives; such could be the cost of making machines.	watt	machine
  Matthew Boulton was also heavily engaged in Cornwall.	boulton	
  He rolled up his sleeves and dived into the fray, writing to Watt that ‘of all the toys and trinkets which are manufactured at Soho, none shall take the place of fire engines in respect of my attention’.	watt	engines
 .’75 Presently Boulton and Watt appointed William Murdoch as their chief representative in Cornwall, his technical skill and ability to take on fractious Cornish miners with his fists if so required – an option hardly open to the reticent Watt – giving him considerable authority, and freeing Boulton and Watt for other activities.	watt	boulton
  For Watt this meant working at his home in Birmingham with an assistant on calculations, correspondence and drawings, and only occasionally venturing onto the shop floor.	watt	birmingham
  This way, he could play to his strengths, leaving the outward-facing part of the busi- ness to Boulton, and turning his attention to some of the other innovations that would support the engine making process.	watt	engine
  The main challenge facing Watt was that, unlike making buttons, build- ing engines remained dependent on a relatively small, multi-skilled group of men.	watt	button
  Good mechanics were scarce: Watt told his engineer friend John Smeaton that he wished he could ‘find operative engi- neers who can put engines together according to plan, as clockmakers do clocks – we have yet found exceedingly few of them’.	watt	engineer
  Watt’s use of clockmakers as an exemplar is interesting, because in clock- making one man still made a complete clock from start to finish – unlike buttons, there was little, if any work specialization.	watt	button
  So Boulton & Watt’s men tended to be jacks of all trades, and they were expected to excel in all of them, producing ‘the well-known “Soho workmen”, whose services were sought directly or indirectly wherever their fame had spread’.	watt	trades
  Ensuring that these men could work as effectively as possible required a range of supporting tools and techniques, and this became Watt’s preserve.	watt	tools
  This comes with a caveat, however.		
  Although Watt has received the credit for many of these improvements, we should not forget that others were the responsibility of his relatively unsung colleagues on the shop floor at Soho and elsewhere.	watt	forge
  For example, William Murdoch had quickly become Boulton & Watt’s leading pattern maker before being sent to Cornwall, and there his abilities led him to james watt 134 make small, largely unauthorized adjustments to the engines as they were built – often to Watt’s irritation.	watt	engines
  Later the success of Boulton & Watt’s engine for driving factories as well as pumping water depended on Murdoch, as did much of the machinery required to build engine components at Soho.	watt	machine
  With men of this calibre engaged by the company (and Watt described Murdoch as ‘the most active man and best engine erector I ever saw’80), there was a constant flow of changes that did not necessarily begin life in Watt’s hands.	watt	engine
  First came new paper systems.		
  In 1779, Watt wrote his Directions for Erecting and Working the Newly-invented Steam Engines.	watt	erecting
  This was the first book anywhere devoted to the steam engine, and it codified all the practical experience of engine making acquired over the previous three years.	steam	engine
  It was intended to counter a steady flow of enquiries from engine men working across the country, and came with printed checklists of engine components to use when work - ing on site – Watt later used spare copies to wrap up delicate items in his workshop.	watt	workshop
  Printed forms also detailed which iron founders would supply which components for each engine, with room left for dimensions and other notes and comments.	engine	iron
  Of particular importance was Watt’s method of letter copying.	watt	
  In order to record the voluminous correspondence that building each engine entailed, everything had to be copied longhand.	engine	
  Now, to save time and effort, Watt developed the first practical office machine, which he patented in 1780, and which Joseph Black praised for its ‘neatness and propriety’.	watt	machine
  Its working premise was simple: a letter was written using ink specially formulated by Watt.	watt	
  Then thin copy- ing paper was laid over the top, and both were squeezed between rollers, after which the duplicate could be read through the back of the thin copy-paper.	rollers	
  The ink was formulated to stay wet for around 24 hours so, in theory, several copies could be taken from a single original.		
  In practice this relied on the ink being very carefully pre- pared, and often the original might be smudged when first copied.		
  The copying press was hugely successful, simplifying the admin- istration of the engine-building business.	engine	
  A copy made by Watt, and preserved in his workshop, records that ‘Time, labour & money are saved, dispatch & accuracy are attained, and secrecy is preserved by this newly invented art of copying letters and other writings.	watt	workshop
 .’83 135 gentlemen of merit and ingenuity, 1765–81 Boulton and Watt formed a subsidiary company marketing the press to others; 630 were sold in its first year.	watt	boulton
  Well might Watt claim that ‘Every gentleman engineer must now wear a pocket rolling press.	watt	engineer
 .’84 Paper processes were matched by technical improvements to the engine itself.	engine	
  There was a move towards using standardized parts, which meant quicker initial construction and easier provision of spares in the event of a breakdown.		
  Boulton realized that other- wise, ‘if any misfortune should happen’ and, for example, the pump- ing engine for a mine was halted, floodwater might drown the workings, which ‘might be ruined before a piston rod could be made’.	boulton	engine
  Even a standard design of engine house was adopted.	engine	
  Quality was ensured by making at Soho all the wooden patterns which might be used for casting iron components, even if the casting itself was carried out elsewhere.	iron	
  And improvements were supported by care- ful experimentation.		
  For example, there survives from the firm of Boulton & Watt a set of four models of engine beams of different designs, which appear to have been tested to determine which was the strongest.	watt	beam
  Two have reinforcing wooden ‘queen posts’ and iron james watt 136 Roller press for copying letters, by J. Watt & Co., 1818.	watt	iron
  straps, together with over-scale hooks or rings to hang weights on, and the other two are wooden latticeworks, one of which actually broke during the course of experiments.		
  Finally, making measurements associated with the engine led to the development of new precision instruments.	engine	instrument
  The first of these was the micrometer, reputedly made and used by Watt from c. 1776, which used the rotation of a fine screw-thread to measure to within 1/1,900th of an inch.	watt	
  The instrument had originally been devel- oped by William Gascoigne for astronomical use, both measuring the diameters of stars and the angular distances between them.	instrument	
  Its adoption in engineering suggests the degree of accuracy to which Boulton & Watt aspired.	watt	engineer
  The second instrument points to the busi- ness model they adopted to make and sell the engine: it is a revo- lution counter.	watt	instrument
  Remember Boulton & Watt’s distinction between making the engine and exploiting it.	watt	engine
  Despite their best efforts they made very little money from the former: just a few late-arriving components, or a faulty casting, could turn a profitable job into a loss-making one.	watt	boulton
  Exploitation was where money could be made: Boulton & Watt’s engine was more efficient than the equivalent- sized atmospheric engine, so the partners charged a royalty for its 137 gentlemen of merit and ingenuity, 1765–81 Watt’s engine counter, c. 1781.	watt	engine
  An early batch of the counters was made by John Wyke of Liverpool, who had sold Watt instrument making tools earlier in his career.	watt	instrument
  use, initially a flat rate based on the saving in coal fuel consumed.		
  However, this caused disputes between Boulton & Watt and their customers, because engine use fluctuated: for instance, a mine pump- ing engine might stand idle in the summer when groundwater levels fell.	watt	engine
  Boulton complained: ‘It is rather hard to work without profit and then not get paid.	boulton	
 .’89 The answer was to record the number of working strokes made by each engine and then send a bill based on that, for which purpose Boulton & Watt had built a number of engine counters.	watt	engine
  They sat on the engine’s beam and, as it rocked up and down, a pendulum inside clicked back and forth, its movements captured by a set of dial wheels.	watt	beam
  The box was tamper-proof, and only Watt’s agents had a key.	watt	
  Here was an early application of power metering, the idea of which remains in use today.		
  It is tempting to say that Boulton’s declaration that he was making engines like buttons was canny marketing.	boulton	button
  But it was not empty rhetoric: he had to take a bold leap in the engine business for it to succeed because no one had undertaken such an ambitious project before.	boulton	button
  That leap had to be attended with measures to minim - ize risk.		
  Returning to that first engine, erected at the Bloomfield Colliery, the newspaper report of it beginning work breathlessly noted, ‘All the iron foundry parts were executed by Mr Wilkinson; the condenser with the valves, pistons and all the small work at Soho by Mr Harrison and others, and the whole was erected by Mr Perrins conformable to the plans and under the directions of Mr Watt.	watt	iron
 .’90 Wilkinson was at Bersham, Harrison at Soho, Perrins at Bloomfield and Watt at his house – separated by miles, but all working on the same project.	watt	wilkinson
  Boulton created what we will call a ‘dispersed factory’, and it was what a business analyst today might call ‘scaleable’: once the basic infrastructure was in place, it could be expanded as circum - stances dictated, without a detrimental effect on Boulton & Watt’s core interests.	watt	boulton
  This was no mean feat – in fact, it cannily exploited the fact that locally made components were cheaper than those made at Soho and could be shipped out to where they were needed.	cheaper	
  By 1800 Boulton & Watt had built 440 engines, each of which, with its attendant boilers for raising steam, was the size of a modern detached house.	watt	engines
  And by going out and hustling for the engine, Boulton freed up Watt to do what he could do best – working on the james watt 138 practical innovations that the business depended upon.	watt	engine
  We can close this chapter in Watt’s career by returning to those practical matters which took up so much of his time, and that of his colleagues.	watt	
  First, just as Watt was intrigued by heat, and measured it with thermometers, mechanics used heat to work metal, and measured it by the metal’s colour.	watt	
  They hardened and tempered their tools to give them a good cutting edge by heating them to a pale straw yellow for lathe tools, or a yellow tinged with purple for chipping chisels and saws.	lathe	chisel
  Foundrymen needed the right temperature to pour molten metal – too hot and the mould would be damaged; too cool and the metal would not pour smoothly: they watched for the sparks dancing atop crucibles of molten iron, cooling after pouring into the mould until the surface was effaced with glowing lines, as if ‘covered with thousands of wire-worms in great activity’.	foundry	iron
  Even today, the phrase ‘to strike while the iron is hot’ derives from the smith’s ability to gauge the welding heat of iron and effect a weld before the temperature fell.	iron	
  Heat was as much a mechanic’s practical tool as a subject of philosophical research.		
  Further, as measuring heat depended on the visual acuity of the smith, the potter or chemist, and the latter two employed their senses of smell and taste in pursuing experiments with chemical substances, so the sense of touch was essential to accurate metalworking.		
  Many of the tools used by smiths to work metal were manipulated not using long pieces of iron, the better to resist heavy usage, but with rods of hazel wood, carefully softened and bent to the desired shape, because a rigid iron handle would ‘jar in the hand’ of the blacksmith.	iron	tools
  The accuracy of a metalworker’s output depended on being able to maintain exact angles, and not accidentally rounding off corners.		
  The smith had to be certain of the feel of the work when it was resting completely flat on the anvil, and ensure that the hammer fell perfectly flat when it struck to avoid making an uneven surface.		
  He had to be able to turn the work through exactly 90 degrees, and make sure that the hammer would fall exactly centrally upon it – if a blow landed to one side, it would reduce the parallelism of the finished piece.		
  All this depended upon ‘that same degree of feeling, or intuition, which teaches the exact distances required upon the finger-board of a violin; which is defined by habit alone’.		
  139 gentlemen of merit and ingenuity, 1765–81 Second, making early engines depended on exercising craft skills, which in turn depended on simple hand tools made of steel as the principal available means of shaping metal.	engine	tools
  The steel tools – files and chisels, for example – may seem mundane, but without them, or with poor-quality steel, metalwork would have been slower, of lower quality and more costly.	engine	chisel
  Britain would not have gained her james watt 140 An Iron Foundery, Coalbrook Dale, 1799, print, Ackermann & Company, London.	watt	iron
  The dramatic scene is lit by the molten iron flowing from the blast furnace into moulds.	mould	iron
  early supremacy in making machines.	machines	machine
  The humble file would prove to be mightier than the sword.		
  Third, just as Watt’s work on the engine was driven by his moral dislike of wasting steam, so the engine’s design and construction was driven by minimizing the effort used in making its component parts.	watt	engine
  Metalworking was reduced to a bare minimum: nuts for bolts had only four sides rather than six, unless they were in hard-to-get- at places.		
  Later Watt developed his ‘parallel motion’ to connect the piston rod to the end of the beam, even though the former went up and down perpendicularly while the latter scribed an arc in the air.	watt	beam
  The motion was a parallelogram of metal rods, and may have appealed to Watt because it was a clever piece of geometry which he had already used on his perspective drawing machine.	watt	machine
  But, complex as it was, it required less work than the alternative of supporting the piston-rod with big vertical metal slides, which would have involved a huge amount of costly hand-chipping and filing to make.		
  This solution only became viable in the nineteenth century with the introduction of the mechanical metal-planing machine, which reduced the cost of making a flat metal surface from twelve shillings per square foot to less than one penny.	machine	
  And if metal wasn’t essential, wood was substituted instead for lightness and ease of working; most of the engine framing and the great beam were of wood, and the sounds of hammers ringing on anvils, and files cutting away metal, were matched by those of adzes, chisels and saws applied to components made from oak or deal.	engine	chisel
  Lastly, the presence of so much woodwork is a reminder that, although the engine became the emblematic machine of the new industrial age, it was being built in advance of many of the other industrial machines which would have assisted in its production.	engine	machine
  This made its construction dependent on craft skills from an earlier age: carpentry, blacksmithing and plumbing.		
  And it also had the effect of making the engine very functional in appearance.	engine	
  There was, initially at least, no decoration or ornamentation; the engine was an expression of engineering in austere terms.	engine	engineer
  In a way that is Watt’s character coming across in the technology he helped create.	watt	
  As for steam, we leave it at an important crossroads: in time engines would be made in the same way as buttons, but that was a 141 gentlemen of merit and ingenuity, 1765–81 little way in the future.	watt	button
  In the meantime Watt’s engine had captured people’s imagination.	watt	engine
  Watt wrote of his first Cornish engine at Wheal Bussy, Chacewater, that ‘all the world is Agog to see its performance.	watt	engine
 .’98 Within six years Boulton & Watt’s machine had almost entirely dis- placed the old atmospheric engine in Cornwall.	watt	machine
  The resources avail- able to make engines were sparse and the machinery was imperfect compared with later models, but in Cornwall, with its dense network of mines and workings, 52 engines had been built by 1800, along with 30 constructed by other engineers.	engine	engineer
  By the middle of the nine- teenth century more than 300 engines were at work.	engine	engines
  Here were entire landscapes overtaken and transformed by steam power, dotted with engine houses and mine workings, and busy with miners and trains of packhorses carrying the valuable metal ores away to be refined.	steam	engine
  It was a portent of things to come.	steam

  1781–95 The city of Manchester divided opinion.	manchester	
  Travelling from Stockport into the city in March 1785, a distance of about 7 miles, François de La Rochefoucauld saw ‘nothing but houses.	stockport	
  It is all one town, one continuous factory.	stockport	
  But he was pleased by what he saw at street level, writing that ‘after the capital, Manchester is the handsomest town we’ve seen in England.	manchester	
  It is well laid out; at least most of the streets are straight and the houses admirably built, of brick; the pavements are comfortably broad, the street-lighting good.		
 ’1 Robert Southey took a contrasting view in 1807.	robert southey	
  The differing experiences of these two visitors were occasioned by Manchester’s explosive growth.	manchester	
  In 1774, 24,386 people lived there; by 1788 the population had risen to 42,821, and then to 70,409 in 1801 – and it would double again by 1831.		
  Under population pressure the local infrastructure buckled and nearly broke.		
  But the town buzzed with life.		
  John Byng complained that ‘Every rural sound is sunk in the clamour of cotton works . . . and the simple peasant is changed into the impudent mechanic.	cotton	john byng
 ’4 Richard Colt Hoare noted that there was ‘less attention, less urbanity of manners; self-interest and busi- ness occupy the minds of the inhabitants and prevent that polish which the inhabitants of other towns . . . more frequently have in their manners’.		
  But others admired this; Jabez Maud Fisher was impressed that ‘the Value of an enterprizing and Oeconomical Spirit seems to pervade all its inhabitants.		
  The voice of industry is heard on every hand.		
  Idleness is disgraceful, and a Man without Business, or some occupation, Manchester does not own.	manchester	
 ’6 Manchester was the city that set the benchmark for Britain’s new industrial towns, and the material that formed its primary prod- uct has also become an emblem of Britain’s Industrial Revolution: cotton.	britain	benchmark
  Here we will place Boulton & Watt’s engine within the context of the cotton industry, its places of manufacture and its output.	watt	cotton
  This is a relationship that has long fascinated historians, who have emphasized the role of entrepreneurs and businessmen, the relative costs of steam and water power and the risks of expansion as prime factors in keeping cotton manufacturing on a small scale.	steam	cotton
  As a consequence Boulton & Watt’s engine, rather than being the most important power source available, was but one of a number james watt 144 Peel & Williams Foundry, Manchester, 1814.	watt	engine

  Be that as it may, less attention has been paid to the input of the craftsmen commissioned to construct the mills and the machinery systems that production depended on, and which steam might drive.	foundry	machine
  With their backgrounds in constructing water mills and clocks, these craftsmen also played a part in keeping industry small, but perfectly formed.		
  Manchester was well placed to capitalize on the cotton trade.	manchester	cotton
  Situated in a giant natural arena surrounded by hills, the city and its environs had plentiful streams and rivers to drive waterwheels for industry.	waterwheels	waterwheel
  The town also commanded the trade routes between the Pennines and the sea at Liverpool, and had grown as a market- place where goods produced in the surrounding towns, such as woollens, linens and felts, were traded.		
  Cotton was a new trade which became, ‘in the short period of thirty years, one of the most flourishing and important branches of our national industry’.	cotton	
  Josiah Tucker wrote in 1782 that ‘silks, cottons and linens, combined in a thousand forms, and diversified by names without number, are now almost the universal wear.	cotton	
 ’9 During the eighteenth century raw cotton consumption grew from 1,000,000 lb to 56,000,000 lb every year.	cotton	
  British production of printed cloth grew from 20,000,000 yards in 1796 to nearly 350,000,000 in 1830 – enough to wrap around the equator seven times.		
  Everyone, it seemed, was in thrall to Manchester’s cotton.	manchester	cotton
  Part of cotton’s attraction was its versatility.	cotton	versatility
  It could be made tough enough for labourers’ corduroy trousers and even the belting later used to drive machinery, or fine enough for a ball gown, shirts and desirable clothing.	labourers	machine
  It could be dyed and printed with bright colours and patterns, replacing the sombre ‘drabs’ and ‘sads’ of woollen cloth.		
  This versatility made cotton a sought-after, fashion- able material.	cotton	versatility
  Fashion had always existed, but what characterized the fashion for cotton was the breadth and depth – one might say the intensity – of the demand for it.	cotton	
  People bought cotton clothing, altered it, made their own or purchased it second-hand.	cotton	
  They could buy new cotton clothes more frequently because they were cheaper.	cotton	cheaper
  By 1800 there were fourteen women’s magazines disseminating information on the latest fashions, and the demand for cotton goods led one wool merchant to complain that ‘ladies think no more of 145 steam mill mad.	steam	cotton
  1781–95 woollens . . . than of an old almanack’, and another to write that ‘cotton, cotton, cotton has become the almost universal material’.	cotton	
  The name indelibly linked with cotton manufacture is that of Richard Arkwright.	arkwright	cotton
  Described by Thomas Carlyle as a ‘plain, almost gross, bag-cheeked, pot-bellied Lancashire man’, he was trained as a barber in Preston, Lancashire, and most likely became acquainted with the developing cotton industry as he travelled collecting hair james watt 146 Margaret Bryan, astronomer and physicist, and her daughters, as portrayed in Bryan’s book A Compendious System of Astronomy (1797).	watt	cotton
  Fashionable cotton features strongly in their apparel.	james	cotton

  He worked in bursts of obsessive energy in days that sometimes began at 5 a.m. and finished at 9 p.m. Archibald Buchanan, who lived with him for a time, recalled that he was ‘so intent on his schemes’ that they ‘often sat for weeks together, on opposite sides of the fire without exchanging a syllable’.	james	thomas carlyle
  Arkwright’s success was based on a new type of cotton-spinning machine.	arkwright	machine
  Spinning relies on two processes that had always been per- formed by hand, one thread at a time: drafting, to tease all the cotton fibres out parallel, and then twisting, to bind them together.	james	cotton
  In 1769, the same year that Watt patented his separate condenser, Arkwright patented a machine that mechanized both of these processes: a series of pairs of rollers, each pair rotating slightly faster than the previous, 147 steam mill mad.	watt	machine

  The drafting rollers are at the top of the machine, and the flyers at the bottom.	rollers	machine
  pulled the cotton fibres straight and parallel, before a ‘flyer’ rotating at high speed twisted them together into a single thread.	cotton	
  But just as important as the technical achievement of the machine itself is the way in which Arkwright sought to exploit it.	arkwright	machine
  Having built his first mill in at Nottingham, he constructed others in Derbyshire, most notably at Cromford, and at New Lanark near Glasgow.	glasgow	arkwright
  He also licensed other spinners to use the machines as long as they did so in units capable of spinning 1,000 threads simultaneously.	arkwright	machine
  This measure was intended to allow Arkwright control over who used the machines, by restricting their use to only the relatively small number of people who could afford to build a mill on such a large scale.	arkwright	machine
  However, this had the contrary effect of stimulating piracy of his production methods by rivals, albeit by building mills on the same scale if they were to compete effectively.	arkwright	piracy
  The cotton industry exploded ‘with a vigour and activity which has no parallel’.	cotton	
  The number of Arkwright-type mills increased nine-fold to 182 – with around one-third of them in Lancashire – between them capable of spinning 1,900,000 cotton threads simultaneously.	arkwright	threads
  Arkwright provided the stimulus for a new factory system.	arkwright	
  Arkwright’s conceptualization of the factory certainly caught the imaginations of many of his contemporaries.	arkwright	
  Writing in 1790, John Byng was awestruck by the sight of Arkwright’s mills at Cromford, Derbyshire, working 24 hours per day, ‘seven stories high, and fill’d with inhabitants, [they] remind me of a first rate man of war; and when they are lighted up, on a dark night, look most luminously beautiful’.	arkwright	john byng
  Jabez Maud Fisher had earlier written of Cromford that the way ‘the [water]wheel sets in motion many thousands of others; and the Sight of all this variety of motion is the most pleasing imaginable’, and that it was ‘the Greatest Curiosity in the Mechanical Work in Great Britain’.	britain	
  Arkwright’s scheme speaks to our traditional view of the Industrial Revolution as characterized by large-scale, powered production in a factory.	arkwright	revolution
  However, it is telling that the power applied by Arkwright at Cromford came not from steam engines, but from a water wheel – and his cotton spinning machines were widely referred to as ‘water frames’ because of this.	arkwright	machine
  Lancashire became one of the most important markets for Boulton & Watt’s steam engine, but the partners did not corner the market in engines, and engines were james watt 148 not necessarily the power source of choice.	watt	engines
  How Boulton & Watt competed, and against whom, will be considered next.	watt	boulton
  The early 1780s were busy for Boulton & Watt.	watt	boulton
  They were building steam engines to pump water from mines, and customers in Cornwall demanded their full attention.	steam	engines
  They had built three engines there by 1778, eight more by 1780, no fewer than nine in a single year in 1782 and fifteen more by 1786.	engine	engines
  The engine had matured into a proven design and for Watt, the chance to consolidate this success must have been welcome.	watt	engine
  However, Boulton was already realizing what the engine’s potential would be if it could not only drive recipro - cating pumps, but produce a turning or ‘rotative’ motion to power machines in mills and factories as well.	boulton	machine
  He told Watt, ‘The people in London, Manchester, & Birmingham are Steam Mill Mad, & therefore let us be wise & take ye advantage.	watt	steam
 .’23 Watt’s interest in engines that would produce a turning motion – called rotary or rotative engines – was long-standing [illus.	watt	engines
  43].		
  As far back as 1766 he had been working on what he called his ‘steam wheel’, a complex machine that used mercury as a ‘liquid piston’ for steam to press against.	watt	machine
  Watt had great hopes for the wheel, projecting one up to 24 feet in diameter, and Boulton confi- dently predicted, ‘If we had a hundred wheels ready made . . . we could readily dispose of them.	watt	boulton
  Therefore let us make hay while the sun shines.		
 .’25 Boulton’s projections outran what was technically pos- sible and ultimately the wheel was not marketed.	boulton	
  However, Boulton did not forget the potential market for such a machine.	boulton	machine
  With the demand for mine engines in Cornwall soon to be satisfied, he per- suaded Watt that ‘there is no other Cornwall to be found’: the future lay in some other form of rotative engine.	watt	engines
  Watt was initially reluctant.	watt	
  He cautioned that the engines needed by mills and workshops would be smaller and less powerful than those needed by mines, but would be no quicker to design and build.	boulton	engines
  However, the work of competitors in the field provided impetus for revisiting his earlier proposals.	boulton	
  In 1779 Matthew Wasborough, a Bristol engineer, patented several ways of connecting an engine to a large flywheel which would produce a rotative motion and ensure the engine would continue to move as the piston changed direction at each end of its working stroke.	engine	engineer
  The possibilities for such an engine 149 steam mill mad.	steam	engine
  1781–95 are reflected by the fact that Wasborough detailed no fewer than 29 different uses for it in his patent.	wasborough	
  In December 1779 Watt was exploring the use of a crank – already widely used to drive grind- stones, potter’s wheels and foot lathes.	watt	exploring
  A Soho pattern maker, Dick Cartwright, was asked to build a model, but Cartwright found his tongue loosened by beer in a Soho public house, declared the idea ‘one of the best things Mr Watt had ever brought out’ and even went so far as to chalk a plan of it on a table.	watt	
  The plan quickly came to the attention of James Pickard, an.	james	
ther Birmingham engineer, who patented it before Watt.	watt	engineer
 Boulton & Watt now found themselves having to find a way round the patents held by Pickard on the crank and Wasborough james watt 150 Fragments of Watt’s rotary engine, 1782.	watt	wasborough
 These were found in a box in Watt’s workshop and are the oldest surviving relics of the quest to build an engine using a pure rotary motion.	watt	workshop
 on the flywheel.	flywheel	
 They devised five alternative methods of creating a rotative motion.		
 Of these the most successful of all was the brain- child of Watt’s assistant William Murdoch, the ‘sun and planet’ gear.	watt	
 It comprised two gear wheels, the ‘planet’ gear fixed on the end of a connecting rod suspended from the engine’s rocking beam, and the ‘sun’ gear fixed on the end of the shaft forming the axis of a flywheel.	engine	beam
 The teeth of both wheels were held together by a link, so that as the engine worked and the beam rocked up and down, the planet gear followed a circular path around the sun gear, making it rotate.	engine	beam
 The sun and planet gear offered a credible way for Boulton & Watt to build a rotative beam engine, and they patented it in 1781.	watt	beam
 But it was just one part of a whole package of improvements to the 151 steam mill mad?.	steam	beam

 This model was used by Boulton & Watt to guide the development of the full-size version for the rotative engine.	watt	engine
 engine that they developed and attained patent protection for during the 1780s.	watt	engine
 Chief among them was the ‘expansive’ use of steam.	watt	steam
 Rather than steam pushing the engine’s piston through its entire stroke, Watt realized that as steam has a natural propensity to expand, it would continue to push the piston even if the supply to the cylinder was shut off early.	watt	cylinder
 The engine was also redesigned to make it ‘double-acting’; that is, steam not only pushed the piston down, but up as well, combining with the effect of the sun and planet gear to provide the smooth, constant power output essential if the engine was to be used by textile mills.	steam	engine
 The final major improvement was to find a new way of attaching the piston to the beam.	beam	
 The old atmos- pheric engines only required strong wrought-iron chains for the piston to pull down upon.	engine	engines
 But with double action the piston’s upward stroke would simply double up the chains.		
 To get around this, Watt developed his ‘parallel motion’, a parallelogram of metal rods that provided a flexible but resisting connection between the piston rod and beam.	watt	beam
 Watt was particularly proud of its graceful motion, calling it ‘one of the most ingenious, simple pieces of mechanism I have ever contrived’.	watt	
 The first of Boulton & Watt’s rotative engines set running outside Soho was built for John Wilkinson in 1783, and by 1800, they had built 278 as opposed to 171 pumping engines.	watt	engines
 Boulton & Watt’s customer list reflects the rotative engine’s utility in a wide range of tasks.	watt	engine
 Customers included lead works, rope works, malt distilleries, sugar, tobacco and snuff manufactories, druggists, rolling mills, forges and foundries, glazers, bark and cork mills, even a mustard manufacturer.	forge	
 So Boulton & Watt’s engine was in considerable demand from customers spread broadly across Britain, and three- quarters of English counties had one at work.	watt	engine
 There were also large concentrations of engines working in relatively small areas, and one of the greatest of these was in Lancashire, with 44 engines erected by Boulton & Watt for cotton mills, along with eleven more in other industries.	watt	cotton
 But not all was as the raw numbers suggest.		
 Boulton & Watt’s rotative beam engine was a highly effective machine, but there was not necessarily a clear-cut link between steam power and production.	watt	machine
 Potential customers’ power requirements varied considerably.		
 james watt 152 Overwhelmingly the demand for power – of any type, steam or water – was for small units.	watt	steam
 For many producers, remaining small offered distinct advantages: less risk of overcapacity in a downturn, the ability to more easily change production to suit markets.		
 Sheer size ‘guaran - teed neither efficiency in good times nor viability in bad’.		
 Even where a factory was big, it was not necessarily power-hungry: Boulton’s Soho Manufactory and Wedgwood’s Etruria works used steam for some processes, but many of their workshops demanded no more power than could be provided by a foot treadle or a kickwheel.	watt	workshop
 It was common, where a large mill building was constructed, only to grad - ually fill it with machinery, or even sublet space to different companies, offering ‘room and power’ in return for rent.	machine	
 The average Boulton & Watt engine built before 1800 developed only 15 horsepower.	watt	horsepower
 So, potential customers for their rotative engine wanted power, if they wanted it at all, on a small scale.	watt	beam

 Many prospective customers were also very timid in their approach to power.		
 Although they might have had experience of production driven by waterwheels or even horses, they were less likely than miners or colliery owners to have prior experience with any sort of steam engine, meaning they needed more guidance in commis- sioning and operating new plant.	steam	waterwheel
 They could be led astray by engine builders like the two Matthew Boulton described as ‘drunken, idle, stupid, careless, conceited rascals [who] say, and their masters seem to believe, that it required the learning and knowledge of a University man to keep an engine in order’.	boulton	engine
 There was less enthu- siasm for adopting an efficient but relatively unproven Watt engine if there was any chance of it being less than entirely reliable.	watt	engine
 Best to rely on a tried and tested alternative.		
 Often that alternative was a variant of Newcomen’s atmospheric engine.	engine	
 This could be connected to a crank and flywheel to make a rotative motion; it might not work very evenly, due to the engine’s single-acting cycle, but could sometimes be made more so by using a heavy weight on the flywheel to act as a counter to the engine’s power ful downstroke.	engine	flywheel
 Or, more simply, an atmospheric engine could be used alongside a waterwheel, recirculating water from below the wheel to a reservoir above it.	engine	waterwheel
 If the water supply was reli- able, the engine might need to be used only in the event of a summer drought.	engine	
 Both these schemes found favour because manufacturers accepted the atmospheric engine’s higher fuel consumption as a price worth paying for simple and reliable operation.	engine	
 In advance of developing their sun and planet engine, even Boulton & Watt’s ‘Old Bess’ engine was used at their Soho Manufactory to recirculate water over a wheel, and John Wilkinson had one at his ironworks, ‘an engine of great magnitude which brought up the contents of the river as it were at one stroke’, that ‘shook the buildings and ground for a considerable distance’.	watt	iron
 Further, waterwheels remained a serious proposition for many prospective customers.	waterwheels	waterwheel
 They were by no means a crude alternative to steam power.	steam	waterwheel
 The same year that Watt patented his separate condenser, 1769, John Smeaton was beginning to apply cast-iron compon ents to a wheel at the Carron Foundry in Scotland, which was ‘found to answer much better than wooden ones’ and was james watt 154 ‘constantly recommended afterwards by Mr Smeaton for other mills which he designed, and by degrees came into very general use’.	watt	smeaton
 By substitution of cast iron, careful testing and design, Smeaton doubled the waterwheel’s efficiency.	smeaton	iron
 The capabilities of waterwheels are suggested by one that Jabez Fisher saw at Stockport, 40 feet in diameter but so finely poised that it was ‘turned by about as much water as could go out of a Pint Mug’.	waterwheels	stockport
 A waterwheel like that installed at Arkwright’s Cromford mill might generate 12 horsepower but, by 1800, wheels of 80 horsepower were in use.	arkwright	horsepower
 In the following decades, they reached 100, even 200 horsepower – far more than the steam engines then available.	arkwright	horsepower
 These developments reduced the incentive to adopt steam power.	steam	
 If they wished to purchase an engine, customers need not turn just to Boulton & Watt: there were many other competing firms.	watt	engine
 Some, like Matthew Murray in Leeds, presented a major challenge, being ‘the first to set an example to Boulton and Watt themselves in that superior finish to the steam-engine which has now become general’.	watt	steam
 In Manchester the company of Bateman & Sherratt was acknowledged as having ‘very ingenious and able’ engineers who built engines that were ‘of a small size, very compact, stand in a small space, work smooth and easy, and are scarcely heard in the build- ing where erected’.	manchester	engineer
 Others were less of a threat: an engine built by Ebenezer Smith and Co. was described by James Lawson, an engine erector for Boulton & Watt, as ‘one of the worse made I ever saw’.	watt	engine
 As in scientific instrument making, there was room alongside the very best for those building machines that were just sufficient for the job in hand.	instrument	machine
 John Farey recorded that in the early 1790s ‘great numbers’ of old atmospheric engines were being constructed to drive mills on account of the cheap coal available locally: ‘These engines answered the purposes for which they were applied, and were used for many years.	engine	engines
 ’49 It is telling, then, that Manchester 155 steam mill mad?.	manchester	steam
 1781–95 writer John Aikin recorded that only ‘some few [engines] are also erected in this neighbourhood by Messrs Bolton and Watts’ [sic].	watt	neighbour
 So, although Matthew Boulton predicted that rotative engines presented ‘a field that is boundless’, this declaration did not neces - sarily transpose into orders for engines.	boulton	engines
 Boulton & Watt’s engine, for all its technical prowess, was one of a number of potential options which could be provided by a range of different suppliers.	watt	engine
 Out of more than 2,000 engines built in Britain by 1800, two-thirds were of the older atmospheric type, and Boulton & Watt built only one- quarter.	watt	engines
 What mattered more to their customers than the sheer scale and the type of power source used was the modernity and ingenuity of the machinery that it drove.	machine	
 This was reflected in the contrast, noted by visitors to Manchester, between the smoke and confusion outside the mills, which was in large part produced by steam engines, and the precision mechanical movements of the production machinery within.	manchester	machine
 One of visitors’ abiding memories of Manchester was its ‘dark black smoaky atmosphere’, the product of a growing number of chimneys, each connected to a boiler for raising steam.	manchester	steam
 In 1786 there was only a single chimney in the town but by 1801 there were more than 50 and, visiting the town in 1802, Eric Svedenstierna was moved to write how ‘in order to carry away the coal-smoke, the chimneys at most of the mills are taken up high above the roofs.		
 ’54 Together they supplied the town with a constant fug of smoke, ‘an inky canopy which seemed to embrace and involve the entire place’.		
 Alongside the polluted atmosphere, Manchester at street level must have been an assault on visitors’ senses; in 1835 Alexis de Tocqueville described ‘the crunching wheels of machinery, the shriek of steam from boilers, the regular beat of the looms, the heavy rumble of carts’ as ‘the noises from which you can never escape in the sombre half- light of these streets’.	manchester	machine
 If the external effects of engines were the subject of negative comment, the machinery inside, by comparison, left a very favourable impression on those who saw it.	engine	machine
 In 1782 an anonymous author wrote that ‘those who are lovers of invention, and fond of mechanical im provements, must admire the ingenuity of the cotton mills and the engines lately erected in the neighbourhood of Manchester’.	manchester	neighbour
 james watt 156 In 1786 Joseph Smith & Robert Peel of Manchester summed up the main advantage of the English cotton trade as arising ‘from our machines both for spinning and printing; by means of these we can spin both cheaper and better, and we can print . . . cheaper and better’.	watt	cheaper
 And from a slightly later vantage point Edward Baines attributed to cotton machines ‘as great a revolution in manufactures as the art of printing effected in literature’.	revolution	machine
 Britain became the world’s principal textile manufacturer by solving the mechanical problems of production – and that was most evident among the whirring shafts and spinning flyers inside the mills.	britain	
 A question arises, then, over who the people were to best deliver this modern, mechanical world.		
 Earlier chapters have explored the links between blacksmithing, instrument making and early machine making.	instrument	machine
 Another major source of engineering skill was among millwrights.	engine	engineer
 This class of men emerged to design and construct windmills and watermills, pumping machines and ‘all the various kinds of rough machinery in use’ into the nineteenth century.	machines	machine
 A vivid description of the millwright has been provided by William Fairbairn.		
 He characterized the millwright as a ‘jack-of-all-trades, who could with equal facility work at the lathe, the anvil, or the carpenter’s bench . . . he thus gained the character of an ingenious, roving, rollicking blade, able to turn his hand to anything’.	lathe	
 Millwrighting was originally a peripatetic job, and millwrights, ‘like other wandering tribes . . . went about the country from mill to mill, with the old song of “kettles to mend” reapplied to the more important fractures of machinery’.	machine	
 However, as the eighteenth century progressed, more millwrights were employed at a single site.		
 Fairbairn was apprenticed to the Northumberland millwright John Robinson, who maintained all the machines working at a colliery and who, perhaps because of his wide responsibilities, had a ‘rough, passionate temper’ and ‘indulged in . . . profane swearing, carried to such an excess that an order was scarcely once given unless accompanied by an oath’.	machines	machine
 Elsewhere Fairbairn notes the existence of Millwrights’ Institutes in public houses, where drink and disagree - ment over points of practical science led to members imparting knowledge with a fist aimed at ‘the sensitive parts of the body, instead of appealing to the higher organs of intellect’.	ment	science
 157 steam mill mad?.	steam	
 1781–95 Such men, at once foul-mouthed, belligerent and highly skilled, found themselves drawn in two directions.		
 Engines like Watt’s, which required precision manufacture, needed the facilities of a dedi cated works, making use of specialized equipment like cylinder-boring machines and lathes.	watt	machine
 In these places the millwright became sub - sumed into the machine making profession alongside engineers, turners and fitters, working alongside carpenters, wheelwrights, cabinetmakers, joiners, smiths, clockmakers and others attracted from their original trades by better wages.	engine	engineer
 However, a second path allowed mill wrights to retain a distinct identity: the engine (or other power source) still had to be assembled on site, and its power trans- mitted to the production machinery that it drove.	engine	machine
 This remained the millwright’s specialized domain.		
 In fact those writing in the early nineteenth century pointed to Watt’s engine and Arkwright’s cotton-spinning machines as leading to the advance in millwork, making the expert millwright more indispensable than ever.	watt	machine
 The millwright’s particular job was to construct the shafts and wheels known as ‘mill-work’, needed to couple a power source to the production machinery.	machine	
 This entailed planning out the entire scheme, calculating the proportions and strength of the individual parts and determining the arrangement of the machinery.	machine	
 The mill- work was required to be strong, stiff and ‘easy of repair’.		
 Fairbairn recalls rising with the sun in summer, and some hours before it in the winter . . . For the remainder of the day I had either to draw out the work, or to ride fifteen or sixteen miles on a hired hack to consult with proprietors, take dimensions, and arrange the principle and plan on which the work was to be constructed.		
 Practical work was matched by skill at negotiation and draughts- manship as well.		
 All was underpinned by the millwright’s ability to manipulate materials.		
 At first, they worked mainly with timber, forming ‘large square shafts and wooden drums, some of them 4 feet in diam- eter’ but this, with other associated pieces of mechanism, ‘not only crowded the rooms, but seriously obstructed the light where most james watt 158 required, in the more delicate and refined operations of the different machines’.	watt	machine
 Wood began to be replaced with metal to better withstand the higher speeds at which the machinery was required to operate; bulky millwork was shrunk, the ‘ponderous masses of wood, cast iron, and their enormous bearings and couplings’ giving way to ‘slender rods of wrought iron and light frames or hooks for sus- pending them, [and] pulleys and straps of moderate diameters and dimensions’.	iron	machine
 So, the means of building the internal systems of a mill were provided by the millwright, using many of the techniques used to construct engines that we have earlier discussed.	engine	engines
 But alongside them worked a second distinct group of workmen, from the world of clockmaking.	engine	clockmaking
 As the eighteenth century progressed, and possession of a time- keeper became as much a mark of social standing as it was a record of timekeeping per se, horology was a growing trade.		
 It was also highly skilled, requiring ‘no great strength’ but ‘a mechanic head, a light nice hand; and a strong sight, there being scarce any trade which requires a quicker eye or steadier hand’.		
 These factors attracted James Watt, who took an interest in clockmaking alongside his other 159 steam mill mad?.	watt	clockmaking

 projects.		
 He and his friend William Small were exchanging notes on a new design of clock in 1771, with Small telling Watt how ‘I have perfected my clock with one wheel of nine inch diameter, which is to tell hours, minutes, and seconds, and strike, and repeat, and be made for thirty shillings.	watt	
 ’73 And even before that, in 1758, Watt was in partnership with Joseph Black and Alexander Wilson to make clocks – his workshop contains an incomplete timepiece movement and a number of unfinished clockwheels that may date from this period.	watt	partnership
 How clockmaking was organized varied across Britain.	britain	clockmaking
 At one end of the scale were the makers based in London.	makers	
 The metropolis was home to a complex trade exporting finished clocks all over the world, comprising large numbers of specialized workers – Abraham Rees counted up to eighteen different trades – movement makers, spring makers, enamellers, brass founders and more.	trades	brass
 The move- ments, springs, chains and cases were all manufactured by different tradesmen, though it was the watchmaker who ‘puts his name upon the plate, and is esteemed the maker, though he ha[d] not made in his shop the smallest wheel belonging to it’.	ment	trades
 In contrast to the London trade stood those making clocks who might have been trained as blacksmiths and in associated trades, build ing locks or even firearms.	trades	
 Their biggest products would have been large ‘turret’ clocks intended for churches and other places from where the time was told by the wider public.		
 These clocks were accurate timepieces but, owing to their physical size, their construction owed as much to the blacksmith as to the bench-based clockmaker.	clockmaker	
 For this reason, these self-contained and multi-skilled tradesmen have sometimes been called ‘clocksmiths’.	tradesmen	trades
 The nature of the clocksmith’s workshop reflected their combin - ation of skills.	workshop	trades
 It would ideally admit as much natural light as possible, to illuminate intricate work such as polishing, engraving and mark- ing out clock dials.	workshop	
 The bench would be positioned close to the window and, if very small work was carried out there regularly, might have a groove along its front and ‘wings’ around the sides to catch com pon ents rolling off.		
 For very small work, wineglasses broken off at the stem were traditionally used, turned upside down, to protect delicate components placed beneath them while a mechanism was 161 steam mill mad?.	steam	
 1781–95 dismantled.		
 But alongside the bench for small work, the workshop would also contain much shared with the blacksmith: ‘forge, bellows, anvil, tongs, hammers, screwplate and taps, bench and hand vices, drills, and pliers’.	workshop	
 The forge might be placed in a separate, darker room, or as far away from the window as possible, the better to accu- rately gauge the colour and working temperature of the metalwork being heated upon it.	forge	
 The presence of the forge is a reminder of the need to heat materials so that they could be shaped.	forge	
 Much clocksmith’s work was carried out in brass, rolled into sheets or cast into columns, gear- wheels or plates.	brass	
 The plates would then be hammered flat using a round-faced planishing hammer to avoid leaving sharp indentations before hand-filing to a smooth finish: brass can be ‘work-hardened’ – that is, the more it is worked, with a hammer, file or in the lathe, the tougher it becomes.	lathe	brass
 Wrought iron would be used to fabricate larger clock frames and movements, the pieces being heated and shaped using hammers and an anvil, and held together by nuts and bolts or wedges driven through holes.	iron	
 The clocksmith had to carefully consider the relationship between these different materials.		
 Components bearing onto each other, like clock-wheels and the smaller pinion wheels which connected them, were usually of different materials, brass for the former and steel for the latter.	brass	
 This reduced the amount of friction generated and used the stronger material where the strains imposed by the clock mech- anism were largest.		
 Although it was less easily shaped than brass, steel was cheaper: in the early eighteenth century it might cost one penny per pound compared to ten pence for brass.	brass	cheaper
 So clocksmiths were prepared to use steel to save money on materials, even if it took longer to work, and it was sometimes employed for parts that were hidden away inside the mechanism, unseen.	clocksmiths	
 Alongside tools like hammers and files, which might be found across a variety of trades, clocksmiths were early in adopting special-purpose tools.	clocksmiths	tools
 The latter were particularly useful in making the gear wheels, often referred to as ‘wheel-work’, that much of a clock movement consisted of.		
 In a relatively small movement, these wheels were often stamped out of brass: material was removed to save weight, leaving spokes behind.	brass	
 Then teeth were cut into the james watt 162 circumference in two stages: a wheel-cutting engine would first produce an approximate form of the teeth, with a parallel-sided cut.	watt	circumference
 Then the teeth were ‘rounded up’, the corners removed and a smoother profile made, using a shaped cutter, which laborious task would previously have been carried out by hand-filing.	cutter	
 How the wheels meshed together would be carefully checked with the special - ized clocksmith’s depthing tool to ensure that they engaged cleanly, and then they were held in place in the clock movement, most often between two vertical plates separated the required distance apart by brass pillars, with the wheelwork positioned between them.	brass	
 The complex processes of clockmaking produced, and attracted, self-sufficient and innovative craftsmen.	clockmaking	
 James Watt was joined by Benjamin Huntsman, who pioneered the process of making high- quality ‘crucible’ steel in Sheffield in 1740 having started out as a clockmaker, his interest in steel emerging from the quest for a better material to make springs.	watt	clockmaker
 In 1741 the clockmaker Henry Hindley of York showed the engineer John Smeaton a screw-cutting lathe and a wheel-cutting machine he had constructed – both of which were later to be widely adopted in industry.	lathe	engineer
 Later the advertisement placed in the Manchester Guardian newspaper by young engineer Richard Roberts in 1821, whose ‘self-acting’ spinning machine trans- formed Manchester’s cotton industry, was decorated with images of what look like clock and pinion wheels.	manchester	engineer
 These examples show that there were extensive connections between clockmaking and larger-scale engineering, and this was widely commented upon by contemporaries.	engine	engineer
 Thomas High’s cotton- spinning machine of 1738 was moved ‘by an aggregate of clock- maker’s work and machinery most wonderful to behold’.	cotton	machine
 The Manchester Mercury newspaper in the 1780s and ’90s contains a series of advertisements for clockmakers to work in cotton mills and with machine makers to ‘fitt up the clock work for mules and water machines’.	manchester	machine
 It is surely no coincidence that Abraham Rees found himself noting that ‘there are such immense numbers of each part of every machine to be made, it becomes, in the same manner as with the clock-maker, worth the machine-maker’s trouble to con- struct complicated tools and engines to expedite the manufacture of the parts.’.	engine	machine
 And in Sheffield George Gilpin was inventing a method 163 steam mill mad?.	steam	
 1781–95 of cutting wheels from solid cast iron ‘with as much accuracy and as good a finish as brass wheels have hitherto been cut, making a very great saving in the expence of brass for a large mill, and much more durable when done’.	iron	brass
 In fact, looking at machines like Arkwright’s prototype, the gears driving the drafting rollers are brass clockwork scaled up for industry; John Kay, who built the machine for Arkwright, was a clockmaker by training, and the cover story for that top-secret project was that he was building a navigation device to establish longitude.	arkwright	machine
 So, between them, clocksmiths and millwrights were capable of building complete production systems, integrating power sources, transmission systems and production machinery.	rollers	machine
 One innovation particularly encapsulates the precision that was now possible: many mills mounted a pair of clocks side by side, one turned by the mill gearing driving the machinery, the other independently regulated by a pendulum in the usual manner.	machine	
 Both were made with dials and hands exactly alike, but with the former having ‘a title on the dial, mill time, and the other, clock time’.		
 The motion of the mill was so regular ‘that these two clocks will never vary more than two or three minutes’.		
 Rather than just the power source or steam engine, contemporaries were amazed at the possibility of constructing entire factories – modern, often small, but perfectly formed – that could operate with the precision of a timepiece.	steam	engine
 This was achieved in large part using long-established materials.		
 The adoption of iron was spreading but it by no means replaced wood entirely; the great working beams of Boulton & Watt’s engines only began to be made from cast iron in 1800, for example.	watt	beam
 Clocks might have been framed in metal, but scaling this up into production machinery able to withstand greater stresses and strains required better understanding of how to proportion iron parts to balance both lightness and strength.	iron	machine
 So the water frames at Arkwright’s Cromford mill, each capable of spinning 48 threads at once, were principally built from wood, as was Samuel Crompton’s ‘mule’, the waterframe’s successor.	arkwright	threads
 For this reason we might describe the early industrial machines as examples of ‘conservative modernity’, state-of-the-art new production machines, built using old-established materials and techniques by millwrights and clocksmiths.	clocksmiths	machine
 james watt 164 The traditional nature of the craft skills employed in devising new production machines did not reduce their imaginative influence over those who saw them.	watt	machine
 Quite the opposite: Louis Simond visited Barclay’s Brewery in London, writing how the engine working there stirred ‘to the very bottom the immense mass of malt in boilers 12 feet deep’ and drove ‘elevators which nobody touches, carry[ing] up 165 steam mill mad?.	steam	engine

 Boulton & Watt capitalized on the imaginative attraction of machines by establishing a series of showcase engine installations.	watt	machine
 The mine pumping engine at Ting Tang in Cornwall was joined by rotative engines at the Whitbread Brewery and Albion Mill in London, showing what was possible in brewing and corn milling respectively.	engine	engines
 A renowned visitor to the Whitbread engine, in May 1787, was George iii.	engine	
 Watt met him, noting how he was ‘most graciously received by the King, who expressed himself most highly pleased with everything he has seen’.	watt	engine
 The royal visitor would have been equally impressed by the Albion Mill, with a pair of sun and planet engines driving up to ten sets of millstones each.	engine	engines
 It was the largest corn mill built up to that time and the first establishment to use cast iron for all its machinery.	engine	machine
 Showcases like this helped consolidate the company’s reputation for the future.		
 To fully secure the company’s future prosperity, one last, major matter remained to be resolved.		
 In Cornwall mine owners depended on Boulton & Watt’s engine to keep their mines free of floodwater economically, but bitterly resented paying a royalty for the privilege.	watt	engine
 Watt wrote of their complaints, ‘They say it is inconvenient for the mining interest to be burdened with the payment of engine dues, just as it is inconvenient for the person who wishes to get at my purse that I should keep my breeches-pocket buttoned.	watt	button
 ’95 In the late 1780s, as Boulton and Watt turned their attention to the rotative engine, two competitors, Jonathan Hornblower and Edward Bull, designed and constructed pumping engines that could compete with theirs on an equal footing – and they had a ready market among the recalci - trant Cornish miners.	watt	engines
 Watt contended that both Bull and Hornblower infringed his patent on the separate condenser and in 1792 began a legal battle against them that took seven years to resolve.	watt	condenser
 The initial proceedings were indecisive, raising hopes among Watt’s com- petitors – and, indeed, the many other pirates of his engine design who stood behind Bull and Hornblower – that his patent might be declared void.	watt	engine
 Pirates were at work closer to home than Boulton & Watt realized: without their permission, John Wilkinson, upon whom they depended for engine cylinders, built and sold no fewer than 34 engines based on their designs, and this indicates the high financial stakes for all concerned in the form of unpaid engine royalties.	watt	cylinder

 1781–95 Hornblower held out to the very end: the validity of Watt’s patent was only finally upheld in 1799, upon which he and Boulton immediately sued for payment from all the engineers copying their separate condenser, and Cornish miners who had withheld payment for using the engine pending a legal decision.	watt	engineer
 In total they stood to gain £162,000 (more than £10 million at today’s prices) – the amount they actually received was less, but still enough for Watt to retire from the business on a comfortable income.	watt	boulton
 Thus was passed a major milestone in handing over to the company to Boulton & Watt’s successors – their sons.	watt	boulton
 The legacy of Boulton & Watt as their partnership ended in 1800 has proved controversial.	watt	partnership
 They had established an ‘industry standard’ for the steam engine – a basic pattern of a useful, efficient, and reli- able machine – and produced ten times more engines than their next james watt 168 A Boulton & Watt engine at Fazeley Street Rolling Mills, Birmingham, 1790–1800, as illustrated in Tomlinson’s The Useful Arts and Manufactures of Great Britain (1861).	watt	machine
 biggest competitor.		
 Even top-quality competitors like Matthew Murray in Leeds ‘attempted to improve the construction of Mr Watt’s engines’, but after some years were ‘obliged to follow the models of the engines made at Soho’.	watt	engines
 Some historians have argued that the authority Boulton & Watt wielded was ‘sufficient to clog engin - eering enterprise for a generation’.	watt	boulton
 There is a broad consensus that the extension of Watt’s patent right up to 1800, matching the length of his intended partnership with Boulton, did act as a brake on the wider development of the engine.	watt	partnership
 However, up to 1800 and even beyond, the small scale of industrial enterprise, even in textiles, where powered machines ‘achieved their most famous triumphs’, limited the demand for radical transformation in engineering technique.	watt	engineer
 What was needed, as this chapter has explored, could be met by adapt - ing and scaling up existing, long-established craft skills.		
 Despite the patents on their engine, Boulton and Watt by no means monopolized those skills.	watt	engine
 And after 1800 the construction of machines by machines would remain exceptional for several decades.	machines	machine
 William Fairbairn wrote that, as late as 1817, ‘even Manchester did not boast of many lathes or tools, except small ones in the machine shops’, and that even when assembling complete cotton mills, ‘Our means were but small; we were without a steam-engine, or any other power, except Murphy [an Irish labourer] and three more assistants who turned the lathes.’.	manchester	machine
 103 The time when Sir George Head would see ‘the beam of an engine, weighing three tons’ being worked on in a lathe and ‘not withstanding its vast weight, revolving on a point which entered only three quarters of an inch, with as much ease as if it had been a peg top’ was some time in the future.	lathe	beam
 So a range of new oppor- tunities, including innovation in machine tools, remained open for machine making men to explore in the nineteenth century.	tools	machine
 Boulton & Watt’s engineering achievements were not the ne plus ultra of engineering but a symbol of what could be done.	watt	engineer

 The locality was becoming increasingly populous, and the ‘many respectable residences’ were commented on by local historian George Yates, who described ‘a barren heath . . . [now] covered with plenty and population’.		
 And as travellers approached Boulton and Watt’s Soho Manufactory, Yates also noted how they passed ‘gardens, groves, and pleasure grounds’ that rendered Soho ‘a much-admired scene of picturesque beauty, where the sweets of solitude and retirement are to be enjoyed, as if far distant from the busy hum of men’.	watt	manufactory

 Fischer’s first port of call was the engine yard at the Soho Manufactory, and he was ‘dumbfounded’ at what he saw: ‘No descrip- tion could do justice to the building in which these works are housed.	manufactory	engine
 I was amazed at both the great masses of iron and at the skill which the workmen had devoted to the construction of the building.’.	iron	
 3 He then visited the turners’ and smiths’ workshops, where he ‘admired the wonderful craftsmanship of the smiths’ and a workshop con- taining ‘a large number of copying machines and here again I could not help admiring the characteristically high standard of craftsman- ship of the workers’.	workshop	machine
 The following day Fischer was admitted to the latest buildings where engines were constructed – a highly unusual event, since what happened within was usually kept carefully hidden from the outside world.	engine	engines
 He wrote that 170 six Inventive, Creative Genius, 1795–1819 The works are completely enclosed by a high wall and consist of several separate buildings, each of which is many hundreds of feet in length.	inventive	
 The most important are the foundry, the pattern shop, and the new workshop.	foundry	workshop
 Four furnaces produce enough molten iron to enable castings to be made up to a weight of 200 hundredweight.	iron	
 In all these buildings steam engines were at work, performing their tasks ‘quietly, regularly and efficiently – a tribute to all that human ingenuity has contributed to their construction’.	steam	engines
 What is most notable about Fischer’s account is who was responsible for what he saw in the works.		
 From the workshop making copying presses, to the design of the foundry, was not the work of James Watt and Matthew Boulton but of their sons, James Watt Junior and Matthew Robinson Boulton.	watt	workshop
 We have seen how their fathers developed steam engines, first for pumping water and then, from the 1780s, for producing a rotative motion.	watt	engines
 We have also recounted briefly the legal measures taken to secure Watt’s patent of 1769 and underpin the prosperity of the company before 1800.	watt	
 This chapter will explore the means by which the business was con- tinued in the hands of the next generation after 1800: how the men who drove the business forward were trained, the nature of the challenges that they faced and how they responded to them.		
 There took place what we will call an ‘affective revolution’ in engineering, which turned the engine from just a machine into a product of which its creators’ antique forebears might have been proud.	engine	engineer
 Two major technical issues affected the firm in the late 1790s.		
 First, and most importantly, established suppliers could no longer be relied upon.		
 The ironmaster John Wilkinson had made the majority of Boulton & Watt’s engine cylinders, but a bitter feud with his brother, and the revelation of his piracy of Boulton & Watt’s engine designs, brought the association to a close.	watt	piracy
 The capacity for Boulton & Watt to accurately make cylinders – the heart of each engine – had to be acquired as a matter of some urgency.	watt	cylinder
 Second, work was being put in hand to standardize the design and manufac - ture of engines at Soho.	engine	engines
 Matthew Boulton had suggested a ‘pattern card’ of engines in standard sizes in 1782, and four years later, Watt 171 inventive, creative genius, 1795–1819 proposed to ‘methodize the rotative engines so as to get on with them at a great pace’.	watt	inventive
 Some aspects of the move towards standardiza - tion are still with us today: for example, Watt defined ‘horsepower’ as a unit of measurement for the first time, as a way to compare the power output of different engines, and to help establish how much machinery engines with different power outputs could drive.	watt	machine
 This new and enduring definition represents a major rethink of how the company worked.		
 Whereas production had previously evolved in an organic way, a new scheme was now in prospect: the Soho Foundry, the secretive works visited by Fischer in 1814.	foundry	
 The Soho Foundry was designed from the start along rational, pre-planned lines.	foundry	
 Entirely separate from the old Soho Manufactory, the Foundry began work in the spring of 1796, and was intended to construct a standardized range of engines, from an 8-horsepower engine costing £525 (or about £20,000 at today’s prices), progress- ing in increments up to a 50 horsepower engine costing £2,109.	foundry	horsepower
 To construct this range, particular care was taken in arranging how the Foundry operated.	foundry	
 As one account has styled them, the senior Boulton and Watt were builders, but their sons were organizers.	watt	boulton
 This new project brought the organizational talents of the junior Boulton and Watt to the fore.	watt	boulton
 Of the two, James Junior was the foremost, with the younger Boulton concentrating more on the other out put of the Soho Manufactory and new ventures in minting coinage.	james	manufactory
 The Foundry was built around nine workshops, each dedicated to a particular process: for example, cylinder boring, turning, fitting, smithing and pattern making.	foundry	cylinder
 The shops were positioned so that the movement of heavy iron components was minimized, or made as easy as possible, and men were appointed to particular work specialisms.	iron	
 For example, ‘Wells and two assistant men, one lad’ were ‘employed constantly’ in fitting engine nozzles, controlling the flow of steam in and out of each engine’s cylinder.	steam	cylinder
 William Buxton and John Mincham were dedicated to ‘turning, draw filing and finishing piston and air pump rods’.		
 ‘Foreman and three assistants, with lad to grind chisels’ were assigned to ‘sundry chipping’ of iron surfaces.	chisels	chisel
 And increasing use was being made, not just of hand skills, but of purpose-made machine tools: special lathes for pistons and shafts, vertical drills in the fitting shop and other lathes devoted james watt 172 to woodturning and making engines’ parallel motion, all with ‘connecting machinery’, the shafts and gears allowing them to be driven by steam.	watt	machine
 But what really stands out is how all these elem - ents – workplace, workman, process, and tools – were carefully specified, one might even say choreographed, in sequence for each engine, from the first step of making the cylinder lid, to the final one of packing everything up ready for dispatch to the customer.	engine	tools
 Even the speed of the individual machine tools was defined.	tools	machine
 Not for nothing did Eric Roll, whose researches unearthed the details of production at Soho outlined here, claim that ‘neither [Frederick] Taylor, [Henry] Ford, nor other experts devise anything . . . that cannot be discovered at Soho before 1805.’.		
 8 The Soho Foundry was vital to the continued success of Boulton & Watt, and it came alongside a business strategy that was markedly different from that previously adopted, and which contributed to the company’s success into the nineteenth century.	watt	foundry
 This strategy was based on innovation both in products and in the markets where they were sold.	watt	boulton
 As well as building beam engines, the company recognized the increasing demand for smaller, more compact and self-contained engine designs.	engine	beam
 One of the most prominent of these products was the ‘bellcrank’ engine, which replaced the rocking beam with a pair of triangular levers, or bellcranks, pivoting on the engine’s sides.	engine	promin
 The large, cast-iron bellcranks were liable to break after a time, but the design remained in production until 1814, when self-contained beam engines were introduced as an alternative.	engine	beam
 Over the period from 1804 to 1847 the firm built 286 marine engines – as a rough guide, about one every two months.	engine	engines
 As well as new products the company also more actively sought new markets.		
 An office was opened in London, primarily to obtain 173 inventive, creative genius, 1795–1819 orders for marine engines from prestigious customers like the Royal Navy and, later, the Post Office, which was developing a fleet of steam-powered mail ships.	steam	inventive
 Caribbean sugar plantations demanded engines to drive cane-crushing mills, and the company found itself working in Demerara, Trinidad and the West Indies as well as Manchester or Oldham.	manchester	engines
 A steady overseas engine trade was devel- oped: Boulton & Watt built just twelve engines for foreign customers between 1786 and 1795.	watt	engines
 However, between 1795 and 1825, they built 102 – the majority after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 – and they proved to be highly profitable.	watt	boulton
 The Soho Foundry was a major landmark in the history of machine making: it was the first purpose-built factory dedicated to constructing machines.	foundry	machine
 Such was the demand for its output that, even supplemented by the older engine workshops at the Soho Manufactory, there was still a waiting time of from eight to ten months between ordering an engine and taking delivery of it.	manufactory	workshop
 Consequently, the Foundry received a series of extensions to provide additional workshop space in the first eight years of its existence.	foundry	workshop
 By 1804 the total construction cost amounted to more than £27,000, over £850,000 at today’s prices, but the whole debt had been repaid out of profits by 1812.		
 If the Foundry’s success was as much a feat of organization as it was of engineering, what sort of education produced organizers like this?.	foundry	engineer
 The young James had been intended to have a similar grounding to his father: conventional training in carpentry along with book- keeping, mathematics and the rudiments of running a business, with a view to becoming an engineer or a manufacturer.	james	engineer
 Starting in May 1784, he was dispatched for a year to John Wilkinson’s ironworks.	wilkinson	iron
 But then, just four months into his placement, he was uprooted again to be educated in Geneva in natural philosophy, mathematics and drawing.		
 In the summer of 1786 he again moved on, to Eisenach and then Freiberg, to learn German, mathematics, chemistry and mining.	chemistry	
 By the middle of 1787 he was travelling the Continent, finally arriving home again in October.		
 If Watt Junior had received a thorough and comprehensive education, however, his efforts very often were seen in a dim light by his father.	watt	
 Through his letters Watt Senior applied constant pressure james watt 174 to work harder and achieve more.	watt	james
 He sent mathematical problems to test him, and exhorted him regularly to refrain from swearing, to be frugal and not to drink (or talk) too much, not to play cards, or indulge in theatre, music nor, it would appear, any other form of leisure.		
 Indeed, he was to be awake early enough to begin his stud- ies by six every morning.		
 Watt Junior wrote to Matthew Boulton, complaining that his father did not understand him, ‘never having been a young man himself’.	watt	boulton
 And his return to Britain saw little 175 inventive, creative genius, 1795–1819 Model bellcrank engine, possibly by William Murdoch, c. 1799.	britain	inventive
 The bellcrank engine was the first compact, self-contained engine available commercially.	engine	
 improvement in relations – in fact they deteriorated, and he finally quit his home, having discovered that his father did not consider him up to the job of running the engine business.	watt	engine
 Cast adrift, young Watt’s education took on a more rebellious nature.	watt	
 In 1791 he relocated to Manchester as apprentice with Taylor & Maxwell, a company of cotton dyers and printers, and came under the influence of Thomas Walker, an ardent republican whose views must have appealed to his latent sense of rebellion, and Watt james watt 176 James Watt Junior portrayed by an unknown artist, c. 1800.	watt	dyer
 Junior found himself taking a leading role in the city’s Literary and Philosophical Society celebrating the Revolution in France.	revolution	
 By the spring of 1792 he was travelling to France, even addressing the Jacobin Club of Paris – and his activities were soon denounced in the House of Commons in London.		
 Yet even as the younger and elder Watt traded letters arguing furiously the case for and against the French revolutionary cause, Watt Junior realized that he was in a dangerous predicament.	watt	revolution
 As the country descended further into political turmoil, he found himself a witness to bitter retribution and bloodshed; although the story that he only narrowly escaped arrest during the Terror is not quite true, he was lucky to escape when many others (including the scientist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier) lost their heads.		
 In England the reactionary government was sup- pressing dissent, and young Watt potentially faced charges of sedition.	watt	
 But Watt now offered his son a lifeline: credit so that he could remain in France until circumstances were right to travel back, and gentle encouragement that he would not lose face by returning, in letters which exuded ‘a warmth of affection I never before experi - enced from him’, confided young James.	watt	james
 By the autumn of 1792 he had quietly slipped back into Britain after a separation from his family and home of some five years.	britain	
 If James Watt Junior’s revolutionary education came to a prema - ture end, he still benefited from a further education of an affective nature.	watt	revolution
 Some historians have suggested that in the period after the French Revolution there can be detected among young people like James not just a desire to challenge authority in personal relation- ships and political life, but a heightened desire to experiment with ‘outrageous forms of expression or even with their own bodies’.	james	revolution
 This, it is argued, amounted to an ‘affective revolution’ in which people for the first time expected their emotions to have some kind of tangible expression.	revolution	
 Letters from young Gregory Watt to William Creighton, one of Boulton & Watt’s engineers, went beyond refer- ences to ‘filth, farting and explosions’ to include erotic imagery that went far beyond the usual young men’s humour.	watt	engineer
 Watt and his associates even sniffed nitrous oxide gas in Humphry Davy’s scien - tific laboratory.	watt	davy
 In December 1799 Davy sealed himself in an airtight box filled with 20 quarts of nitrous oxide, resulting in sensations 177 inventive, creative genius, 1795–1819 ‘superior to any I ever experienced.	inventive	davy
 Inconceivably pleasurable.		
 Ideas were more vivid & associated together much more rapidly & so associated with words as to produce, perceptions perfectly novel.		
 Theor ies passed rapidly thro the mind believed I may say intensely.		
 ’22 This wasn’t just a one-man project: Watt Senior designed and built the gas-making apparatus.	watt	
 The poets Samuel Coleridge and William Wordsworth were involved as well, mainly in an imbibing role.		
 This is not to suggest that early engineers and machine makers were all nitrous oxide fiends and libertines, although Joshua Field recalled the 1820s ironmaster John Tickle as ‘an extraordinary character – a kind of excentric genious a Chymist & a Poet’, which sounds close.	engine	engineer
 But those making machines in the decades around 1800 had an affective revolution of their own; it was not always catalysed by revolutionary politics, but was more likely to have its origins in the world of antiquity.	antiquity	machine
 Classical influences pervaded the education that a young man like Watt Junior might receive in the late eighteenth century.	watt	
 The historian Viccy Coltman writes that ‘education at public school amounted to a prolonged and thorough exposure in, first, the lan- guages of the ancient Romans and the ancient Greeks, and sub se - quently, to a selection of their literary works.’.		
 A student at Eton, for example, would attend 27 hours of teaching every week.		
 Of those, three hours were intended for mathematics and writing, three were taken up by religious study, and all of the remaining 21 hours – three-quarters of their time – were filled with antiquity, a diet that sustained them for six years.	antiquity	
 The influence of the antique is suggested by the schoolbooks, notebooks and reading undertaken by James Junior’s half-brother, Gregory, totalling approximately 120 items, which are contained in a hair chest stored inside Watt’s workshop.	watt	workshop
 Gregory died of tuber- culosis in 1804, aged only 27, and it would appear that his father was greatly affected by his death, because he had his belongings placed in the workshop where his eye could on occasion rest upon them.	watt	workshop
 Among the chest’s contents are a Compendious Treatise of Astronomy from 1762, chemistry notebooks, lists of books and tracts to be bound, notebooks and textbooks on maths, geography, navigation, astronomy and algebra.	chemistry	
 There are even 49 accomplished paintings james watt 178 and drawings, from anatomical sketches to images of Powis and Caernarfon castles in Wales and views of the Lake District and Clyde valley.	watt	james
 But very prominent are no fewer than 23 books relating to the classics, including A New English–Latin Dictionary by John Entick and Thomas Ruddiman’s The Rudiments of the Latin Tongue; Or, a Plain and Easy Introduction to Latin Grammar of 1782.	promin	
 Here is a young man’s grounding in antiquity captured in paper form.	antiquity	
 So, in advance of the emergence of a formal curriculum for training young engineers, their education might be both wide- ranging and disparate.	engine	engineer
 This broad education encouraged Watt Junior to take a different approach to building engines from his father.	watt	engines
 He was conscious not just of the technicalities of realizing new mechan - ical ideas, but of having to sell a product, a thing not just efficient and mechanically effective but packaged and marketed.		
 The next big challenge, which he faced alongside the wider machine making industry, was to go from building the steam engine per se to the steam engine as status symbol.	steam	machine
 This meant it had to change from being a purely functional machine to one which was also in large part an aesthetic one.	machine	
 And in this respect the world of the antique that Watt Junior experienced as part of his education comes to the forefront of the discussion: antiquity had considerable influence over the making of many types of products.	watt	antiquity
 Boulton & Watt’s work on the engine happened in parallel with tremendous popular appetite for the antique – the culture, archi - tec ture and artefacts of ancient Greece and Rome.	watt	engine
 Discoveries made during archaeological excavations at Herculaneum in 1738, Pompeii in 1748 and at Paestum in Southern Italy were widely broadcast in a series of books.		
 ’26 Ware was followed by James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, who published The Antiquities of Athens in 1762, and Johann Joachim Winckelmann, with his Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks in 1765.	james	sculpture
 And between 1746 179 inventive, creative genius, 1795–1819 Gregory Watt’s trunk, inside James Watt’s workshop.	watt	inventive
 and 1778 Giovanni Piranesi produced over 100 large, immaculately detailed and popular views of Rome.	piranesi	
 Rather than appealing just to scholars and antiquaries, these books’ descriptions and illustra- tions also became widely used source material for architects and designers, too.	tion	
 They also got into the hands of Watt’s associates.	watt	
 Matthew Boulton had all seven volumes of the French Comte de Caylus’ Recueil d’antiquités égyptiennes, étrusques, grecques, romaines et gaul oises, published in 1752–7.	boulton	
 Josiah Wedgwood took inspiration from Sir William Hamilton’s Antiquités étrusques, grecques et romaines of 1766–7, which he referred to as ‘Hamilton’s Antiquitys’.	antiquity	
 The archi- tect James Wyatt built the main building of the Soho Manufactory, with its imposing frontage, in 1765–7, described by historian Jennifer Tann as ‘a classic piece of English Palladianism’.	james	manufactory
 He also designed Boulton & Watt’s huge Albion Mill in London and refashioned Matthew Boulton’s Soho House in the Palladian style.	watt	boulton
 Antiquity permeated the environment in which they lived.	watt	antiquity
 There is a question over how far into the ranks of Britain’s machine makers antique influences pervaded.	britain	machine
 Not everyone had access to a classical education.		
 But Wedgwood commented how many customers had a discerning eye for the antique, noting how some likened a particular vase design to ‘the things on the tops of Clock cases, or Beds heads.		
 They are certainly not Antique, and that is fault enough to Damn them for with most of our cus- tomers.		
 ’31 And even without a formal introduction to the classical world, the workmen in a town like Birmingham would have had an eye for what looked right.	birmingham	
 Writing to Watt in 1775 regarding the design for a barometer, Gilbert Hamilton wished he could get some neat contrivance in order to make them in the form of a Corinthian pillar, the Base to open for adjusting them & on the top of the Pillar . . . to have a neat brass or bronze figure holding the scale.	watt	brass
 As the workmen with you are more in the way of fancy things they could hit if off better there than could be done here.	birmingham	
 With particular reference to those making machines, there survives a sketchbook that belonged to William Creighton, who 181 inventive, creative genius, 1795–1819 rose from erecting engines for Boulton & Watt to become head of their drawing office in 1815, and was a highly active contributor to James Watt Junior’s affective education.	watt	machine
 The sketchbook is a weighty tome, the size of two modern telephone directories, and among well-drawn maps and astronomical charts there is an entire section titled ‘Architectural Scraps’.		
 This is packed with drawings, not just of bridges, factory chimneys, and one or two mills, but principally of 56 British cathedrals in intricate detail, complete with measurements, antique temples, and over 100 Ionic, Doric and Corinthian columns, all carefully drawn, proportioned and dimen- sioned.		
 Creighton noted the source that inspired each drawing, and from this information we can see that he used Ware’s Complete Body of Architecture, the Antiquities of Athens and Chambers’ Treatise on the Decorative part of Civil Architecture (first published in 1759), as well as referring to Piranesi.	piranesi	antiquities
 These, then, suggest that others beyond Boulton & Watt took inspiration from the antique.	watt	boulton
 It may be that producing work inspired by antiquity was a more accessible occupation than it might initially appear.	antiquity	
 Piranesi declared in 1769 that ‘An artist, who would do himself honour, and acquire a name, must not content himself with copying faithfully the ancients, but studying their works he ought to show himself of an inventive . . . and of a creating genius.	piranesi	inventive
 ’35 Rather than rigidly copying antique forms, with all the study and scholarship of the literature that would entail, Piranesi suggests progressing beyond those forms, using them as a platform for exploration and invention.	piranesi	
 The springboard for this leap was already being assembled in the world of manufacturing and consumption as Boulton & Watt developed the steam engine.	watt	engine
 Antiquity inspired much of the output of Matthew Boulton’s Soho Manufactory.	boulton	antiquity
 In 1767 the Duke of Cumberland commissioned Boulton & Fothergill to make ‘three Great Solomonean Candlesticks’, each almost a metre tall, comprising fluted Corinthian columns on decorative plinths surmounted by the candleholders, themselves formed of decorative tripods.	watt	commissioned
 Slender wine jugs and flagons were made with vase-like bodies, tall ‘loop’ handles and surfaces deco - rated with Vitruvian scrollwork.		
 Candle vases and other exquisite objects were embellished with goat’s or lion’s head motifs, satyrs, james watt 182 Sphinxes, gold decoration, acanthus leaves, engravings of classical scenes and even beautifully detailed sculptural figures wearing robes.	watt	james
 Boulton pushed his workmen to the limit when producing such items: Josiah Wedgwood wrote that Mr Boulton was making an immense large Tripod . . . to finish the top of Demosthenes Lanthorn building . . . from Mr Stew- arts design.	boulton
