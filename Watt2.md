Patterns of Empire
The British and American Empires, 1688 to the Present
Patterns of Empire comprehensively examines the two most powerful
empires in modern history: the United States and Britain. Challenging the
popular theory that the American empire is unique, Patterns of Empire
shows how the policies, practices, forms, and historical dynamics of the
American empire repeat those of the British, leading up to the present
climate of economic decline, treacherous intervention in the Middle East,
and overextended imperial confidence. A critical exercise in revisionist
history and comparative social science, this book also offers a challenging
theory of empire that recognizes the agency of non-Western peoples, the
impact of global fields, and the limits of imperial power.

viiPreface and Acknowledgments
This book is about the American and the British empires. In the tradition of
macro-comparative historical sociology, it puts the two empires under a criti-
cal comparative lens. But this book is also meant as an assault. It is an assault
against a way of thinking called “exceptionalism.” Exceptionalism presumes
that the United States is special and especially benign. It assumes that the
United States has a unique and essential character. It assumes that the United
States exemplifies the most perfect liberal democracy in the world. It assumes
that understanding what the United States does abroad only depends on under-
standing what happens within the United States. It also assumes that the United
States and its people are the sole agents of history – whether for ill or for good.
Exceptionalism is the North American counterpart to Eurocentrism. It
silently structures thought. And it has helped to create and sustain empire.
It does this not only by heralding the American empire as unique, but also
by assuming the United States and its people have the privilege of directing
history. Any analysis of the American empire must therefore confront excep-
tionalist thought.
This book’s comparative analysis is hereby motivated. Comparison is mobi-
lized to confront exceptionalism. For this task, the tools of comparative-
historical sociology help. However, in its challenge to exceptionalism, the
analysis also derives much of its inspiration from postcolonial theory. Soci-
ologists do not often peddle in postcolonial theory. This book barely cites
any. Yet this book’s critique of exceptionalism, its associated emphasis on the
agency of colonized populations, and its implicit examination of the provin-
ciality of American empire would not be the same without the silent influence
of postcolonial theory’s critique of imperial knowledge.
Finally, this book might be read as marking a passing. Ten or twenty years
from now, to write about the American empire may be akin to writing about
the British empire today. It will be about something that has passed. Of course,
America’s global power is not yet withered. Its imperial manifestations persist.
If the comparison with the British empire tells us anything, however, it is that

America’s global hegemony is already over. Thus arises one of the sobering
if not frightful lessons from the comparison in this book: falling empires, like
rising ones, do not behave well. As the American empire falls, it will not go
down without a fight.
There are many to thank. Craig Calhoun, Fred Cooper, and Kevin Moore’s
“Lessons of Empire” conference at New York University provided an important
forum for me to explore initial ideas; participants there who gave me valuable
criticism and/or support include Matt Connelly, Ann Stoler, Jomo K.S., Stephen
Howe, and of course Craig, Fred, and Kevin. An invitation from Bat Sparrow
and Sanford Levinson to the University of Texas at Austin Law School per-
mitted me to test some early ideas on U.S. overseas colonialism. I am grateful
to them and to Christina Duffy-Burnett who pressed my thoughts in Austin.
Roger Owen and Eve Trout Powell invited me to their Imperialism Sympo-
sium at the University of Pennsylvania where I got insightful comments from
participants there, especially from Robert Vitalis, Engseng Ho, and Robert
Tignor. Julia Adams and Phil Gorski at Yale University invited me to their
Comparative Research Workshop, where Malik Martin, Jennifer Bair, and
Peter Stamatov among other participants offered helpful thoughts. Steve Pin-
cus’s invitation to attend his conference on colonialisms at Yale offered another
arena to test some ideas and receive helpful criticisms (from Steve and Peter
Perdue especially). Alyosha Goldstein hosted a productive visit to the Ameri-
can Studies program at the University of New Mexico. Gurminder Bhambra
kindly invited me to give two talks at Warwick, U.K. Other forums included
Boston College’s Department of Sociology; Brown University’s Department of
Sociology; the Colloquium on Comparative Research at the Watson Institute
and Rich Snyder’s and Barbara Stalling’s graduate seminar at Brown; and the
University of British Columbia. The history group at the Humanities Depart-
ment at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona offered a fantastic place to
think, write, and relax; thanks especially to Gloria Cano and Josep Delgado for
hosting me.
The indirect and direct guidance of Stephen Howe has been indispensable for
this book. In New York City at the “Lessons of Empire” conference, his remarks
about the British and U.S. empires helped initiate some of the ideas in this
book. And I still think fondly of a lively dinner in his Oxfordshire home with
Wm. Roger Louis years ago, an evening that inadvertently served to crystallize
some ideas herein. Stephen also read the entire manuscript and provided pre-
cise commentary, as did Ian Tyrrell to whom I owe so much. Julia Adams and
George Steinmetz continue to nurture and inspire. Phil Gorski perused an initial
draft and gave me encouragement when I needed it badly. Many others pro-
vided necessary comradeship, encouragement, humor, or helpful suggestions:
Nitsan Chorev, Filiz Garip, Neil Gross, Stefan Huemann, Victoria Johnson,
Krishan Kumar, Nicholas Hoover Wilson, Michael Mann, Renisa Mawani,
Roger Owen, David Swartz, Kathleen Schwartzman, Robert Vitalis, Geneviève
Zubrzycki, and my colleagues at Boston University’s Sociology Department.Preface and Acknowledgments

Empires in Comparison
We covet no territory, and we have no imperialistic ambitions.
– Sumner Welles, U.S. Secretary of State (1941)
America has never been an empire. We may be the only great power in history
that had the chance, and refused.
– President George W. Bush (2000)
Our nations covet no territory . . . only a safer world.
– Donald Rumsfeld on the United States and Britain in Iraq (2003)
America is not the crude stereotype of a self-interested empire. The United States
has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known.
We were born out of revolution against an empire. We were founded upon the
ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries
to give meaning to those words – within our borders, and around the world.
– President Barack H. Obama (2009)
These utterances by America’s prominent statesmen represent a longstanding
tradition of thought called “exceptionalism.” According to this tradition of
thought, the United States has always been different from other countries.
Unlike European nations, it lacks a feudal past. Born of an anticolonial revolu-
tion against a monarchy, it clings interminably to egalitarian, democratic, and
liberal ideals. Because of this unique history and national character, the United
States has never been an empire, nor could it ever be. George W. Bush’s claim
that America is “the only great power in history that had the chance [to be
an empire] and refused” is one expression among many of this exceptionalist
theme. Traditional scholarship on American foreign policy has espoused the
same idea, consciously avoiding terms like “imperialism” or “empire,” and
instead using terms like “diplomacy.” “One of the central themes of American
historiography,” observed the historian William A. Williams in 1955, “is that
there is no American empire.” 1

Patterns of Empire
One goal of this book is to critically reconsider these claims about excep-
tionalism. On what grounds can we say that the United States has been special,
different, or “exceptional”? Can we rightfully assert that the United States
has never been an empire? Is exceptionalism a useful way for thinking about
America’s past and present standing in the world?
In addressing these questions, this book will argue that exceptionalism
obscures more than it reveals. As a set of claims about what is or is not,
and as a mode of thought, exceptionalism should be rejected. Yet in mak-
ing this case, the point is not simply to assert exceptionalism’s opposite and
declare that the United States is and always has been an empire. Such a dec-
laration would not be new. Revisionist historians in the tradition of William
A. Williams have already mounted assaults on exceptionalism by unearthing
America’s real imperial history. Highlighting America’s westward expansion,
its treatment of Native Americans, the acquisition of overseas colonies like the
Philippines, and America’s multiple military interventions around the world,
these scholars and their successors have already shown us some of the ways in
which the United States has been an empire. An additional line of scholarship,
which we might think of as “neo-revisionist” scholarship has added further
insights, scrutinizing not just America’s imperial history, but also how that his-
tory has been erased in popular consciousness. According to this scholarship,
attempts to deny empire are but predictable manifestations of an “historical
amnesia” – a “denial and displacement” of America’s indisputable imperial
history. 2 Therefore, if there’s anything exceptional about America’s empire at
all, it is only that it is an “empire that dare not speak its name.” As Niall
Ferguson puts it, “the great thing about the American empire is that so many
Americans disbelieve in its existence.” 3 Denying empire is simply part of the
unique modus operandi of American empire itself.
There remain those who still insist that the United States was never a proper
“empire.” 4 Still, the growing acceptance of revisionist histories means that cri-
tiquing exceptionalism by reiterating America’s imperial past is not sufficient.
Calling the United States an empire does not have the potency it might have
once had. 5 In fact, despite the charges of neo-revisionists that America’s empire
is an empire in denial, popular discourse has become increasingly willing to
call a spade a spade. The phrase “American empire” appeared in one thousand
news stories over a single six-month period in 2003. During the early years of
the Iraq War, the discourse continued, leading the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
to declare that “the concept of America as world empire, so controversial as
to be almost unsayable just a few months ago, is now close to conventional

wisdom.” Even officials have uttered the once unutterable. In 2003, a senior-
level advisor to President George W. Bush stated: “We’re an empire now, and
when we act, we create our own reality.” 6 Nor was this specific to the post-9/11
era. Earlier, in 2000, Richard Haas of the State Department urged Americans
to “re-conceive their global role from one of a traditional nation-state to an
imperial power.” 7
America’s so-called amnesia and denial have abated. Apparently, the United
States is not always an empire that dare not speak its name. For these reasons,
a passionate declaration that there is an American empire would do little in
itself to either critique exceptionalism or enrich our understanding of American
power in the world. As the pundit Robert Kaplan wrote in the Atlantic Monthly,
“It is a cliché these days to observe that the United States now possesses a global
empire. . . . It is time to move beyond statements of the obvious.” 8 I agree. A
different approach is needed. Accordingly, this book raises and addresses new
questions – the very questions invoked by the growing acceptance of revisionist
thought. If the United States is and has always been an empire, does this mean
that it is exactly the same as other empires? If it is not exactly the same, in what
ways has it been distinct? If the United States is no longer an empire that “dare
not speak its name,” what remains of the notion of American distinctiveness,
of something different or unique about America’s global power? And what
accounts for any similarities or differences we might find?
Revisionist historians have opened up these questions about America’s simi-
larity or difference with other empires by alerting us to America’s long-standing
and widespread imperial practices. But they have not yet answered them. These
are comparative questions and, a few exceptions aside, comparative investiga-
tions of the U.S. empire are remarkably absent. This is a glaring omission.
Conventional exceptionalist thought and revisionist criticisms all depend on
comparison. To say that the United States is an “exception” is to say that it is
an exception to a rule against which American distinctiveness can be measured.
Similarly, to insist as revisionists do that the United States is and has always
been an empire is to claim that it fits into the rule rather than deviates from it;
that it is like or akin to something else. It is to suggest that the United States
has exhibited features or enacted policies similar to those of other empires such
that it is worthy of being called an empire in the first place. In other words,
both exceptionalism and the revisionist critique are predicated on a silent and
unstated understanding of other empires. They both depend on asserting an
imperial “rule” or pattern against which American distinctiveness is to be mea-
sured or rejected. Their claims therefore conjure the need to look beyond the
American empire, investigate other empires, and see how they fare in light of
each other. Answering any questions about what is similar or different about

the American empire demands a sustained systematic comparison that puts
America’s empire, both past and present, into a broader frame. 9
Take, for instance, the British empire.
Turning to Britain
It is well known that Britain forged one of the largest and most powerful
empires in the world over the course of the nineteenth century. This was an
empire that reached down to Africa and back up to India, across to Hong Kong
and down to Australia. Britain was also the world’s preeminent military and
economic power in the nineteenth century – sending its gunboats, money, and
missionaries to do the Crown’s bidding. An empire indeed. Still, not all Britons
were always ready to utter the words “British empire.” Historian Bernard
Porter, among others, has shown that most Britons from the early to mid-
nineteenth century were either ignorant of their empire or rejected the notion
of it. 10 Instead, terms like imperialism and empire in the mid-nineteenth century
were most often used to refer to Napoleonic France, not Victorian Britain. Even
when it did refer to Victorian Britain, it did not mean empire as we might think
of it today. It rather referred to “the United Kingdom of the British Isles and
to England in particular.” It was “rarely used in connection with topical issues
of foreign affairs.” 11 Only later, in the late decades of the nineteenth century,
did more Britons became cognizant of the British empire and come to freely
name it. It was only then, at that specific historical moment, when empire talk
among Britons proliferated.
These British perceptions and discourses of empire in the nineteenth century
are suggestive in various respects. First, they highlight that repressing, rejecting,
or denying empire is not particular to the United States. Even people in the
largest and most powerful empire of the time were not always quick to admit
that they were part of an empire. In fact, some historians and statesmen have
taken up the mantle of denial to suggest that a British empire never really
existed. 12 Second, the Britons’ discourse of empire shows a historical trajectory
in imperial consciousness not unlike America’s. Britons once denied empire but
later began to recognize it, admit it, and talk more about it. This proliferation
of empire talk among Britons in the late nineteenth century is akin to the
proliferation of American empire talk among Americans in more recent years.

Exceptions include Maier (2006) and Porter (2006). These works will be discussed throughout,
along with how this book differs significantly from them. A good brief overview comparison
between the U.S. and British empires can be found in Howe (2003), and a comparison of
historiography can be found in MacDonald (2009). There is an older tradition of comparing
British and U.S. imperialism (though this is different from a comparison of “empires”): These
include Darby (1987), Liska (1978), Smith (1981), and Winks (1997).

Koebner and Schmidt (1964), pp. 145–6.
See Powell (1969), p. 247. Also, historian John Darwin prefaces his recent work, The Empire
Project, by saying “the British Empire in its heyday was largely a sham.” See Darwin (2009),
p. xi. Such claims obviously depend on what one means by the word “empire,” an issue I take
up throughout.Introduction
5
If Americans used to deny empire, they have done so less and less since the late
twentieth century, just as Britons did in the late nineteenth century. In short,
there has been similarity in empire talk and consciousness between Britain and
the United States that would go undetected without an explicit comparative
analysis. Without placing discourses of empire in comparative light, we would
too easily and wrongly assume that denying empire is a distinctly American
phenomenon.
The comparison in the present study is premised on the assumption that a
systematic and sustained examination of other aspects of empire might likewise
yield insights into matters of exceptionalism and empire. It might reveal simi-
larities between America’s and Britain’s empire not just in discourse, but also
in policies and practices. It might also help to unearth differences between the
two empires and ultimately facilitate an explanation of whatever similarities
or differences we might find.
This sustained comparison is what differentiates the present study from the
revisionist historians’ earlier work and from more recent examinations of U.S.
imperialism. Although forthcoming chapters will indeed follow the revisionists’
path and explore U.S. imperial history, the point is not to simply to catalog
America’s imperial interventions or therapeutically utter empire’s name – as if
that is all that is needed to attain a critical understanding. Rather, by employ-
ing a sustained systematic comparison, this book hopes to ascertain what, if
anything at all, is distinctive, unique, or exceptional about American empire.
It likewise aims to explain whatever differences or similarities arise from the
comparison. Finally, this book seeks to raise some informed speculations about
America’s most recent imperial ventures in the early twenty-first century and
where they might go. In 1902, the British critic and early theorist of imperial-
ism J. A. Hobson wrote that “history devises reasons why the lessons of past
empire do not apply to ours.” 13 At that time, Hobson was criticizing his peers
who believed that Britain had nothing to learn from the rise and fall of prior
empires like Rome. In regard to the U.S. empire, we might similarly wonder
what a consideration of Britain’s imperial history has to say about America’s
imperial present and imperial future – if it has one at all.
First, though, our conceptual apparatus should be laid bare. A large part of
what is at stake in our comparison is determining exactly what it is that we
are comparing. So what exactly is an empire? What about related terms like
imperialism or colonialism? After defining these terms, we can better establish
the comparison and discuss the theoretical issues underlying it.
“Empire” and its Modalities
Defining terms like empire or imperialism is not a simple task. These terms carry
heavy political and emotional baggage. To some, calling the United States an
empire is to unfairly charge it with all kinds of wrongdoing and aggression.
Another problem is that meanings shift over time. The word empire in the
13

Patterns of Empire
twentieth century might signify something different than in the eighteenth.
To confuse matters even more, scholars sometimes stretch the terms for their
theoretical (or political) purposes. V. I. Lenin defined imperialism as a stage
of capitalism. Negri and Hardt conceptualize empire as multifaceted abstract
relations of power that encompass the globe. Others have spoken of “cultural
imperialism” or “economic imperialism.” 14
Definitions cannot be wrong or right. They can only be useful or not. Accord-
ingly, for the purposes of our analysis, this book offers non-normative defini-
tions that begin with elementary points. The goal is not to hurl accusations.
Nor is it to narrow the investigation. The goal is offer a conceptual apparatus
that can guide our investigation; to mark out some basic conceptual terrain.
The trick is to define our terms widely enough so as to be flexible to the reality
of history but narrow enough to be analytically robust.
To begin, power must be included in the definition. Empires, in their most
basic sense, are sociopolitical formations that are constructed and maintained
through the exercise of political power. This is not an arbitrary starting point.
The word empire derives from the Latin term imperium, which roughly trans-
lates as “sovereignty” or “rule.” During Roman times, imperium denoted the
capacity to wage war and make laws, thereby describing a sphere of authority. 15
Later, during the early modern period in Europe, the term imperium took on
added layers of meaning. Some usages rendered empire more or less synony-
mous with status or state. Other usages referred to an emperor or central
political authority ruling over a distinct if not distant set of territories. 16 When
Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, invaded Lorraine in the fifteenth century,
he referred to himself as “Emperor and Augustus” because he had come to
rule over two territories rather than one. Empire meant a diversity of territory
under a single authority. 17 Later, in 1625, Charles I probably meant something
similar when he declared Virginia and New England to be part of “our Royal
Empire.” 18 In all these instances, at the heart of the meaning of empire was
political power.
Most scholars today build on this basic notion of empire. On the one hand,
scholars have included various dimensions of empire beyond political power:
economic, cultural, religious, and even psychological. 19 On the other hand,
despite these possible multiple dimensions, most scholars would recognize
political power as the definitive feature. This is not because political power
is most important. Some might say the economy determines everything in the
last instance. Yet without the exercise of political power, there is no empire.
“Power,” writes the historian Dominic Lieven, “in its many manifestations is

the core and essence of empire.” 20 Sociologist S. N. Eisenstadt writes: “[T]he
term ‘empire’ has normally been used to designate a political system encompass-
ing wide, relatively centralized territories in which the center, as embodied both
in the person of the emperor and in the central political institutions, constituted
an autonomous entity.” 21 Political scientist David Abernathy defines empire
in “political terms as a relationship of domination and subordination. . . . The
distinctive core feature is political control.” 22 Empire, adds anthropologist Fer-
nando Coronil, refers to “relatively large geopolitical formations that establish
domination by hierarchically differentiating populations across transregional
boundaries.” 23
The concept of empire used in the present study follows from these basic
definitions. At the risk of sounding overly schematic, this book defines empire
as a sociopolitical formation wherein a central political authority (a king, a
metropole, or imperial state) exercises unequal influence and power over the
political (and in effect the sociopolitical) processes of a subordinate society,
peoples, or space. “A kind of basic, consensus definition,” Stephen Howe
fruitfully summarizes, “would be that an empire is a large political body which
rules over territories outside its original political borders. It has a central power
or core territory – whose inhabitants usually continue to form the dominant
ethnic or national group in the entire system – and extensive periphery of dom-
inated areas.” 24 Other terms used in this book follow accordingly. Empires are
involved in imperialism, which is the process by which they are established,
extended, or maintained. They often have imperial policies, which are official
and stated plans and practices by which power is exercised. 25 And they formu-
late various strategies and deploy multiple tactics, techniques, or modalities –
sometimes unstated or unofficial – to realize their policies and extend or sustain
themselves.
Keeping these basic definitions in mind is crucial for analytically differen-
tiating empire and imperialism from other phenomena. First, empire is not
the same thing as economic power. If a private corporation from a country
invests in a weaker country and influences its internal affairs, we might call
this “economic imperialism.” But in the conceptual apparatus here proposed,
this is different from the imperialism of a government. Empire entails political
exertions of power by a state. Although such exertions might accompany or
support a private corporation’s economic exploitation, empire implies that a
state is the main agent, and that the state directs, manipulates, or decisively
influences the political – rather than just economic – processes and policies
of a weaker society. Empire is a sociopolitical relation, not just an economic

one (even though the political operations of empire might entail economic
relations).
Empire must also be differentiated from a “great power.” A great power is
a state with massive military capabilities and/or extensive territory. But such
a state would only be an imperial state if the state uses those capabilities to
exert influence on other peoples or societies to incorporate them as dependent
satellites. A state that has the greatest military in the world but does not use
it to construct a hierarchy of power may not necessarily be an empire. The
United States may have the greatest military power in the world. It may also
cover extensive territory. However, if it does not hold colonial dependencies
or does not exert power over other societies, it would not be an empire (this
is why the scholar Dominic Lieven, for instance, does not consider the United
States today to be an empire, at least in its internal affairs: The “American
president does not rule without consent over vast conquered territories and
their populations”). 26 Of course, states with such internal capabilities, like the
United States, often do use their power in imperialistic ways. A state may be
a great power and empire at once. The point here is to analytically separate
the two. The issue is not whether a state has power (like military strength) but
whether and how that power is exercised. 27
A related distinction is between empire and “hegemony.” The concept of
hegemony first arose from Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci to refer to a
cultural or ideological process, but many scholars who deploy it today often
define it as an economic matter. In this conceptualization, a hegemon is a state
that enjoys relative preponderance over the world economy. A state enjoys
hegemony when it takes up the largest shares of the world’s economic activ-
ity (measured by relative share of world GDP, for example). 28 Accordingly,
hegemony and empire are not the same. A state can have an empire but not
dominate the world economy. Similarly, a state can dominate the world econ-
omy without being an empire. Moreover, if we define hegemony as cultural
influence, this would not be the same as empire either. We might speak of
“cultural imperialism” as a modality of imperial power, but we would not
define empire as a state that only wields cultural influence. 29 Hollywood may
dominate the global film industry, and its values or meanings may indirectly
influence peripheral societies, but if the U.S. government does not meddle in the
affairs of weaker countries and aim to control their affairs, the United States
would not be an empire in our strict sense of the term.

Kennedy (1987: 539) defines “great powers” as any “state capable of holding its own against
any other nation,” a status that in turn depends on the states’ relative economic capacities. This
is not the same thing as empires and Kennedy states from the outset that his book is not about
empires (p. xxi).
This definition derives from world-systems theory, see Arrighi, Silver, and Ahmad (1999),
pp. 26–8; Boswell (1995), pp. 2–4; Wallerstein (2002b). There are other ways to define hege-
mony of course, but for this book’s purposes the economic definition will be used.

Empire is analytically distinguishable from great powers, hegemons, and cul-
tural influence, and there is also wide variation across types or forms of empires.
Sociological variations are noteworthy. Typically, empires entail internal diver-
sity, with a dominant group residing at the apex of a sociopolitical hierarchy.
Perhaps the most common hierarchy is racialized: One race monopolizes polit-
ical power to rule over other races who reside in the empire’s subordinated
areas. This is the image typically invoked when one thinks of European colonial
empires in Africa during the late nineteenth century. Yet in our conceptualiza-
tion, an imperial hierarchy need not be racial. It could be ethnic, linguistic, or
religious. In the early modern Spanish empire in the Americas, natives subject
to Spanish rule were not always conceived as racially different and inferior
in the strict phenotypical sense. They were seen as non-Christians, that is,
“pagans.” 30 Difference was marked here as religious rather than as a matter
of biology, blood, or stock. Another example might be the Ottoman empire,
which articulated religion with dynasty such that Islam and the Ottoman family
ruled Kurd or Turk elites. 31 The Tsarist Russian empire was not even ethnically
or religiously differentiated, but class-based. 32
Another variation arises in how political influence is exercised. At stake
here are the forms or modalities of imperial power. One common distinction
is between formal (direct) and informal (or indirect) exercises of power. The
first, formal imperialism, refers to direct territorial rule. The imperial state
annexes foreign land, declares official control over it, and subordinates the local
population. The controlled territory then becomes a colony or dependency. This
dependency is part of the metropolitan state, but its inhabitants do not enjoy
the same rights or privileges as the state’s citizens. Formal empire is thus the
same as colonial empires involving the annexation of territory and direct rule
over it. 33 This type of empire is often, although not exclusively, obtained by
military conquest. During the Roman period, most emperors were victorious
military generals. However, direct formal control can also be established “by
invitation” rather than conquest. 34 Or it can be established by unequal treaties,
as was often the case with early Europeans and Native American tribes. In any
case, this type of direct or colonial empire is usually what most people refer
to when they speak of empire in popular discourse. It conjures the image of
Spain and its colonies in the Americas, France and its possession of Algeria, or
Britain and its rule over India or parts of Africa. Flags are raised. Governors
are appointed. Policies for governing the natives are formulated and exercised.
States are made.
Variations in formal empires follow. We might think of “settler colonial-
ism,” whereby the subordinated colony is dominated by emigrants from the

Patterns of Empire
home land; or “administrative colonialism,” whereby a handful of officials
from the home land rule over large native populations. D. K. Fieldhouse goes
even further, distinguishing between (1) pure settlement colonies (the majority
are settlers from the metropole); (2) mixed colonies (settlers live with a larger
indigenous population); (3) plantation colonies (a small settler group manag-
ing estates for export); (4) occupation colonies (close to no settlers); and (5)
trading settlements or naval bases (small areas of land run by a small group of
temporary metropolitans). 35 We may think of other subtypes too, such as land-
based as opposed to sea-based empires. Or we might order colonial empires
chronologically, attending to differences between early modern empires like
Spain’s or Portugal’s and the modern administrative colonial empires of the
late nineteenth century established by Europe in Africa or parts of Asia. Even
within any single empire, the legal or juridical status of territories and sub-
jects can be variously named and differentially treated, creating a complex of
juridically heterogeneous peripheries.
The overarching point is that formal empires involve direct political control
over territory and the subjugation of inhabitants of that territory into a status
that is lesser, inferior, or dependent. This is the “rule of colonial difference,”
as Partha Chatterjee (1993) has aptly named it. 36 By this measure of colonial
rule, colonized peoples are treated as inferior to citizens in the metropole, both
in practice and in juridical theory or official doctrine. Due to their perceived
racial, ethnic, or some other kind of distinction, the colonized are not given the
same rights and privileges as the colonizer or citizens in the colonizers’ home
country. In some ways, it is exactly this subjugated status that differentiates
colonial empire from pure democratic nation-states or federal states. 37 Nation-
states involve citizens. Empires involve subjects, not citizens, and the difference
between them is an important marker of empire. 38 For Stoler, McGranahan,
and Perdue (2007), it is an essential imperial characteristic: “Uncertain domains
of jurisdiction and ad hoc exemptions from the law on the basis of race and
cultural difference are guiding and defining imperial principles.” 39
Colonialism, as in formal empire, is only one modality of imperial power –
one way of exerting influence over societies. There are others. Robinson and
Gallagher (1953) famously chided British historians for thinking of the British
empire only in terms of its colonies – those parts of the map painted red – when
in fact Britain also exercised influence if not political power over societies
that were not officially colonies. 40 Hence the notion of indirect or “informal”
empire. This refers to the exercise of power over the internal or external affairs

of nominally independent states through a variety of methods falling shy of
annexation. The subordinated periphery in this case does not become a colony
but an informal dependency, weak ally, or client. The imperial state keeps these
nominally independent territories in line or compels them to meet its interests,
but does not declare sovereignty over them. It offers money, protection, access,
or other resources in exchange for deference. It might also employ threats of
force or actually use force. The methods are thus multiple, the tactics nefarious.
They include financial aid or market control, temporary military occupation
or deployments of military power, covert operations to topple recalcitrant
regimes, or just the threat of military assault. 41 The point is that any or all
of these tactics fall short of declarations of sovereignty, even as they facilitate
influence.
Classic and premodern imperial formations show early elements of this sort
of imperial power. Athens exercised informal control over its allies in the Delian
League (478–404 BC). Although nominally independent, the allies were forced
to pay contributions (money and ships) to Athens, and Athens was considered
to be their informal ruler. 42 Similarly, classic patrimonial empires such as the
Egyptian and the Sassanid empires enlisted clients who paid tribute in exchange
for protection; those clients then became part of the empires. 43 The modern era
has also seen informal imperialism. In modern informal imperialism, nations
retain their nominal independence and status as sovereign entities, but a foreign
imperial state exercises power over them through various means short of direct
rule.
We must not be too stark in our distinctions. Formal and informal empire
might be better thought of as two ends of a blurry continuum. In some cases
or at some historical moments, the two might become hardened and rigid
as distinct types, but not always. The point is that empire can take different
forms and have different modalities; and imperial states have a large repertoire
of methods, tactics, and techniques by which to establish, extend, or maintain
themselves. Imperial states might even mix colonial control and informal meth-
ods across different domains, holding an official colony here while establishing
an informal client there. Or they might shift modes, decolonizing a territory
only to replace formal colonialism with informal control.
There could also be distinctions between tactics or techniques cross-cutting
formal or informal modalities. Empires, for instance, might vary in their aggres-
sion. At times they can be more indirect or subtle, whereas at other times they
might be bolder in exerting power. Declaring sovereignty over foreign territory
(i.e., formal imperialism) would be one example of the latter; so, too, would

Informal empire is “a situation in which a single state shapes the behavior of others, whether
directly or indirectly, partially or completely, by means that can range from the outright use of
force through intimidation, dependency, inducement, and even inspiration.” Gaddis quoted in

military invasion. In contrast, financial aid, offering protection, or covert oper-
ations are more subtle and indirect; they are quieter, more silent, or hidden
and thus involve less direct aggression than military invasion. Empires can thus
shift between these modalities or tactics, substituting indirect tactics for direct
ones, or vice-versa. Or they could mix and mingle them in different places,
constituting a complex of strategies dispersed across sites. There are different
ways to be imperial. It may be that this diversity contributes to the flexibility,
and hence persistence, of empire over time and across different contexts.
In any case, we aim to be alert to these differences; to be aware of the
multiplicity of imperial power; and to apprehend them in their possible combi-
nations, shifts, substitutions, or transformations over time. It is for this reason –
and due to this complexity and multiplicity – that we would fare well to think of
empires not as essences but rather as imperial formations: sets of relations and
forms involving multiple tactics, policies, practices, and modalities of power;
hierarchically ordered formations wherein a state or center exercises control or
unequal influence over subordinated territories, peoples, and societies through
a variety of means and methods. 44 In this book, the word empire is used as
shorthand for these complex formations of relations and practices.
The Task Ahead
The preceding discussion offers an admittedly rudimentary conceptual sketch.
Yet it is nonetheless useful as a starting point. For example, with the foregoing
definitions in mind, we might ask where and when political control is estab-
lished and by what means. Formal or informal? We might also ask why formal
control is established rather than informal, or vice-versa. Furthermore, we can
investigate the empire as a whole at any given point in time – its formal terri-
tories and informal clients – and consider how the different parts are related
or not. We might also consider the expansion or contraction of the imperial
formation over time. In other words, we could examine the historical dynamics
of empires, looking at moments when imperialistic activity is extended, stable,
or retracted; or we could probe degrees of boldness and directness over time,
looking for when imperial states become angry aggressors or when they shift to
more subtle puppeteering from behind the scenes. Finally, the foregoing con-
ceptual distinctions enable us to compare empires or imperial formations; to
consider how the preferred strategies and forms are similar or different between
the empires under scrutiny.
The main tasks of this book are guided by these conceptual distinctions and
comparative questions. First, this book focuses foremost on the actions and
operations of the imperial state. Although there are many actors involved in
imperialism – from corporations to settlers, missionaries, and merchants – and
although these actors will be discussed throughout, the primary focus here is
the state: the institutional complex wielding resources deployed to establish

and maintain its formal sovereignty or informal regimes. This follows from
our conceptualization. As noted, empire at base is a matter of political power
exerted by a ruling authority, a state. Therefore, an examination of empires
can and should begin (but not necessarily end) with a focus on the imperial
state. Accordingly, this book explores how the activities of the American state
and British state constitute imperialism or not. It then discloses their imperial
modalities and methods, policies and practices, and tactics and techniques.
Chapters will also explore the activities of each state as they unfolded histori-
cally: how they might have expanded or contracted, how modalities in one era
might have shifted in another, and the overall configuration of imperial power.
This book also puts imperial states into comparative perspective. To be clear,
the comparison is not between British and American hegemony, nor is it about
the United States and Britain as “great powers.” It is not a comparison of how
or why the two nations rose to hegemony; the policies that contributed to their
socioeconomic development; or the factors that made them wealthy military
powers. It is a comparative analysis of imperial formations. It is a comparison
of how and why the two states have (or have not) exercised power over weaker
societies, the forms that that exercise has taken, the modalities by which it
has occurred, and the dynamics of imperialism over time. The comparison
is precisely motivated. Following the implicit methodology of exceptionalist
thought so as to better apprehend exceptionalism’s operations and limits, the
examination aims to illuminate differences and similarities between the two
imperial formations. It looks at the modalities of the American imperial state
in light of the British imperial state and vice-versa. It examines their respective
transformations over time, comparing patterns of emergence, formation, or
re-formation. In short, the comparative goal of this book is to better pinpoint
what has been different about the American empire from the British empire.
The comparison is undoubtedly large. In taking on the task, this book admit-
tedly runs the risk of overlooking certain complexities, details, and nuances.
Multiple studies on these smaller aspects of empires have emerged: studies, for
example, of the minute details of the lives of soldiers or settlers, merchants
and housewives, travelers and slaves. This book does not purport to be of such
caliber. Rather, in the tradition of comparative-historical sociology (and, by
the same token, macrosociology and comparative history), it is unabashedly
aimed at big comparisons. It looks for overarching patterns and dynamics and
underlying forms and features that would otherwise go unnoticed amidst the
trees. It is probably true that “empire is in the details” (as one anthropolo-
gist puts it), but this book ventures the risk that there might be overarching
patterns, modalities, and iterative forms across time and space that warrant
investigation too. 45

lives of everyday actors, see among others Colley (2003a). Much of this work constitutes new

emotions. See for the U.S. context, among others, Stoler (2006), Tyrrell (1991b), and HogansonPatterns of Empire
14
The final goal of this book is to explain whatever patterns we might find.
Rather than only uncovering differences or similarities, this book hopes to
account for them. What explains the fact that the U.S. empire has been this
way or that way, as opposed to the British empire? Why did the U.S. imperial
formation shift in one direction whereas the British formation shifted in the
other? These are the sorts of questions that will be addressed as our analysis
proceeds. We thereby weave between questions of what (What are the differ-
ences or similarities?) and why (Why the differences or similarities?). And on
this matter we return to the issue with which we began: exceptionalism.
Explanation and Exceptionalism
Exceptionalism is relevant for our question of explanation because exception-
alism is more than just a description of the United States. It also has important
implications for analyzing it. One implication is that any comparison between
the United States and other countries is unfounded. As the United States is
exceptional, comparisons to the British empire or any other empire would be
misguided at best, misleading at worst. We would be better off rejecting the
label empire and discarding “false analogies from a distant past.” 46 The other
implication has to do with explanation. As the United States has distinct val-
ues, cultural traditions, and institutions, whatever it does reflects those values,
traditions, and institutions. In other words, America’s exceptional history and
behavior are caused by its exceptional internal characteristics.
This explanatory regime has been embedded in exceptionalist thought since
it was first articulated by Alexis de Tocqueville (and by subsequent writers
like Frederick Jackson Turner). 47 The basic theme is twofold. First, as Ian
Tyrrell clarifies, American history “has been special and unique, standing as
the only example of a true liberal democracy that the rest of the world would
emulate.” 48 Or as Kammen puts it, “the US has had a unique destiny and
history . . . with highly distinctive features or an unusual trajectory.” 49 Second,
these unique features and trajectory have been caused by America’s unique
“national character.” The United States exhibits special “traits” and “liberal,
democratic, individualistic, and egalitarian values,” and these traits or values

Motyl (2006). One historian recently argues that the “empire” label “obfuscates more than it
explains,” for it “asserts a core American similarity with historical empires that overrides too
many fundamental differences.” See Suri (2009), p. 524.
Exceptionalism, as a configuration of thought, has deeper roots. It originates in the discourse
of early American settlers, politicians, and clergy who articulated the tenets of republicanism
with the view that history is the unfolding of God’s millennial plan. After these early stirrings,
exceptionalism emerged as a more or less coherent framework influencing historical thinking
and scholarship. See Ross (1984), pp. 910–11 and Madsen (1998) for good overviews.

account for America’s unique features and trajectory. 50 The United States is
the way it is (exceptional) because it has avoided the “class conflicts, revolu-
tionary upheaval and authoritarian governments of ‘Europe,’” and therefore
has distinct values and beliefs that continue to shape it. 51 Social scientists in
particular have drawn on these ideas to characterize various aspects of Amer-
ican history and explain features of American political development. Just as
some historians claim that “America is a special case in the development of
the West,” so too do political scientists and sociologists insist that “American
political institutions are more open, liberal, and democratic than those of any
other major society,” and that the American state exhibits “particularities as
a liberal state” that cannot be described “as one would describe any other.” 52
These social scientists then call on such particularities to understand such things
as why the United States has been averse to Communism, why it is the richest
country in the world, or why it is more litigious than, say, Canada. 53
Exceptionalism in this sense has implications for thinking about and explain-
ing empire. In exceptionalist narratives, America’s unique values of democ-
racy, liberty, and self-government have led the United States to be a distinc-
tive global power, compelling the American state to behave differently than
European powers: America’s values and democratic institutions have meant
that the United States never constructed an empire. Early expressions on this
theme in the 1950s insisted that the United States eschewed empire because the
United States was itself “a product . . . of revolt against colonial rule.” 54 In the
1970s and 1980s, comparative historians argued that the United States since
World War II has had various opportunities to seize colonies, but “deliber-
ately rejected” the opportunities because the United States has been “obliged
to conform to the principles which are the unalterable foundation of its polit-
ical tradition.” 55 A more recent commentary puts it simply: Empire is “not in
America’s DNA.” 56
In short, exceptionalism is not just a set of historical claims. It is a “way of
talking about American history and culture,” a “form of interpretation with
its own language and logic.” 57 This way of thinking is deeply entrenched in
popular thought. In fact, even some revisionist scholarship critical of exception-
alism runs the risk of reproducing its tenets. As noted, revisionism has examined

Patterns of Empire
and reexamined America’s global ambitions, its territorial and colonial expan-
sion, and various aspects of American foreign policy that disclose imperial
tendencies. 58 Whereas exceptionalism denies empire, this revisionist scholar-
ship shows that empire has been an important feature of American history. Yet
even this revisionist scholarship has not completely escaped exceptionalism’s
assumptions or explanatory models. This might seem odd, considering that the
revisionist historians who inaugurated the study of American empire initially
pitched their work against exceptionalism. Still, it remains the case that excep-
tional thought’s mode of explanation remains a silent shaper of even revisionist
thinking.
We can see this in two variants of revisionism. The first of these, which we
might call “neo-revisionism” (or “liberal exceptionalism”), is seen in commen-
taries that emerged in the wake of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. 59 This sort of revi-
sionism approach admits that there has long been an American empire. “Ever
since the annexation of Texas and invasion of the Philippines,” declares Niall
Ferguson, “the United States has systematically pursued an imperial policy.” 60
But it also insists that American empire has been special. Giving with one
hand while taking from the other, it reinscribes exceptionalism by claiming
that America’s empire has been unique for its liberal and benign character.
Whereas European empires were tyrannical and exploitative, American empire
has been selfless, aiming to promote democracy and liberty around the world.
“America’s imperial goals and modus operandi are much more limited and
benign than were those of age-old emperors.” 61 Whereas European empires
suppressed liberty, rights, and democracy, America’s empire has been aimed
at spreading them. “American imperialists usually moved much more quickly
than their European counterparts to transfer power to democratically elected
local rulers – as they are attempting to do in Iraq.” 62 Traditional exceptional-
ism represses the word “empire,” but this variant of revisionism just proclaims
a distinctly American imperialism that ostensibly manifests America’s special
virtues.
The second variant of revisionism, which might be called “critical revision-
ism,” comes initially from the founding historiography of William A. Williams
and harkens back to leftist critiques of imperialism. This approach also insists
that the United States has been an empire, but it does not see the American
empire as uniquely benign. Rather than praising American empire for its lib-
eral character, it portrays empire as a dangerous exploitative force. How, then,
does this critical revisionism reinscribe exceptionalist thought?

The reinscription involves two steps. The first is to pinpoint American
empire’s particularity by saying it has taken on a special form. American
empire, in this view, has been indirect and less territorial than other empires.
This constitutes a special “American way of empire” that is different from
other ways of empire, a unique American brand of informal imperialism. The
American empire has been distinct from European empires for its noncolonial
character, employing nefarious economic or political means falling short of
annexation to manipulate other societies. The second move is to then explain
this difference (and a host of related ones) by reference to classic exceptionalist
themes. If the U.S. empire has been informal rather than colonial, this is because
of America’s uniquely democratic traditions, beliefs, and values that militate
against direct colonial rule and usurpations of sovereignty. Economic exploita-
tion or resource extraction is acceptable, but colonialism is not. As one political
scientist argues, the “political ethos and structure of the United States inher-
ently militated against any doctrine other than that of national self-government
for foreign peoples. . . . Among the Western democracies, the disinterest in for-
eign rule, and hence the prejudice in favor of the self-government of others,
has been particularly pronounced in the United States.” 63 The astute historian
Anthony Pagden likewise asserts that colonialism “has never been an option
for the United States.” In order for the United States to be a colonial empire,
“as even the British were at the end of the nineteenth century, the United
States would have to change radically the nature of its political culture.” 64
Others suggest that America has engaged in informal noncolonial imperialism
because of its unique “social system,” which has no natural “ruling class.” 65
Tocqueville’s reckonings here resound in revisionist reinscriptions of imperial
exceptionalism.
So both neo-revisionism/liberal exceptionalism and critical revisionism
would answer our comparative questions with neo-exceptionalist answers. Has
the United States been an empire? Yes, but it has been a different empire than
others. Why has the American empire been different? Because of America’s
special national character, institutions, or political culture.
But if revisionists already have an answer to our comparative questions, what
is at stake in this book? Why bother with a comparative analysis? The problem
is that the revisionist answers (and exceptionalist ones) remain hypotheses at
best. To claim that anything is exceptional about the American empire depends
on clarifying the “rule” against which the empire is measured; yet too often
the rule is presumed rather than examined. Sustained comparative studies are
few and far between. Hence, as long as our claims about what is distinct
about the U.S. empire are not put into comparative relief, they remain tentative
assertions subject to falsification through systematic comparison. We have
already seen how a look at Britons’ discourse of empire in the mid-nineteenth

century reveals that the uniqueness of American empire cannot lie in the fact
that Americans deny it. And if the specificity of the American empire does not
lie in its self-denial, does it actually lie in its so-called reluctance or hesitance
to colonize foreign land? Does it lie in the way it exerts power? Furthermore,
if there are such differences, can they really be attributable to an exceptional
or unique “national character” or special liberal-democratic “values”? Only a
comparative investigation can properly answer these questions.
In short, exceptionalism and some brands of revisionism provide one per-
spective for specifying what is unique about the American empire and for
explaining that uniqueness. But they do not validate their claims through com-
parison. Take an example. As noted, one revisionist argument is that the United
States’ empire has been distinct because, unlike Britain’s empire, it has been
informal and noncolonial. Presumably, this is due to America’s egalitarian
social structure and political culture. Because the United States lacks an aristo-
cratic class predisposed to governing from afar, and because its democratically
minded populace has supported the principle of self-determination around the
world, the American state has been constrained to exert power over other
societies in noncolonial, informal ways. 66 So what is wrong with such an argu-
ment? On its face, nothing. It is the case, for instance, that America has not
had the same sort of aristocratic class as England. Yet merely pointing out this
difference is not sufficient for validating the causal argument that the lack of an
aristocratic class leads to a noncolonial strategy. We would have to trace the
causal chain connecting the absence of the class to the absence of colonialism.
Furthermore, one could think of various reasons for why a state adopts one
imperial strategy rather than another. The presence or absence of an aristo-
cratic governing class would constitute only one possible explanation among
a range of alternative explanations. So we would need to consider alternative
explanations too.
To be sure, alternative explanations can be formulated. For example, some
studies of the British empire have shown that much of what the British empire
did and the forms it took had to do with conditions in the periphery rather than
in the metropole. 67 Similarly, some versions of international relations theory
explain what states do by reference to the international system, not to the
states’ internal culture. Mandlebaum’s classic study of states’ security policy
shows that variations between different states’ security policies are “created
by variations of the international system itself,” such that “two states that
are similarly situated in the system but have different domestic orders will
tend to pursue similar security policies.” 68 Both of these approaches offer

different takes on empire than exceptionalism or even revisionism. Rather than
explaining what a state does or what type of empire it is by reference to
characteristics intrinsic to the state itself, these approaches invite analysts to
consider the characteristics of the periphery or the wider geopolitical field in
which the state is embedded. Existing assertions of American exceptionalism do
not consider these alternative possible explanations. Therefore, the argument
that the American empire’s distinctiveness is due to national traits or character
remains open to justifiable questioning. Further investigation is necessary.
Comparing Empires
The comparative investigation in this book aims to overcome these explanatory
limitations of existing scholarship. By adopting a comparative approach, it
aims to pinpoint similarities and differences between the two empires. It then
examines possible explanations for the variations and assesses them against the
weight of evidence. But why use Britain as the key point of comparison? And
exactly how should the comparison be conducted?
The British empire is particularly useful. First, popular discourse has often
conjured the British empire as providing “lessons” for American empire.
This is typical of the recent neoconservative discourse on American empire.
“Afghanistan and other troubled lands today,” wrote Max Boot in 2003, “cry
out for the sort of enlightened foreign administration once provided by self-
confident Englishmen in jodhpurs and pith helmets.” But the comparisons in
popular discourse reach further back. In 1965, an essay in the New York Times
asked: “Is America an empire? It is a question which no American cares to ask
himself and, if you ask it of him, he returns a hasty negative. ‘Imperialism is
not in our blood. You are still thinking in terms of the British Empire.’” 69
As popular discourse already thinks of Britain as the key reference point, a
systematic comparison enables us to better assess these passing comparative
claims.
The second reason for using Britain is that it provides a critical entry into the
exceptionalism-revisionist debate and its various assertions. Britain is typically
used in these debates as a comparative reference point (even if the comparison
is usually made in passing reference). More specifically, the case of Britain is
implicitly or explicitly invoked to validate cultural values or “national charac-
ter” as the primary explanation. Britain’s monarchical tradition and its aristo-
cratic values are taken as a counterpoint to America’s liberal-democratic and
more egalitarian character. Comparison with Britain therefore shows Amer-
ica’s exceptionalism. The logic is as follows: (1) Britain has different cultural
values, political institutions, and traditions than the United States; (2) Britain
(ostensibly) constructed an empire whereas the United States did not (or, in the

(2006).

Patterns of Empire
revisionist variant, the United States constructed a different type of empire);
therefore (3) what makes the American empire (or lack thereof) different
from Britain are America’s exceptional cultural values, institutions, and tra-
ditions. These implicit comparisons warrant explicit consideration, which is
why Britain is analytically useful here. 70
The final reason for using Britain as a comparative case to the United States
has to do with similarities between the two countries rather than differences.
Although Britain and the United States have different cultural values and tradi-
tions, they share the fact that, of all states in the past centuries, only they have
been hegemonic. As noted earlier, hegemony is an economic category to refer
to a state’s relative preponderance over the world economy. During the history
of modern capitalism, only the United States and Britain undisputedly fit this
category. Britain dominated the world economy in the mid-nineteenth century.
It was the banker, baker, and workshop of the world, taking up the largest
share of world GDP. The United States in the mid-twentieth century, after the
Second World War, then occupied this niche. Of course, their two hegemonies
are not exactly the same. There are differences in relative military capacity,
economic policies, or the bases of their economic dominance. Yet none of this
negates the fact that, when we use measures that scholars use to assess relative
economic power in the world, only the United States and Britain have been
hegemonic. 71 This similarity is important for adjudicating causal arguments.
Working from such similarities, a controlled paired comparison is possible. As
political scientist Sidney Tarrow explains, by beginning the comparison with
“common foundations,” we are less likely to overlook unseen variables that
might better explain the outcome under consideration. 72
To better understand this, consider if we compared the actions of one state
with another state. Let’s assume that the two states have different “national
characters” or cultural values. Let’s also say that we happen to find that the
states carried out very different imperial strategies. With this sort of compar-
ative method, we might conclude that the difference in imperial strategies can
be explained by the different cultural traditions. But consider if the two states
differed not just in their cultural values, but also in, say, their hegemonic status:
State A dominated the world economy whereas State B did not. If this were the
case, it might be that the difference in imperial strategy was not due to cultural
difference, but rather to the difference in hegemonic status. Without holding
hegemonic status constant – or “controlling” for it, to use social science par-
lance – it would be more difficult to assess which was the more important

For recent calls to more systematically compare the U.S. empire with the British empire, among
others, see Hopkins (2007). For a good overview comparison, see Howe (2003).
For the most systematic assessments of economic dominance using statistical measures, see
Maddison (2001) and Chase-Dunn, Jorgenson, Reifer, and Lio (2005). There have been debates
about whether the United States or England have really been hegemonic (see, for example,
Strange (1987), Martel (1991), and Schroeder (1994)). But these debates turn on a much
broader definition of “hegemony” than the strict economic one used here.

explanatory factor, culture or hegemonic status. We would not, in short, be
able to validate or invalidate our claim that culture was the driving cause of
imperialism.
This comparative fallacy underwrites many of the claims made in excep-
tionalist historiography and social science. For example, one of the ways in
which claims about American exceptionalism have been sustained has been by
comparing America’s post–World War II foreign policy with Britain’s imperi-
alism of the late nineteenth century. By this comparison, we might find that
the United States did not acquire colonies, whereas Britain in the late nine-
teenth century did, such as when it took part in the “scramble for Africa.”
This comparison could then be taken as evidence for an essential American
anti-imperial character: The United States did not take new colonies because
of its deeply democratic and liberal values. However, the problem here is with
the time periods under comparison. Specifically, comparing America’s lack of
colonial annexations after World War II with Britain’s colonial expansion in
the late nineteenth century overlooks the very different situations of the two
states. In the late nineteenth century, Britain was experiencing new economic
competition after enjoying decades of dominance in the world economy. Eco-
nomic competitors, such as Germany and the United States, were on the rise.
This competition might have motivated Britain to seize new colonies. Acquiring
new territory might have been an attempt to regain some economic power or,
at the very least, prevent rivals from acquiring territory and thereby help thwart
the rivals’ competitiveness. The context for the United States after World War
II, however, was very different. The United States dominated the world econ-
omy and faced very little if no economic competition whatsoever. It was in
a hegemonic position. This position, not inherent national values or virtues,
could plausibly help explain why the United States did not seize new colonies
whereas Britain did. Unlike Britain, the United States dominated the world
economy and did not face serious economic rivals. It had less of a need for
overseas colonies.
This is not to say that the reason for the difference was in fact economic need.
The point is that, by comparing Britain’s and America’s imperial activities at
time periods when the two were differentially positioned in the world economy,
we cannot rule out this alternative explanation. And without ruling out this
alternative explanation, the exceptionalist explanation is open to serious ques-
tion. It would be more persuasive to compare American and British actions in
respectively similar historical phases so as to enable some rough controls over
possibly confounding explanatory factors (like economic competition and/or
hegemonic status).
Accordingly, the method in this book is not just to compare the British
and American empires, but also to compare them across comparable his-
torical phases. As both Britain and the United States have been hegemonic,
they also experienced similar historical phases, and each of these phases has
entailed other similarities. First, both Britain and the United States underwent
a period of hegemonic ascendancy before they respectively reached hegemonicPatterns of Empire

The long ascent is the entire period before the state has reached
hegemonic maturity; the short ascent refers to the period within
the long ascent when the global system is “multipolar” (i.e.,
there is no clear hegemon and rivals are battling for hegemony);
this period is the same as the “competition/decline” phase.

(1984); Wallerstein (2002b); Wallerstein (1974).
maturity. Britain underwent this phase, roughly, from 1688 to 1815 (and more
precisely from 1763 to 1815), and the United States did so from 1776 to 1945
(or from 1873 to 1945). This means that both, although at different times,
were similarly positioned in the world system relative to other states. It also
means that they shared other characteristics, such as the fact that they were
both expanding their economies and internal state capacities. Second, both
Britain and the United States then achieved hegemonic maturity: Britain from
1815 to 1873 and the United States from 1946 to 1973. In these periods,
each state dominated the world’s productive capacities (taking up the great-
est shares of world GDP). Each also took up the greatest share of military
capacities while enjoying relative economic prosperity at home. Finally, both
states have experienced hegemonic decline: Britain from 1873 to 1939, and the
United States from 1974 to the present. This means that both states experienced
new economic competition from rivals that they had not experienced during
their respective periods of hegemonic maturity. These were also periods, then,
when the global system entered a new multipolar or competitive phase (see
Table I.1). 73
By comparing American and British imperial activities during these respec-
tive phases, our paired comparison is fulfilled at each step in the analysis.
Because hegemony is not defined by imperialism but by relative economic posi-
tion in the world, the analysis is not circular. Hegemony and empire are not
73
The dividing line dates typically refer to either world wars, which can be seen as the apex of
decline/ascent, or economic events that set off a new economic cycle. The periodization has been
worked out by world-systems scholars. See Boswell (2004); Chase-Dunn, Jorgenson, Reifer, and
Lio (2005); Wallerstein (1984), Wallerstein (2002b), Wallerstein (1974). The periodization
is open to some dispute, but the world-systems literature convincingly demonstrates that if
we follow our strict definition of hegemony as preponderance over the world economy, the
periodization roughly holds. Other periodizations are available, but these are based on different
definitions of hegemony. See, for example, Modelski (1978), Modelski and Thompson (1996).Introduction

the same thing; hence we can use the former to ground our comparisons of
the latter. This, then, is not to presume that hegemonic phase actually deter-
mines imperial actions. It is merely to allow for a controlled comparison to
better assess which possible factors might explain imperial actions. The point
is to be more methodologically conscious about our comparisons and therefore
maximize the validity of our claims.
There are obvious limitations to our method. The first is the “small-N”
problem. This means that not all explanations can be properly tested. We
would need additional cases beyond the United States and Britain in order
to adjudicate more explanations. The second problem is that world develop-
ments might confound our attempt to control for variation. As we will see, for
instance, the global context during America’s period of hegemonic maturity
(roughly 1946–1970s) was not exactly the same as the global context when
Britain was hegemonic (in the mid-nineteenth century). The world system had
itself changed, and this is a factor that must be considered when comparing the
two states during those time periods. The final problem is that the comparison
depends on analytically separating the two empires from each other when, in
reality, they were not separated. When the United States was undergoing hege-
monic ascent in the early twentieth century, Britain was undergoing hegemonic
decline, and we cannot presume that the two processes were disconnected.
In fact, as we will see, the U.S. empire made good use of Britain’s existing
empire to realize some of its ends. The two empires were often intertwined and
entangled.
Despite these problems, this book stakes the claim that the comparative
approach is still worthwhile. First, there is no doubt that the small-N prob-
lem is an endemic weakness of paired comparison. However, this weakness is
exchanged for strength on other counts. Comparing many empires rather than
just two may help overcome the small-N problem, but makes it more difficult
to conduct a detailed concrete analysis. A very wide lens allows one to see
more than a small lens, but not always as clearly. Therefore, although com-
paring Britain and the United States alone has its limitations, it also enables
our study “to combine analytical leverage with in-depth knowledge.” 74 Fur-
thermore, even this small-N problem can be compensated for by examining
not only the two empires at comparable historical phases, but also by bringing
in their other historical phases as comparative reference points. For example,
we can compare the United States and Britain during their respective periods
of hegemonic maturity, and we can also bring into the comparison an analysis
of the two states during their other historical periods, such as their respective
periods of hegemonic ascent. This expands the comparative cases by comparing
across empires and across time.
Second, whereas restricting our comparison to specific historical phases
between the two states cannot control for world developments across the time
periods, we can at least control for some possibly confounding factors where
74

24
we would otherwise not be able to. One is economic capacity. States undergo-
ing the hegemonic maturity phase have more economic resources than when
they are undergoing the ascendancy phase, which would in turn give the state
more resources. This was indeed the case for both Britain and the United States,
as we will see. Therefore, by comparing the two states during their respective
stages of hegemonic ascendancy, we can control not just for relative position in
the world economy, but also the factor of state capacity. In short, although no
comparative method would be perfect, our approach offers one way – hitherto
underutilized – to better explain whatever variations or similarities in imperial
dynamics or forms that we might find.
There is a final value to tracking and comparing imperial activity by hege-
monic phase: It offers a systematic way of considering a possible “natural
history” of hegemonic empires. As hegemons rise, mature, and decline, what
types of imperial activity do they engage in? Are there differences in their impe-
rial practices or modalities depending on phase? And across the two hegemons
analyzed here (Britain and the United States), are there common patterns of
imperial activity in conjunction with hegemonic phase? Or are there funda-
mental differences in their imperial careers? Using hegemonic phases as a guide
facilitates a properly historical analysis that considers sequence and process.
This is a critical issue for analyzing empires in general. Any analysis of empires
must take history seriously, in the sense that we must not presume a singular
entity – for example, the British empire – that remains constant or unchanged
over time. 75 Using hegemonic phases as an analytic guide focuses our attention
on imperial formations in history – that is, multifaceted entities of power in the
process of formation or reformation, disarticulation or dissolution, expansion,
stability, or contraction. Whether or not such imperial processes correspond to
hegemonic phases is one question we will want to consider.
What Lies Ahead
The book is organized in loose chronological and comparative fashion. Chap-
ters proceed by comparing British and American imperial activities during
their comparable phases of global power (ascent, maturity, decline) with some
explanatory sections inserted within and between. Chapter 1, “Imperial Paths
to Power,” scrutinizes the two states’ activities during their respective periods
of hegemonic ascent: Britain from 1688 to 1815, and the United States from
1776 to 1945. Both states in these periods were economically ascendant. Both,
too, developed their state capacities. The chapter shows that these similarities
were also concomitant with certain similarities in imperialism that have been
too often overlooked in existing scholarship. As both states developed their
economies and capacities, both also embarked on territorial expansion. They
also crafted similar forms of imperial rule and ideological self-conceptions. In

fact, America’s westward expansion entailed colonial rule over new territo-
ries that were not only similar to but also modeled on the colonial regimes
Britain had previously constructed for the thirteen colonies. The idea of a spe-
cial liberty-loving American empire was first forged amidst this process, but
this had precedents in Britain’s previous settler empire in the Americas. Finally,
the United States constructed an overseas colonial empire around the turn of
the twentieth century – encompassing such places as Puerto Rico, Hawaii, the
Philippines, Guam, Samoa, and the Virgin Islands. This reveals that the United
States has not shied away from formal administrative colonialism.
Some exceptionalist narratives might admit that America’s expansion had
imperialistic characteristics, but they would then insist that American impe-
rialism was fundamentally different from other types of imperialism. Some
exceptionalist commentaries, for instance, acknowledge that the United States
took the Philippines as a colony, but they insist that the way in which the
United States practiced colonialism was unique. Expressed as America’s own
exceptional political culture of democracy, U.S. colonialism in the Philippines
was a benign form of rule, uniquely aimed at teaching Filipinos the ways of
democracy. This renders America’s empire a special empire, unmatched by oth-
ers for its democratizing tendencies. Chapter 2, “Colonial Rules,” tackles this
assertion from the standpoint of comparative colonialisms. Looking at U.S.
colonialism in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, and Samoa and comparing
it with British colonialism in India and Fiji, the comparison unearths more sim-
ilarities with British colonialism than has been disclosed in existing studies. It
also shows that America’s “national character” had little to do with the forms
of rule the United States enacted in its colonies. America’s colonial regimes –
just like Britain’s colonial regimes in Fiji and India – reflected local conditions
rather than national values or metropolitan political institutions. This chap-
ter thereby offers a theory of colonial forms, suggesting that colonial policies
and institutions are determined not by the characteristics or character of the
colonizer but by the complexities and contingencies of the colonial situation.
Chapter 3, “Hegemonies and Empires,” compares the two imperial for-
mations during their respective phases of hegemonic maturity: Britain from
1815 to 1873 and the United States from 1946 to 1973. The chapter shows
that whereas the period of ascent was marked by relatively constant territo-
rial expansion, the period of hegemonic maturity was marked by a relative
contraction. After the United States seized the former Japanese-mandated ter-
ritories in the aftermath of World War II, its territorial expansion halted.
After the Napoleonic Wars, Britain’s expansion similarly slowed. Direct con-
trol over territory became less prominent, and instead informal exercises of
power took precedence. Both states preferred indirect nonterritorial rule over
peripheral areas, creating empires of clients and subordinated allies. Attendant
with both imperial formations, too, were a discourse and partial realization of
open trading policies over and against the mercantilism of previous years. The
enlargement of commercial space along with informal networks of impe-
rial power thus trumped formal territorial domination. Sporadic military26
Patterns of Empire
interventions, the establishment of military outposts, and clientelistic relations
with weaker states became the preferred tactics of imperial power.
Whereas previous chapters disclose fundamental similarities across the
empires during their respective periods of hegemonic ascent and maturity,
Chapter 4, “Imperial Forms, Global Fields,” addresses one glaring difference
between the U.S. and British empires. That is, whereas Britain mixed both
formal and informal imperialism during its period of hegemonic maturity, the
United States relied primarily on the informal mode of imperialism after taking
the Japanese territories in the wake of World War II. During their respective
periods of hegemony, both Britain and the United States preferred informal
empire, but Britain nonetheless added some territorial holdings amidst its pur-
suit of informal empire whereas the American state did not. This remains a
crucial difference that some existing commentaries have seized upon to show
how the United States has been exceptional. The United States, it has been
claimed, did not seize colonies after World War II because of its liberal demo-
cratic character. However, as we will see in this chapter, the reason why the
United States did not in fact expand its territorial holdings had little to do
with its exceptional political culture. Instead it had to do with the character
of the global field after World War II that differed significantly from the field
Britain engaged during its comparable period of hegemony. Whereas Britain
faced an open field ripe for colonization, the United States faced a global field
populated by allied empires and rising anticolonial nationalism. Only because
of these features of the field, not because of America’s national character, did
the United States turn away from formal territorial rule.
Chapter 5, “Weary Titans: Declining Powers, New Imperialisms,” brings us
closer to the current era. It compares Britain’s and America’s imperial activ-
ities amidst their respective periods of hegemonic decline. These are periods
when each state, although previously enjoying unqualified dominance over the
world economy, faced unprecedented competitors (Britain circa 1873–1939;
the United States circa 1973–present). The chapter shows that as both states
experienced decline, so too did they intensify and/or extend their imperialistic
activity compared with the previous period of hegemony. Both states, in short,
embarked on new imperialisms, apparently replaying the imperial follies of
their youth. For Britain, this was manifest primarily in its expansion of formal
empire; for the United States, it was manifest in a range of new military inter-
ventions and temporary occupations (the assaults on Iraq in 1991 and 2003
were only tips of the iceberg: There were other deployments and occupations).
Finally, this chapter reveals why both states embarked on new imperialisms
during their respective periods of economic decline. The chapter will reveal
that similarities between the states’ imperialistic activities amidst decline are
not coincidental but lie in deeper structural forces.
Chapter 6, “The Dynamics of Imperialism,” takes a longer view of the two
empires. Previous chapters examined specific phases in each imperial state’s
career, but this chapter puts them all together. It reveals that both empires fol-
lowed similar historical dynamics over the long durée. Specifically, they eachIntroduction
27
followed a pattern of expansion, abatement, and reassertion constituting dis-
tinct waves of imperial aggression. The “new imperialism,” in other words,
was only one phase in a larger dynamic. The chapter then explains the pattern.
It shows that the pattern is best understood by considering global competition.
The overarching point is not different from the point of other chapters: In
order to understand the two imperial formations, their practices and policies,
and modalities and methods, we are better off eschewing exceptionalist expla-
nations that focus on national character and instead consider wider fields of
interaction and struggle.
Ultimately, this book compares the U.S. and British empires and interrogates
the exceptionalist thesis, but it also carries larger lessons. In particular, it allows
us to arrive at a larger theory of empires. The theory is simple enough, but it
could be too easily ignored in both scholarship and popular discourse. And its
implications are important. That is: Empires, rather than omnipotent powers
that easily make and remake their subjects and spaces, and rather than entities
shaped from within, must be understood as adaptive dynamic entities that are
shaped and reshaped by foreign societies as much as they strive to control them.
Empires are defined by power, but the modalities of power are crafted, limited,
formed, and re-formed through the very relations power seeks to harness. This
banality of imperial power, as we will see, is a far cry from exceptionalist
portrayals of American empire.1

ideas, instincts, motives, and modes of thought as their fellow-kinsmen in the Old
World.

Expansion has ever been the instinct of the United States. The very symbol of the
Union is an Eagle and the Eagle is a bird that spreads its wings. . . . Compared
with the Eagle the British Lion treads mother earth like a tortoise. And no Eagle
has ever flown further afield than the American Eagle.

When the average American thinks of “colonialism”, or of the Colonial Powers, he
is apt to confine his thoughts to European “colonialism”. . . . Not many Americans
stop to think that Puerto Rico was conquered from Spain (as the British captured
Jamaica); that the Virgin Islands were bought from Denmark . . . that Alaska was
bought from Russia and Louisiana from the French in the same way; that the
Panama Canal Zone was acquired in the twentieth century by methods which
would have been condemned if indulged by a European Power at a much earlier
period.

The so-called long eighteenth century from 1688 to 1815 was a formative
period for Britain. Up to that point, Britain had been a small island monarchy,
a minor player on the European scene. The Glorious Revolution in 1688, how-
ever, marked a new era. After establishing representative government, the little

island slowly shored up its military strength and became increasingly involved
in interstate affairs. It defeated its enemies and grew in strength. It expanded
its domestic economy and partook of a widening world economic system. It
outproduced and outsold its rivals and built its economic infrastructure. By
the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Britain emerged as the world’s pre-
eminent power. It became a global hegemon, a foe to be feared or a friend
to be flattered. Later, the United States followed a similar path. It began as
a comparably small series of settlements on the east coast of North America.
After World War II, it became the world’s new economic mammoth, taking up
the role that Britain had held previously. As the years 1688–1815 for Britain
marked the path toward world power, so did the years 1776–1945 for the
United States.
Scholars have noted these similar paths. But what about the imperial dimen-
sions of Britain’s and America’s respective ascendancies? For Britain the answer
might seem obvious. It is well established that Britain’s rise to world hegemony
was accompanied by the construction of a massive overseas empire. As his-
torian P. J. Marshall notes, the years 1689–1815 marked an important phase
in British imperial expansion: “By 1815 Britain’s global trade totally eclipsed
that of her European rivals and she was the possessor of the only Empire of
any consequence.” 5 For the United States, however, the imperial issue is more
opaque. Was America’s long rise to global hegemony over the nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries also attended by imperialism and the construction
of an “empire”? If so, exactly how similar or different was it from Britain’s
imperialism in the long eighteenth century?
At first glance, a comparison between Britain in the long eighteenth cen-
tury and the United States in the nineteenth century would not seem tenable.
These histories transpired in very different times and worlds. But the similari-
ties merit attention. First, these were times when the relative capacities of the
two states were similar. Both states were still rising to world power, engaging in
regional interstate affairs while building their economies, and both ended their
respective periods by attaining global hegemony. Second, both states began
their ascendancies with similar political characteristics. Both were compara-
bly weak, decentralized polities compared to the stronger, more authoritarian
states on the European continent. Both were initially averse to the idea of strong
armies controlled by a monarch or executive power, and both lacked powerful
centralized bureaucracies. 6 These similarities are notable in themselves. The
question explored here is whether they also entailed similarities in imperial
practices or forms.
This chapter begins by sketching the processes and dynamics of British and
U.S. state territorial expansion during their respective periods of ascent. State

territorial expansion is different from the expansion of nonstate entities or
social groups like settlers, capitalists, or corporations. It refers to the acquisi-
tion and incorporation of new territory by a state such that the new territory
becomes subject to that state’s sovereignty. This type of expansion cuts to the
heart of “empire” as we have defined it in this book. There can be no empire
without the exercise of power over a territory, and in this case, no formal empire
without a state that annexes territory to rule it. When considering questions of
empire, we should first look at state territory.
Although an examination of state territorial expansion is the necessary
first step toward considering the imperial dimensions of the two states’ pre-
hegemonic histories, it is only the beginning. Territorial expansion is a precon-
dition for empire but does not in itself constitute it. Territories can be acquired,
but whether they end up as subordinate units of an imperial formation or as
equal polities within a nation is another matter entirely. The former is empire
building; the latter is nation building. Therefore, after sketching the dynam-
ics and logics of territorial expansion, this chapter considers whether the two
states’ respective territorial expansions might qualify as imperial expansions
and, if so, exactly how.
Comparative Expansions
Dynamics of British Expansion, 1688–1815
The diplomat and poet Mathew Prior returned to Britain from Paris in 1699.
In December of that year, he gave one of his most elaborate odes, the “Car-
men Seculare for the year 1700.” Through forty-two stanzas, he praised King
William III, extolling him as Britain’s savior who would perpetuate Britain’s
glories around the world. Britain was bound to “calm the earth, and vindicate
the sea.” He continued:
Our prayers are heard, our master’s fleets shall go
As far as winds can bear, or waters flow,
New lands to make, new Indies to explore,
In worlds unknown to plant Britannia’s power. 7
Britain had only emerged from the Glorious Revolution a couple of decades
earlier. Yet the homage was a portent. Over the course of the long eighteenth
century, Britain indeed pushed as far as winds could bear, expanding out-
ward to take new foreign land abroad. Of course, Britain had already taken
steps beyond its shores before Prior’s homage. Explorers and enterprisers had
established small outposts on the eastern seaboard of North America, land-
ing on points in Newfoundland, Massachusetts, and Virginia. Backed by royal
companies seeking tobacco and cod, these outposts had populations of about
260,000 by the early eighteenth century. 8 In the 1650s, other enterprises were

established in Barbados, the Leeward Islands, and Jamaica; they would become
vital for tobacco, sugar, and the slave trade. The British East India Company
had also taken some path-breaking steps. A nominally private company under
the English monarch’s charter, it had established a foothold in small spots of
Mughal India.
This earlier period of expansion was seminal: It “laid down the pattern for
all that was to come.” 9 But the subsequent territorial expansion through the
long eighteenth century remains important. This period saw new developments
on various registers, all of which were part and parcel of Britain’s rise to global
hegemony. For the purposes of our comparison, these developments warrant
attention.
The first development was territorial growth. British agents, explorers, and
settlers moved far beyond England’s initial settlements and scattered outposts.
The growth came in two distinct phases, with the Seven Years’ War (1756–
1763) serving as a sort of watershed (see Figure 1.1). The first phase, from 1688
to the 1750s, saw new acquisitions at a relatively slow rate, largely in the Amer-
icas. In the north, Britain acquired Acadia (Nova Scotia) and Newfoundland,
and it consolidated early settlements in Georgia. In the Caribbean, Britain made
the Bahamas (initially settled in 1647) a Crown Colony in 1718 and took the
Mosquito Coast in 1740. The second phase saw continued territorial growth
9

Patterns of Empire
in the Americas (Britain added the Windward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago,
St. Lucia, and British Guiana, among others) but differed in other respects.
Foremost, the growth occurred at a faster rate, and there was a new geograph-
ical orientation: The East India Company became more deeply entrenched in
India and moved outward; explorers paved the way for trading ports in West-
ern Africa; Captain Arthur Phillip led a settlement in New South Wales; and
enterprisers set up a small settlement in Penang. 10
The second development was emigration and population growth. By 1750,
the white population of the North American colonies had reached 1.2 million. 11
The number of persons in the North American colonies and the West Indies
together grew from 412,000 in 1700 to 2,762,000 by 1771. Meanwhile,
Britain’s population in 1771 was 6,448,000. 12 Additionally, by 1811, there
were some 10,000 British subjects living in New South Wales, with a further
1,500 in Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania). 13 This growth abroad was matched,
if not propelled, by population growth at home. The population of Britain
nearly trebled from 1550 to 1820, whereas at the same time France’s popula-
tion grew only by about 79 percent. 14
The third development had to do with the character of expansion. During
the seventeenth century, overseas expansion had been driven by explorers, set-
tlers, or merchants. The Crown sometimes sanctioned these initiatives but did
not play an active role. However, as the eighteenth century progressed, “gov-
ernment rather than the subject was responsible for extending the empire.” 15
For one thing, the British state negotiated the acquisition of colonies from rivals
and articulated how the territories fit into wider strategic and economic goals.
By enacting the Navigation Acts, along with other measures to eliminate com-
petition from rival powers, it signaled that the economics of the territories were
to be subordinated to the state’s economic plans. For another, the state took
administrative charge from chartered companies and increasingly intervened
in territorial affairs overseas. Parliament revoked or modified early royal char-
ters to give London more direct control. Beginning in the 1740s, the Crown
increasingly vetoed laws passed by colonial legislatures. The Board of Trade,
at this time in charge of most colonial matters, tried to increase the powers

On this growth, see Marshall (1998), p. 1–2 and Bayly (1998). Since Harlow (1952), it has
been typical to speak of a “first” and “second” British empire, with the latter referring to a
new geographical orientation toward Asia. The division must not be exaggerated; even after
the American Revolution, Britain maintained a presence in the Caribbean and small American
possessions, and before 1763, the British East India Company had probed parts of Asia. But it
is true that Britain reached to Asia in new ways by the late 1700s.

native inhabitants. Between 1600 and 1750, the natives of New England probably lost close to
ten thousand people resulting from wars with colonists. Historians have estimated a death rate
from exposure to alien diseases of about 75 percent. See Merrell (1991), p. 122.

of the London-appointed colonial governors over their respective jurisdictions
and local legislatures. Not all of these assertions of authority were successful
(as we will see later), but they nonetheless represented the metropolitan state’s
increased role in colonial governance. Whereas the state had been “slender and
enabling rather than interventionist,” it now centralized administration and
began to form “a coherent, London-directed British Empire in America.” 16
In addition to taking and administering territories, the British state took
increasing charge of colonial trade, security, and defense. Throughout the first
half of the eighteenth century, it constructed a “maritime-imperial system”
whereby London could promote and protect the commercial activities of pri-
vate interests in the New World in exchange for loyalty and customs revenues.
Whereas it had not before, it sent naval squadrons to the Caribbean to help pro-
tect commerce and suppress piracy. 17 The British state became active on land as
well. Parliament set up new administrative agencies in North America for pro-
tecting frontiers against Native Americans and for handling native affairs. In
the early 1700s, provincial governors in North America had been in charge of
Indian diplomatic matters, but in the 1750s London created its own regional
superintendents directly responsible to Whitehall. 18 Fittingly, total expenses
of the British home government for army, navy, colonial administration, and
other minor activities in North America increased fourfold during the period
from 1740 to 1775. 19
This increasing state involvement was part of a larger transformation in the
British state itself. Prior to the long eighteenth century, Britain’s engagement
with Europe had been relatively limited and sporadic. But during the 1700s, it
became increasingly enmeshed in European affairs. Between 1680 and 1780,
Britain fought four major wars with European powers and engaged in a slew of
smaller conflicts and military deployments. 20 In turn, these unprecedented for-
eign entanglements demanded military power and new domestic fiscal arrange-
ments to cultivate it. Accordingly, there was a twofold development in British
state formation in this period. On the one hand, Britain’s domestic state capac-
ities were comparably weak. After 1688, “the powers of central government
were devolved on the localities and diluted by a spoils system which pro-
vided income and office for the scions of the landed classes.” 21 On the other
hand, the British state’s external capacities were enhanced. Even as the British
state’s “despotic” power at home was weak, its power for engagements abroad
grew, leading to a strong “fiscal-military state.” As historian John Brewer’s
seminal work shows, the military became “the most important single factor in

the domestic economy: the largest borrower and spender, as well as the largest
single employer. Public spending, fuelled by military costs, rose by leaps and
bounds. The civilian administration supporting the military effort burgeoned;
taxes and debts increased. Britain acquired a standing army and navy. She
became, like her main rivals, a fiscal-military state, one dominated by the task
of waging war.” 22 Military spending thus grew some 450 percent between the
1720s and the 1820s (see Figure 1.2). 23
Britain’s territorial expansion was inextricably entangled with these devel-
opments. Interstate war in the European theater meant that the New World
became a site of engagement. During the Nine Years’ War, the French tried to
divert Britain’s resources from Europe by attacking Britain’s New England and
22
23

The trend is partly attributable to the overall growth in state spending in the period, but military
spending still took a disproportionate share over civil government spending and debt spending.
This was the case even during peacetime, when military spending was between three to four
times greater than spending on civil government. See Harling and Mandler (1993), p. 49; see
also Brewer (1989), p. 30; O’Brien (1988b).Imperial Paths to Power, 1688–1939

New York territories; this led to various battles that deployed Indian allies. 24
During the War of Spanish Succession, the British state feared that a Bourbon
prince on the Spanish throne would enable the French to dominate the Spanish
Indies, which would in turn threaten Britain’s holdings and trade. In response,
Britain sent fleets to the West Indies and engaged in yet more battles in North
America (where the War of Spanish Succession was better known as Queen
Anne’s War). 25 Territorial expansion needed a more powerful state to protect
the new territorial network.
The final development in imperial matters over the long eighteenth century
had to do with identity and ideology: The term empire became increasingly
part of the vocabulary and also took on new meanings. Before the mid-1700s,
the vast collection of overseas colonies, plantations, or dominions were not
typically unified under the category “British empire.” The term rather signified
the Crown’s power as distinct from the authority of any external power (it
thus maintained the original Latin meaning of imperium as “sovereignty”). 26
But around 1743, according to the historian P. J. Marshall, a shift occurred
and the idea of a single British empire consisting of its territorial holdings
surfaced. And by the 1760s (after Britain’s victories over France), it became
“conventional to speak and write of a single British Empire” that included
all of Britain’s overseas territories, plantations, and colonies. 27 This discourse
of a single empire was especially potent among the Anglophone inhabitants
of the New World, who began for the first time “to habitually describe their
community as the ‘British Empire.’” 28 As we will see later, the meaning would
be submerged in the mid-nineteenth century, only to be conjured again in the
late nineteenth century. But whatever the later usages and shifts of “empire,”
the long eighteenth century remains transformative: It saw the first development
of the empire concept distinct from its Latin roots.” 29
Contours of American Expansion, 1776–1898
How does the ascendance of the United States compare to these British devel-
opments? Surely it also saw territorial growth: From 1803 to 1853, the
United States expanded its territorial holdings by more than two million
square miles. By the time it acquired Alaska and Hawaii, its territory had
expanded almost fourfold from the territory of the original thirteen colonies.
The U.S. government thereby became “one of the great landlords of world

history.” 30 This territorial expansion came with population growth, just as
Britain’s had. In 1850, the population in the territories newly opened to col-
onization (which exceeded half a million square miles) numbered about 10
million souls. 31 This was 44 percent of the nation’s total, which was more than
that of Britain’s earlier Atlantic empire. In 1700, for example, the percentage
of the total population of Britain and its North American and West Indies
colonies that lived in the colonies was only 7 percent; at most, it reached 21
percent in 1750. 32
Given the immensity of expansion, it is appropriate that contemporaries did
not hesitate to think of the United States as an expanding empire. Founding
statesmen referred to their expanding country as an “American empire” and a
“rising empire.” This was an easy appropriation from British discourse. Given
“the coming of Revolution and the welding of the Thirteen Colonies into a
new sovereign nation, the substitution of the phrase ‘American Empire’ for
British came easily and naturally.” 33 To be sure, Reverend Thomas Brockaway
in 1784 scripted America’s new imperium as but a continuation of the British
imperium: “Empire, learning, and religion have in past ages been traveling
from east to west, and this continent is their last western state. Here then is
God erecting a stage on which to exhibit the great things of his kingdom.” 34 At
least until the Civil War, this self-identification of empire was not uncommon.
The word empire to refer to the United States remained a dominant part of
political discourse. 35
In short, not unlike Britain’s expansion earlier, U.S. expansion involved
territorial growth, population growth, and ideological developments. But what
about state involvement? It is here that popular narratives of U.S. history would
stop us from making comparisons. In these narratives, U.S. expansion was led
by self-reliant settlers who conquered an empty wilderness. 36 Expansion was a
private affair rather than a process led by an aggressive and aggrandizing state.
This is how the “West has come to stand for independence, self-reliance, and
individualism.” 37 The narrative also entails long-standing social science claims
about the so-called weakness of the American state. Tocqueville claimed that
Americans “did not have any neighbors, and consequently no great wars, and
neither ravages nor conquest to fear,” thus they did not need “a numerous
army, nor great generals.” 38 Many social scientists similarly claim that the U.S.
state before 1877 was weak and devoid of a strong centralized government. 39

Supposedly, even if the state wanted to play a part in expansion, it did not have
the capacities to do so.
But these are misconceptions. First, expansion did not unfold into an empty
wilderness. Nearly all of the territories the United States eventually annexed
had been populated and/or governed by rival powers. After independence, the
eastern colonies and the Northwest Territory, which was organized in 1787,
were bounded by Spanish Florida in the south, Spanish Louisiana to the imme-
diate west, and British Canada to the north. After the Louisiana Purchase,
Spain still had territory in Florida, and its Mexico territory bordered the south-
west, whereas British territory flanked the young United States from the north
and northwest. Second, along these borders, across them, and within them
were diverse populations. The Northwest Territory already had 60,000 inhab-
itants in 1796. Previously, in the trans-Applachian region, the resistance of the
Choctaw, Creek, Miami, and other tribes had frustrated the early founders’
dreams of easy expansion. In other territories, not only were there multiple
Native American groups but also various non-Anglo populations. Creoles, free
blacks (many from Santo Domingo), and Cajuns populated the Louisiana terri-
tory. Peoples of Hispano, Mexican, and Spanish-Indian descent populated the
Spanish-held territories. Few if any of these groups were easily reconciled to
U.S. intrusion. 40
It follows that the American state had to take a part in expansion. 41 “The
frontier,” notes historian Peter Onuf, “required the exercise of authority . . . by
a strong national government.” 42 The state was needed first of all to explore
and survey land. Although images of valiant individual explorers like Lewis
and Clark permeate America’s consciousness, in fact the U.S. Army led most
expeditions throughout the continent. 43 Furthermore, the state had to induce or
otherwise attract settlement. The Oregon Donation Act of 1850 offered settlers
generous land grants to persuade them to move in. 44 Also, the state was neces-
sary as a coercive force to pacify land. From 1820 to the beginning of the Civil
War, fifty-seven military forts were established in Alabama to subdue resistance
from Native Americans. By 1868, the U.S. Army had more troops stationed
in the West than in the South (even before the end of Reconstruction). 45 Sub-
duing Indians was America’s “central military task throughout the nineteenth
century.” 46

Patterns of Empire
Moreover, whereas military power was necessary for subduing native pop-
ulations, it was likewise necessary for fending off international rivals and facil-
itating territorial acquisitions. Consider how Florida was won. Although it
is true that some East Florida residents before U.S. annexation had begun to
challenge Spanish rule, it nonetheless took the federal government to make the
challenge real and to finalize annexation. In 1811, Congress secretly passed
the No Transfer Resolution, which expressed America’s resolve that Florida
would not fall into the hands of any foreign power. Subsequently, General
George Matthews bribed locals to foment discontent against Spanish rule and
proceeded to use military force to seize East Florida in March 1812. 47 Although
Matthews’s efforts were later disavowed in public by President James Madi-
son’s administration, all of the Floridas were eventually taken under the aus-
pices of the Adams-Onis Treaty in 1819. And this occurred only after the
federal government’s forceful hand had pounded the region. Andrew Jackson’s
army of close to three thousand men had invaded East Florida, conquered
recalcitrant Seminoles, and occupied St. Marks and Pensacola. 48 Boundaries
were thus born from bullets; frontiers were tamed by force.
The same is true for most of the other major territories acquired by the
United States. Taking the Oregon Territory demanded displays of force to
ward off Spanish, Russian, and English claims. 49 The conquest of the area
that would eventually become Texas, California, and New Mexico entailed
the deployment of federal troops, leading to the Mexican War in 1848. Nobel
Laureate Octavio Paz called this war “one of the most unjust wars in the his-
tory of imperialism.” 50 Later, it would take British commentators to remind
prominent American statesmen of this conquest. In 1945, during postwar plan-
ning meetings, President Roosevelt remarked to the British Colonial Secretary
Oliver Stanley, “I do not want to be unkind or rude to the British but in 1841,
when you acquired Hong Kong, you did not acquire it by purchase.” Stanley
retorted: “Let me see, Mr. President, that was about the time of the Mexican
War.” 51
The aftermath of such conquests demanded yet more state involvement. All
of the new territories, once declared under U.S. sovereignty and organized into
territorial governments (before statehood), were governed by military com-
manders. These commanders spent much of their time suppressing resistance
and securing the conditions for peaceful settlement, exploration, and commer-
cial development. The targets of suppression were Native Americans in most
cases, but these were not the only groups visited by the coercive hand of the

economic development occurred at all. This also involved trade with Native Americans. See

American state. After Brig. General Stephen W. Kearny unilaterally annexed
New Mexico to the United States in 1846, military occupation persisted until
1851. Kearny’s Organic Act displaced the Hispano aristocracy and elevated the
“American Party” of Anglos and some pro-American Hispanos into power. His
successor, Colonel Sterling S. Price, then faced a series of uprisings from His-
pano peasants and Pueblo Indians – led partly by Hispano aristocrats and
clergy. In response, Price assaulted the town of Mora and led a force of
480 volunteers, regulars, and civilians from Sante Fe across to Taos Pueblo
to suppress the remnants of resistance. In subsequent years, antigovernment
assaults by Nuevomexicanos (1847) and the Navajo (1848) also met military
force. 52
The new U.S. state even deployed its power overseas (see Table 1.1). In the
early nineteenth century, the U.S. Navy sent ships or troops as far as Tripoli,
Tunis, and Algiers. It also intervened in the Caribbean to secure the promise
of trade there and with Latin America. 53 As the United States later looked
for profitable passageways to the Pacific through Nicaragua and Panama, it
continued to deploy naval power, dispatching troops to Nicaragua on several
occasions or meddling with Cuba and Santo Domingo. 54 The search for trade
with Asia extended America’s military hand even farther. Attempts to get Japan
to open up to American goods in the 1850s led to various demonstrations of
naval force, and troops were deployed on various occasions to Formosa, Korea,
and China. Similarly, just as Walt Whitman’s 1860 poem “The New Empire”
suggested that the Pacific would become the “vast highway” to Asia, various
instances of American force took place in the Pacific. 55 The American navy
moved into Samoa, Fiji, and Drummond Island in the early 1840s, which in
turn unleashed military attacks on native islanders.
All of this suggests that the U.S. state was no less militaristic or interven-
tionist than the British state. Data on military spending are informative. Even

if we bracket local state militias, military expenditures far outweighed other
expenditures of the national budget. It accounted for at least 72 percent of
total spending and 94 percent each year (except for one year) between 1808
and 1848. This includes naval spending, which from 1798 to 1848 “either
outpaced or approximately equaled all civilian federal spending combined.” 56
When we compare U.S. and British expenditures directly (from 1700 to 1814
for Britain and from 1800 to 1914 for the United States), we see remarkable
similarity in the structure of spending (see Figure 1.3). 57
Both the U.S. and British states, therefore, were fiscal-military states. The
British fiscal-military state financed itself partly by drawing on trade revenues.
In turn, trade depended on expansion to cultivate more trade and protect
existing trading networks. 58 Similarly for the American state, customs revenue
constituted the greatest proportion of total federal revenues; customs revenue
was continually enhanced by expanded trade in and with the western territories.
Meanwhile, newly conquered land was fiscally lucrative for the state directly
because tax on land was among the three top sources of revenue (besides cus-
toms and excise taxes), and indirectly because new settlement raised property

values and contributed to income growth (that in turn facilitated increased cus-
toms and excise taxes). 59 Expansion was not an appurtenance. It was dependent
on American state power even as state power was dependent on expansion.
The interventionist U.S. state was more like the English state than Ameri-
can exceptionalist thought would have us believe. But was it also an imperial
state? The foregoing discussion discloses some similarities between Britain’s
and America’s territorial expansion. It remains to be seen whether this territo-
rial expansion was also a process of empire formation.
The Forms of Enland’s Imperial Ascendance
As seen, Britons in the long eighteenth century thought of Britain and its terri-
tories as an “empire.” The called it the “British empire.” They also referred to
overseas territories as “colonies.” It seems, therefore, that Britain was a colonial
empire. But we have to be careful. The use of the term empire at the time does
not necessarily equate with the analytic concept used by scholars today to refer
to a system of unequal political power between a metropole and its territories.
It might have been used only to refer to the sovereign power of a monarch. 60
Nor does the word colony as used by Britons at the time necessarily equate
with the notion of modern colonies (as administrative units subordinated to a
higher power). Beginning in the late 1600s, the word colonies was often used
synonymously with “dominions” and, in some instances, “plantations.” 61 So
was this really a colonial empire in our analytic sense?
There are good reasons for staking the claim that Britain’s overseas ter-
ritories in the long eighteenth century constituted a colonial empire. On
the one hand, the earliest acquired territories were considered a part of the
monarch’s direct domain (even chartered companies, although private bodies,
acted under the authority of the Crown). New territories were not unlike Eng-
land’s medieval territorial expanse by which all territories were equal (as in
equally subject to the authority of the Crown). These territories included the
Channel Islands of Guernsey and Jersey, Wales, and the Isle of Man. 62 On the
other hand, as more territories were later acquired, new distinctions emerged
that helped create a new colonial system, such as that between the monarch’s
realm, which included England and Wales (and after 1707, Scotland), and the
monarch’s “dominions” or “dependencies.” The territories acquired during the

matters for overseas territories. And the fact that England lacked a single-document written
constitution meant that there was never one authoritative text to guide policy toward overseas
territories Of course, the territories themselves had their own constitutions. But these were
largely customary, developed slowly, and often open to dispute. See Greene (1994b), pp. 25–

long eighteenth century occupied the latter category. Rather than being “Part
of the Realm of England,” they were considered as “Separate and Distinct
Dominions.” 63 In this sense, the new territories were incorporated as substates
of a realm. But they were also colonial states in our analytic sense, for they
were appendages of the metropolitan state and, most tellingly, subordinate
to it. They were seen by Crown officials as “dependent dominions,” where
dependence signified “both weakness and subordination in relation to some
person, body, or institution that was stronger or more competent and supe-
rior.” The new territories were thus akin to the way in which “wives, children,
servants were dependents.” 64 As John Dickinson in Pennsylvania would remark
in 1768, they were not only “mixt, but dependent” upon the Crown. 65 That is,
they were juridically inferior and subordinate; they were rendered subordinate
because they were deemed inferior.
The subordination of the territories was a layered historical development.
Some of the earliest territories settled in the 1600s were proprietary govern-
ments whereby the Crown delegated appointments and political control almost
fully to the proprietors. The monarch did not have representatives in the areas
controlled by the Hudson’s Bay Company or in the chartered governments of
Rhode Island, Connecticut, or the Carolinas. 66 However, most of those early
charters were eventually amended or revoked, leading to a form of “royal gov-
ernment” (also known sometimes as Crown Colonies or royal colonies) that
involved direct royal control and hence an imperial hierarchy. This was the
form that the vast majority of the territories in the Americas and the West
Indies eventually took. 67 It found precedence in the early colonies of Jamaica
and New York, both of which were classified as “conquered countries” akin to
Ireland. As conquered countries, they were “subject to the King’s Prerogative
Royal”; the king would impose the identical laws of England at his whim,
if at all. 68 Similarly, royal government meant that territories were subject to
royal control in ways that domestic territories (or those that were “Part of the
realm of England”) were not. In this sense, they became “colonies” or, as many
similar territories were later named, “British possessions.” 69

“In this concept each colony was thus a separate corporate entity, a body politic authorized by
the crown, with jurisdiction over a well-defined territory and its own distinctive institutions,
laws, customs, and eventually, history and identity.” From Greene (1986), p. 10.

the exceptions; hence even the governor – the nominal representative of the Crown – was
elected, together with the executive council. “Here the Crown had no authority at all.” But this
was the extreme of colonial autonomy. See Fieldhouse (1982), p. 61.
Greene (1986), pp. 23–4.
Later the distinction would be codified further by Parliament. The Interpretation Act of 1889
classified most overseas territories as “British possessions” and defined them as “any part of
Her Majesty’s dominions exclusive of the United Kingdom.” Quoted in Finley (1976), p. 167;
emphasis added.Imperial Paths to Power, 1688–1939

Metropolitan control over the colonies was exercised in various ways. Per-
haps the most important was royal appointment. Territories had their own elec-
tive assemblies (except for military outposts like Nova Scotia and Newfound-
land). In Jamaica and Barbados, the rights and privileges of such assemblies had
been established before 1689 and remained the strongest of the assemblies. 70
But the highest appointment, the colonial governor, was made by the Crown. In
turn, the governor appointed members of the colonial council (that served as an
advisory group, a colonial court of appeal, and a legislative upper house) and
other bureaucratic posts. Furthermore, the governor exercised veto power over
the assemblies and could call and even dissolve them. In these ways, therefore,
the colonial governor represented “a monarchical power that was supposedly
stronger in the colonies than in England.” 71 In fact, whereas the monarchy at
home was bound by the Triennial and later the Septennial, colonial governors
could (and often did) dissolve the lower legislative assemblies without having
to specify when they would be again summoned. And governors could establish
courts of law and appoint and dismiss judges, even though the Crown at home
had lost such powers with the Act of Settlement in 1701. 72
As colonial governments became officially subject to the Crown’s will, the
organs of the Crown’s will accordingly became more elaborate. Here we see
the formation of an imperial hierarchy corresponding to an expanding impe-
rial bureaucracy. In the 1670s, the Lords of Trade, a permanent committee
of the king’s Privy Council, was created to exert greater supervision over the
colonies. It required reports from colonial governors and expanded “in scope
and specificity the royal instructions given to governors to direct them in their
conduct of government.” 73 This body also enacted various measures to restrict
the legislative assemblies’ powers over the purse. 74 Such meddling was inten-
sified during historical periods. During the 1740s and 1750s, for example, it
used legislative review, royal instructions, and the royal veto over colonial laws
to more closely supervise the colonies. Later, after being renamed the Board
of Trade, it sometimes took on the responsibility of making appointments and
issuing instructions to governors. 75
The metropolitan Parliament also exercised control (not least as the Crown
itself became subject to Parliament at home). In the late seventeenth and early
eighteenth centuries, parliamentary legislation for the colonies was largely
restricted to concerns of foreign affairs and trade (such as the Navigation
Acts). But as the long eighteenth century progressed, so too did parliamentary
power. From the Glorious Revolution through the first decades of the 1700s,
Parliament passed laws that strengthened Crown control over colonies; these

included acts dealing with the Newfoundland trade (1699) and fixing the value
of certain foreign coins in the colonies (1708). 76 Throughout the century, Par-
liament often acted in the interests of English business groups and other lobbies
at home rather than in the interests of settlers and merchants in the territories.
Those domestic lobbies had direct access and representation in Parliament, but
the distance separating territorial subjects was too great to allow such access. 77
Finally, and most notoriously, Parliament increasingly meddled in the inter-
nal affairs of the colonies. By the time of the Stamp Act in 1765, Parliament
had become “the ultimate arbiter of Imperial affairs.” 78 Parliament exercised
power, but colonists did not have representation. 79 The English state was an
imperial state indeed.
America’s Empire
Was the U.S. federal government also an imperial state? In one of the only
explicitly comparative examinations of America’s territorial expansion, the
historian Robin Winks asks a similar question. Surveying the history of west-
ward expansion to the mid-nineteenth century, he asks: “Was this first period
of expansion imperialistic?” His answer: “Perhaps.” Winks’ reluctance rests on
the fact that even though the U.S. federal government acquired new territory,
it did not keep them as colonies. Instead, it turned them into equal states in
the American Union. This makes U.S. expansion fundamentally different from
European expansion. It “was not ‘imperialism’ per se but continentalism,” says
Winks. 80
This is a standard part of the exceptionalist narrative. The western territo-
ries did not become colonial appendages or dependencies of the United States,
but rather equal members of the body politic. Settlers were given equal rights
and privileges under the law; they were equal citizens rather than subordinated
colonial subjects. In this regard, the U.S. territorial system was not like Britain’s
empire. 81 The other part of this narrative is the supposed political genius of
America’s Founding Fathers. By making the U.S. government an expanding
state that acquired territories and turned them into equal states, Thomas Jef-
ferson and his peers inaugurated a novel republicanism that broke with their
imperial English past. Rather than creating a hierarchy of power, they created
a federated union of equal territories, “an expanding union of republics held
together by ties of interest and affection.” 82 Rather than an empire opposed to

liberty like England’s empire had been, they created an “empire of liberty.” The
American founders thereby solved the age-old imperial problem of reconciling
territorial expanse with liberty and law, security, and freedom.
In this light, American expansion appears as the antithesis of European
empire – a notion registered at the time by David Humphreys, George Wash-
ington’s officer:
All former empires rose, the work of guilt,
On conquest, blood, or usurpation built;
But we, taught wisdom by their woes and crimes,
Fraught with their lore, and born to better times;
Our constitutions form’d on freedom’s base,
Which all the blessings of all lands embrace;
Embrace humanity’s extended cause,
A world of our empire, for a world of our laws . . . 83
Still, this exceptionalist narrative remains dangerously simplistic at worst
and misleading at best. It is right to point out that the territories acquired on
the continent (and later Alaska and Hawaii) eventually became fully fledged
states in the Union. The story is wrong, however, as it covers up everything
else that was involved.
Continental Colonialism
Consider how states were made. How did territories become states in the
Union? It was not so simple as signing a document. Before settlers and subjects
in the new territories could be granted statehood and citizenship, they had
to undergo a period of “territorial government.” This meant that the newly
acquired territories were kept as subordinated dependencies, subject to the
power of the U.S. president and Congress, without representation. The origins
of this system lay in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which established a
three-stage process before statehood. First, the federal government appointed
a governor and three judges. The governor wielded legislative power; even
settlers did not have a say. Second, when the free white male population had
passed five thousand, an elective two-house legislature could be established; but
the upper house remained appointees of the president. The federally appointed
governor had absolute veto power and could “convene, prorogue, and dissolve
the assembly at his pleasure.” 84 Finally, the territory could write up a state
constitution, only after which the territory could become a state. Even then,
the U.S. Congress had the power to approve or reject statehood. 85
The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 added yet more layers of control to the terri-
torial system. President Jefferson started the important precedent of appointing
a military governor to the territory before the territory could even get to the
83

Patterns of Empire
first stage of the process. The territory was then subjected to autocratic military
rule – no governor, no judges. And during this stage of military government,
inhabitants were not even given the protection of a bill of rights. 86 Territorial
government would begin only when Congress decided it was ready. 87 This hap-
pened for many territories. California and New Mexico were run initially by
military governors. Alaska was not organized as a territory for forty-five years,
meaning that for those forty-five years inhabitants did not have representation
in the metropole or even in a local legislature. Nor did they have a bill of rights.
It was a military occupation.
In sum, the territorial system entailed a colonial structure very much akin
to Britain’s overseas empire. Just as the Crown, its bureaucratic agents, and
Parliament ruled on high in the English system, so did the presidency, its
branches (first the Department of State, the Treasury Department, and later,
in 1873, the Department of Interior), and Congress rule at the apex of the
U.S. territorial system. 88 Making territorial governors appointees of the U.S.
president simply replaced the previous monarchical powers of appointment
with presidential ones. Having symbolically cut off the king’s head, the new
American system replaced him with the U.S. president. Furthermore, the pres-
ident’s agencies charged with administering territorial affairs acted similarly
to the Lords of Trade in the king’s Privy Council. In the Department of State,
“appointments and removals of governors and secretaries were studied and
submitted for presidential action . . . leaves of absence were granted or refused
in the name of the president . . . instructions, advice, and reprimands were sent
out on a variety of subjects.” 89 These appointment powers were used to med-
dle in territorial affairs, not unlike the practice of appointment by the Privy
Council in the British empire. Not surprisingly, people in the western territo-
ries sometimes made unflattering comparisons between U.S. federal officials
and the ministers of King George III. 90 A newspaper in the Dakota territory
declared in 1877: “We are so heartily disgusted with our dependent condition,
with being snubbed at every turn in life, with having all our interest subjected
to the whims and corrupt acts of persons in power that we feel very much as
thirteen colonies felt.” 91 Later, in 1903, Albert Bushnell Hart (president of the
American Political Science Association) noted that in “any other country such
[territorial] governments would be called ‘colonial.’ . . . In truth, the territories
are and ever have been colonies.” 92

The imperial and colonial character to the territorial system was by design
rather than in effect. The territorial governments were directly modeled after
Britain’s own colonies. James Monroe feared that the newly acquired territo-
ries would rebel against the federal government just as he and his peers had
previously rebelled against the British empire. Consequently, he “considered
a strong governor to be necessary from the beginning of representative gov-
ernment, both to get the people in harness and to prevent rebellions before
statehood was attained.” 93 The fact that the architects of the system had pre-
viously revolted against British imperialism did not temper the imperialism of
their own system; it made them more willing to impose stronger controls over
the territories than Britain had previously exercised.
In certain regards, settlers in American territories had less political auton-
omy than settlers in Britain’s previous colonial empire. In the first stage of
the U.S. territorial system, federal appointees monopolized legislative, execu-
tive, and judicial functions. But in Britain’s empire, colonial assemblies were
present from the beginning. Even in the second stage of the territorial system,
when legislatures were established, the federal state had more powers over
territorial subjects than did the British state (at least before 1763, when the
British state tightened its controls over its territories). “In this light,” notes
Eblen, “the Ordinance of 1787 cannot be viewed as innovative or progressive
in any basic sense, even in the provision for statehood; on the contrary, its sys-
tem of colonial government was decidedly more authoritarian than that of the
British.” 94
America’s continental colonialism was more imperial and authoritarian than
Britain’s settler empire in theory, and it was even more so in practice. For
instance, although the British state controlled top appointments and restricted
the power of the colonial assemblies, the actual operations of the system gave
colonial assemblies more power than official doctrine implied. One way in
which assemblies influenced colonial governors was by their control over
salary: Assemblies had the right to vote for the governors’ pay from local taxes,
which meant that governors often had to negotiate with powerful assembly-
men and often grant them many concessions. Assemblies also wielded other
informal powers, which made it easy for them to conceive of themselves as
local variants of or parallels to the House of Commons at home. 95 By con-
trast, in the U.S. territorial system, governors’ salaries and those of other offi-
cials were set by Congress, leaving the local legislative assemblies with little
power. 96 Furthermore, most scholarship on the British system has shown that
although there was an official imperial hierarchy, unofficially London was
often forced to engage in a process of two-way “negotiation” with its colonies,
whereby loyalty could only be secured by granting colonial privileges and

concessions. 97 In the U.S. system, Washington’s control over all appointments
and salaries made for a situation in which there was much less negotiation.
The federal government often removed and replaced territorial governors at its
whim. And the local courts were subject to direct federal control: Territorial
judges were removed and replaced just as often as were territorial governors. 98
The imperial character of America’s territorial system is further disclosed
in the federal officials’ discourse about territorial populations, which took on
a strong colonial tone. After the Louisiana Purchase, Federalists asserted that
New Orleans was populated by “a Mixture of Americans, English, Spanish, and
French and crouded [sic] every year . . . with two or three thousand boatmen
from the backcountry remarkable for their dissipated habits, unruly tempers,
and lawless conduct.” 99 One official wrote that “Otters” were “more capable of
self-government than Louisiana’s Gallo-Hispano-Indium omnimum gatherum
of savages and adventurers, whose pure morals are expected to sustain and
glorify our republic.” 100 Thomas Jefferson was no less condescending. He
complained that the Creoles were “as yet incapable of self-government as
children”; the “principles of popular Government are utterly beyond their
comprehension.” 101 Jefferson was not at all eager to see the territory pass into
statehood and in fact suggested that statehood should be delayed for as long
as possible.
Even relations with white settler populations took on an imperial tone. Sec-
retary of the Treasury, Oliver Wolcott, referred to the Northwest Territory in
1795 as a “dependent colony.” 102 The first ruler of the Northwest Territory,
Arthur St. Clair, insisted that the inhabitants of the territories were not full
American citizens but “subjects,” and repeatedly referred to them as “infants.”
St. Clair used his autocratic powers to try to keep the territory in a subor-
dinated position by, for example, splitting the territory into smaller divisions
to divide the population and thereby preventing the population from reach-
ing sixty thousand. In response, St. Clair’s subjects often complained about
his “colonial, oppressive and unequal government.” One judge of Ohio com-
plained to Jefferson in 1802 that the territorial government was a “true tran-
script of our old English Colonial Governments,” adding that “our Governor
is clothed with all the power of a British Nabob.” 103 As late as the 1880s, terri-
torial subjects deployed such discourse. In 1884, Martin Maginnis, a delegate
to Congress from Montana Territory (who could speak but not vote), declared

that the “present Territorial system . . . is the most infamous system of colonial
government that was ever seen on the face of the globe.” He continued:
Territories are the colonies of your Republic, situated three thousand miles away from
Washington by land, as the thirteen colonies were situated three thousand miles away
from London by water. And it is a strange thing that the fathers of our Repub-
lic . . . established a colonial government as much worse than that which they revolted
against as one form of government can be worse than another. 104
The standard exceptionalist narrative covers up such discourse and the impe-
rial relations of which it bears witness. It likewise occludes how prevalent the
territorial system has been in the history of American state formation. Excep-
tionalist thought tells us that “only very briefly has the mainland United States
ever been considered an empire rather than a nation”; but this overlooks the
fact that “three-quarters of the area of the fifty states was at one point under
territorial government of some kind” (as the political scientist Bartholomew
Sparrow notes). 105 The cumulative existence from 1784 to 1912 of the twenty-
eight contiguous territories before they became states amounts to 544 years. 106
New Mexico suffered the longest period before statehood: sixty-two years. 107
This means that “children born when New Mexico was first brought under
American control were to be in their sixties when New Mexico became a
state.” 108 It follows that the United States has never been “a nation of states”
with equal standing. 109 For nearly all of its history, it has had territories along-
side its states. The United States has been primarily an empire-state rather than
a nation-state. 110
Comparative Exceptionalisms
If exceptionalist narratives run the risk of downplaying the imperial dimensions
of American territorial expansion, they likewise run the risk of overstating the
imperial dimensions of the British empire. The second follows from the first.
Treating the American empire of liberty as exceptionally novel and liberal, the
exceptionalist narrative portrays the British empire as vulgarly authoritarian.
But was it?
For a start, the discourse of empire among Britain’s territorial subjects is
telling. As seen, America’s territorial subjects registered complaints about the
territorial system. The views of British colonials, however, were much less
oppositional. Surely the planters of Jamaica or other Britons abroad often
criticized London’s imperial meddling. And the concatenation of criticisms
among New Englanders led to the American Revolution. But prior to the

revolution, British settlers had developed a view of the British empire that was
remarkably positive. More importantly, they had developed a view of their
empire as exceptional; as uniquely free, liberal, and democratic. This prefigured
the Americans’ later sense of imperial uniqueness. It also set the basis for the
notion of an “empire of liberty.”
The British sense of imperial uniqueness began to emerge as early as the
Glorious Revolution. As Greene notes, “many contemporary observers, English
and foreign, agreed that the English people’s unique system of law and liberty
was what principally distinguished them from all other people on the face of
the globe. The proud boast of the English was that they, unlike most other
Europeans, had retained their identity as a free people by safeguarding their
liberty through their laws.” 111 The identity was forged in direct opposition
to other European states. Sir John Fortescue in the early seventeenth century
set the tone. He contended that England, unlike France where “what pleased
the prince . . . had the force of law,” enjoyed a unique system whereby the
monarchy was constrained by the law and the people “preserve[d] their rights
through the law.” Englishmen were the only ones who were “ruled by laws
they themselves desire[d].” Their laws “favour[ed] liberty in every case.” 112
Later, Whig theorist Henry Care similarly contended that nations like France
and Spain were ruled by “Arbitrary” tyrants, whereas England’s government
was “the best in the World.” 113 Other writers such as John Milton insisted that
England was “the mansion house of liberty,” and that this was the essence of
“England’s peculiarity.” 114
After the Glorious Revolution, this notion of English exceptionalism was
deployed in regard to empire as well as nation. Settlers carried the ideology to
the New World, conceiving themselves as geographically afar but politically
subject to the same privileges of law and liberty as at home. Their sons in the
colonies considered themselves “born to Liberty.” 115 As Greene notes, “the
English system of law and liberty was thus crucial to their [the settlers’] ability to
maintain their identity as English people and to continue to think of themselves
as to be thought of those by those who remained in England as English.” 116
As with the Americans’ self-conceived imperial identity, this image of a liberal
empire did not include subject peoples like Native Americans. But it did include
all white colonial subjects overseas, from Barbadians to North Americans, who
increasingly came to conceive of themselves as part of a larger community of
Britons. This was a community “in which Caledonians and Americans, as well
as the English, could participate.” 117 Arthur Young pointed out in 1772 that
peoples in the colonies were conjoined with Britons at home, living under

“one nation, united under one sovereign, speaking the same language and
enjoying the same liberty.” 118
Given the hierarchical structure of the empire, how were such ideas about
liberty even possible? Part of it was an increasing sense of community cov-
ered under the term “British Empire.” During the second quarter of the eigh-
teenth century, as noted earlier, Anglophones in North America and the West
Indies began “for the first time habitually to describe their community as the
‘British Empire.’” 119 Enabled by transformations in communications around
the British Atlantic, colonists saw themselves in union with the British Isles. 120
This imagined community, however, took on its meaning as a community
based on shared liberties more specifically through the political structure of
the empire itself. The very sorts of settler privileges and freedoms discussed
earlier formed the basis for the ideological conception. For instance, although
colonists did not enjoy representation in Parliament, their assemblies nonethe-
less gave them local representation. In Barbados, “the Council and Assembly
were regarded by the white settlers as the equivalent of the House of Lords and
House of Commons in England.” 121 Like other whites in the British Atlantic,
they likewise considered their territory as “extensions of England, rather than
extended dependencies.” 122 We have seen that the colonies were indeed depen-
dencies in the sense that, officially, they were subordinated to the will of the
Crown-in-Parliament. But the idea of metropolitan extension was not com-
pletely off the mark. In the northern colonies, the assemblies were elected by
a wide franchise of white men and, as noted, they did exert certain checks
against Crown-appointed governors. In Jamaica, the local assemblies had been
especially powerful, obtaining a reputation for being particularly assertive. 123
Besides using their assemblies, colonists also developed legal apparatuses
granting them rights and privileges that were not dissimilar from those they
would have enjoyed at home. The British state never established once and for
all which laws from home applied abroad (the common law or the statue law
only?), but this indeterminacy helped rather than hindered the colonists’ cause.
Lacking concrete decrees from London, local courts and legislatures “had wide
latitude to determine for themselves which laws [of England] applied” and
so used all kinds of English law – “the common law, presettlement statutes,
and postsettlement statutes [etc.].” 124 The lieutenant governor of Virginia,
holding position from 1727 to 1749, could thereby declare that the colonies
enjoyed laws that were “exactly suited to the Circumstances of the Respective
Governments, and as near as possible [as] it can be, conformable to the Laws

and Customs of England.” These included guaranteeing “traditional English
legal guarantees of life, liberty, and property.” 125
The conception of the empire as based on law and liberty was not restricted
to the colonists. It was also articulated in the metropole. 126 English public
opinion at home did not find the privileges enjoyed by colonists inappropriate.
Conceiving of overseas colonists as commercial vanguards who contributed to
the kingdom through their commercial ventures, they took “pride in the com-
mercial vigour that was thought to flow from the local liberties appropriate
to communities of free British people living overseas.” 127 Various prominent
writers and philosopher-thinkers contributed to the ideology (especially in the
1740s with the War of Jenkins’ Ear and anti-Walopean agitation), formu-
lating Lockean connections between property and liberty. Such connections
ultimately contributed to “a vision of the British Empire as Protestant, com-
mercial, maritime and free founded on the sanctity of property as much at
home as abroad, in the metropolis and in the colonies.” 128
In brief, the British empire was conceived by contemporaries as a fundamen-
tally unique empire. It was a “free and virtuous empire, founded in consent
and nurtured in liberty and trade.” 129 It was “Protestant, commercial, mar-
itime and free” in opposition to Catholic Spain and France. 130 In America,
said Arthur Young, “Spain, Portugal and France have planted despotisms;
only Britain liberty.” 131 As David Armitage summarizes, the British empire
was “everything that the aspirant universal monarchies of seventeenth-century
were not, and could not be – an empire for liberty.” 132 Of course, with the
Stamp Act, this ideology of a benign British empire was shattered. But the
discourse of British exceptionalism reveals that the Americans did not so much
invent a novel conception of expansion and empire as they did appropriate and
rearticulate the idioms and ideology of their former imperial master. After all,
American revolutionaries did not at first revolt: Working from the ideology of
the British empire as an identity of interests, right, and peoples, they hoped only
that Parliament would more properly enact the ideology. The problem – from
the Americans’ standpoint – was that King George III was corrupt, deviating
from the true tradition and ideals of the British empire. So when the Americans
embarked on the revolutionary path, they did so with reluctance. And they
did so only to try to enact the ideals already laid down for them by the very
imperial masters they sought to cast off. They aimed for a more perfect union
rather than an entirely different one. 133

Empire of Liberty?
What remains, then, of the notion that American expansion in the nineteenth
century was an “exception”? It is not that expansion was devoid of colonial
rule: The territorial system was even more authoritarian than British colonial-
ism. Nor is it that Americans articulated a liberal imperial identity in opposition
to other empires; the British had already prefigured that move. It might even be
said that all empires conceive of themselves as unique, special, and exceptional.
The only thing that remains is the fact that the territories, although subjected
to colonialism, were eventually admitted into the Union as equal states. This
remains one of the key bases for exceptionalists who resist the claim that
American expansion was “imperial” and who, therefore, see no warrant for
comparing the United States with the British empire. 134
Still, even this presumably exceptional dimension of American expansion
is rightly subject to question. First, incorporating colonized lands and peoples
as equal entities in a political formation is not unique to American expan-
sion. The Russian, Ottoman, and Chinese empires all had imperial systems
at one point or another whereby territories were incorporated as equal units.
France’s “assimilation” strategy was also incorporative in important respects.
And England had incorporated Wales and Scotland as equally subject parts of
the realm. 135
Second, America’s “empire for liberty” that incorporated territories as states
did not apply to everyone. For nonwhites, it was as repressive as any stereotypi-
cal empire. To be sure, slavery was a vital part of America’s imperial formation,
yet it was not abolished until 1865. The British empire had abolished slavery
much earlier, in 1833. 136 Furthermore, territorial expansion was a fundamen-
tally racialized process. Whereas white settlers may have initially welcomed
territorial annexation by the federal government, there were thousands upon
thousands of inhabitants whose wishes were never consulted. Native Amer-
icans, freed blacks, Creoles, and various populations of varied Spanish and
Mexican descent were essentially forced into accepting U.S. sovereignty. 137 In
New Mexico, as we have seen, many of these groups violently resisted annex-
ation from the outset. Furthermore, once subjected to U.S. sovereignty, these
populations remained imperial subjects. 138 “The Empire of Liberty was to be
made up of one people, dedicated to liberty under republican institutions,”

explain Tucker and Hendrickson. “There was to be no place here for subjects,
only for citizens. This was why, in principle, Negroes could have no permanent
position within the palladium of freedom and why, in practice, Indians as well
had to be excluded from it.” 139
Indeed, the American state’s dealings with Native Americans is exemplary
of the racialized character of America’s empire of liberty. As noted earlier, the
military repeatedly waged war on Native Americans and seized their land. The
federal government justified this process by the “right of discovery” doctrine
inherited from the British imperial system. In the 1823 Supreme Court case,
Johnson v. M’Intosh, the Native Americans’ “right of occupancy” was sub-
ordinated to the United States’ “right of discovery” (i.e. white man discovers
brown men and women already living on land, but because the discoverer is
white, he was there first). 140 Then came the Indian Removal Act under Presi-
dent Jackson in 1830, which was followed by a violent appropriation of Native
Americans’ land. By 1837, the Jackson administration had managed to remove
46,000 Native Americans from their land, thereby opening up yet more terri-
tory for white settlement. 141 To Jackson, the Native American population was
not even worthy of treaty. They were “subjects” plain and simple, and for the
federal government to negotiate treaties with subjects was an “absurdity.” 142
The Supreme Court shared this view. In its 1823 decision, it declared that
Indians were “an inferior race of people, without the privileges of citizens, and
under the perpetual protection and pupilage of the government.” 143
From Continental Colonialism to Overseas Empire
America’s treatment of Native Americans is informative, but even that does
not tell everything about the American empire during its ascendancy. If we
look beyond the North American continent, we find the limits of the excep-
tionalist narrative in their starkest form still. The American state conquered
the continent, and it also extended its reach overseas. Part of this exten-
sion took the form of military rule over foreign lands, turning them into de
facto protectorates. The story should be familiar: the Platt Amendment in
Cuba’s constitution in 1902 followed by bouts of occupation; military occu-
pation of Nicaragua (1912–1925); invasion and occupation of the Dominican

Tucker and Hendrickson (1990), p. 161. Schemes were proposed for governing these peoples
in ways that might lead to eventual liberty. Jefferson believed, for example, that only if African
Americans were transplanted back to Africa might they become able to attain liberty. But for
the time, and even in the long run, the empire of liberty was aimed at whites only. Hence,
three years after the 1787 Northwest Ordinance was enacted, the Naturalization Act of 1790
made citizenship a possibility only for “free whites.”

Republic (1916–1924) and Haiti (1915–1934). 144 But the overseas empire did
not just involve such temporary occupations. It also involved direct and pro-
longed colonial rule.
In 1898, the United States declared sovereignty over Hawaii and former
Spanish colonies of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines, and the “Moro” islands
of the Philippine archipelago. It later took half of Samoa (1900); the entire
Panama Canal Zone (1903), holding approximately 62,00 inhabitants; and
the Virgin Islands (1917), with over 26,000 inhabitants (at least 19,000 of
whom were classified as “Negro” by the Census). 145 The significance of these
acquisitions for U.S. imperialism cannot be overstated. On the one hand, they
can be seen as a continuation of westward expansion. Commenting on the
Treaty of Paris in 1898 by which the United States acquired Spain’s former
colonies, the London Times observed:
The signing of the Treaty of Paris . . . marks the beginning of a policy of expansion that
seems wholly at variance with the traditional aims of American statesmen. . . . But . . . the
new foreign policy is not so alien to the national character or so much at variance with
the previous history of the Republic as might at first sight appear. The Anglo-Americans
have at bottom the imperial instincts of the great governing and conquering race from
which they are sprung. . . . By swift steps they have carried the dominion of the Republic
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and have conquered, both politically and economically,
a vast extent of territory.
On the other hand, the new acquisitions marked something comparably
new. First, unlike previous territories on the western frontier, the new overseas
territories were not accompanied by the arrival of white settlers. Except for
Hawaii, white settlement was minimal. Instead, the U.S. military first occu-
pied the territories and were later replaced by civilian administrators from the
mainland. This was a form of administrative colonialism rather than settler
colonialism: A handful of white officials ruled at least two and a half million
colonized subjects.
Second, and more importantly, all of the new acquisitions except for Hawaii
and Alaska were declared “unincorporated” through a series of Supreme Court
cases known as “the insular cases.” The status of unincorporated meant that
the territories were “foreign in a domestic sense,” subject to the plenary power
of the U.S. Congress, but not afforded the full protection of the American
Constitution. Colonial peoples enjoyed some “fundamental rights,” but not all

Patterns of Empire
rights, and statehood was not necessarily the end goal. 146 In fact, none of the
legal documents that codified the conquests promised that the inhabitants of
seized lands would become citizens or that the new colonies would become
states. The U.S. Congress was given the right to decide. Given this, William
Willoughby (who served as a colonial official in Puerto Rico) accurately stressed
that the new acquisitions marked “the development of an entirely new phase
in the expansion of the United States.” Whereas previous acquisitions involved
“the incorporation of the new territory into the Union upon full equality with
the other States,” the new acquisitions meant that the territory under U.S.
sovereignty “would have to be divided into two classes having a different polit-
ical status; the one constituting the United States proper and enjoying full polit-
ical rights and privileges, and the other dependent territory in subordination to
the former and having its form of government and the rights of its inhabitants
determined for it.” In short, the United States had “definitely entered the class
of nations holding and governing over-sea colonial possessions.” 147
We see here the clear limits of Jefferson’s “empire of liberty” and the excep-
tionalist narrative. U.S. expansion did not in fact entail the incorporation of
all territories as equal states. Instead, the rule of colonial difference was firmly
applied. Some territories were states with equal citizens; other territories and
peoples were rendered dependent and subordinate. 148 The Supreme Court’s dis-
tinction between “incorporated” and “unincorporated” territory encapsulated
the difference exactly. Supreme Court Justice Henry Billings Brown clarified
that the difference was about race. Whereas contiguous territory in the west
had been “inhabited only by people of the same race [e.g. settlers], or by scat-
tered bodies of native Indians,” he said, the new overseas territories represented
“differences of race, habits, laws and customs.” 149 The idea was that Puerto
Ricans, Filipinos, Chamorros (in Guam), Samoans, Panamanians, and Virgin
Islanders were racially inferior and so not worthy of self-government. They did
not deserve independence or statehood. What Jacob Schurman of the Philip-
pine Commission said to President McKinley about the Philippines represents
the views held of all the colonies: “There is no prospect of their assimilation in
any period of time. They are distant from us by the diameter of the earth, the
inhabitants are barbarous and they are populous, and . . . we shall have to hold
them as perpetual vassals.” 150

Justice White justified the distinction between incorporated and unincorporated by “the prece-
dents of the Louisiana and Florida territories that were, he said, dependencies initially and were
later formally incorporated into the United States” [see Leibowitz (1989), p. 23]. For more
on the insular cases and “unincorporation,” see Burnett and Marshall (2001) and Sparrow
(2006).

Keeping the new colonial subjects as vassals is exactly what happened.
Congress had to decide what to do with the territories. For Puerto Rico and
the Philippines, it passed organic laws that created colonial governments with
no end point in clear sight. 151 Colonial control was to be extended indefinitely.
“There is a period in childhood,” summarized Secretary of War Elihu Root,
who was placed in charge of the territories, “during which the obligations
of a guardian can not be performed without the power to control the child’s
actions.” 152 Guam and Samoa met a similar fate and in some respects a worse
one. In their case, Congress did not even enact legislation establishing a proper
government. In the absence of congressional action, the two territories were
at the mercy of the U.S. president, who could create whatever form of gov-
ernment he wished – including none at all. He ultimately made them (and the
U.S. Virgin Islands later) subject to naval control, in effect establishing perma-
nent military governments wherein the naval commander became the de facto
colonial governor with autocratic powers. 153
The notion of “American empire” in this context took on a new meaning. It
was not an empire for liberty but rather an overseas colonial empire. Notably,
the discourse of American empire heightened in this period to reflect the new
meaning. In the New York Times, the number of articles using the phrase “our
empire” or “American Empire” leaped during the years 1898 to 1901. Some
of this empire talk was critical of America’s new ventures. Anti-expansionists
such as the Anti-Imperial League were quick to attack the new imperialism. 154
But much of the discourse was not so negative. Supreme Court Justice John
Marshall used the term “American Empire” without negative connotation in
his rulings on the insular cases. 155 A spate of popular books with titles like Our
Island Empire also emerged. One unapologetically referred to the United States
as an “Imperial State” ruling over a “Federal Empire.” 156 Articles in popular
magazines proliferated on the topic. As one writer observed, “‘Colonial’ and
‘Imperial’ are among the terms extensively used, in recent years, in referring
to the relations newly assumed by the United States.” 157 In 1906, the New
York Times pondered not whether the United States was an “empire” (for
its articles often spoke of it), but whether it would ever fall. 158 Decades later
it had not: In 1930, the Saturday Evening Post carried a two-part article,

Patterns of Empire
“The American Empire,” offering a “concise compendium of the American
empire.” 159
The fact that America’s new empire was neither of nor for liberty had ram-
ifications. In the Philippines, a group of landed elites based in Luzon, joining
others around the archipelago, had already begun a war of independence from
Spain by the time Admiral Dewey entered Manila Bay in 1898. Led by Gen-
eral Emilio Aguinaldo, they had declared an independent Philippine Republic
with its own constitution and legislature at the town of Malolos. The sudden
arrival of the Americans during the Spanish-American War was not a wel-
comed contingency. The revolutionaries had already been fighting Spain; they
were not open to facing yet another imperial master. The result was a war of
national liberation that became, from the Americans’ side, a war of conquest.
Ultimately the war claimed some 400,000 Filipino lives and the lives of 4,000
U.S. soldiers. 160
During the war, atrocities abounded (unsurprisingly, because many of the
U.S. military had prior experience against Native Americans in the west). In
1901, Brig. General Jacob Smith vowed to turn the island of Samar into a
“howling wilderness.” He ordered: “I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill
and burn, and the more you kill and burn the better you will please me. I
want all persons killed who are capable of bearing arms in actual hostilities
against the United States.” The age limit was ten. Civilians were killed along
with those bearing arms. Villages were burned and work animals slaughtered.
Samar’s population subsequently dropped by at least 50,000 over the next five
months. 161 In other parts of the archipelago, the U.S. military deployed tor-
turing techniques that would later resurface in Vietnam and Iraq. The primary
one was the “water cure,” known today as “water boarding.” A. F. Miller of
the 32nd Volunteer Infantry Regiment explained it: “Now, this is the way we
give them the water cure. Lay them on their backs, a man standing on each
hand and each foot, then put a round stick in the mouth and pour a pail of
water in the mouth and nose, and if they don’t give up pour in another pail.
They swell up like toads. I’ll tell you it’s a terrible torture.” 162
The war officially lasted for three years, but so-called insurgents fighting
for independence continued to resist occupation over the next decades. But
if the denial of independence summoned anti-imperial resistance among some
revolutionaries, the denial of statehood summoned resignation and resentment
among others. In the Philippines, a small group of wealthy men in Manila (lead-
ers of the Philippine Federal Party) had made statehood their goal. These elites
were distinct from the revolutionaries in the countryside: They had quickly col-
laborated with American occupation under the impression that statehood was

a real possibility. 163 Yet U.S. officials, not to mention Congress, consistently
brushed away their demands for incorporation. After many failed attempts,
and after some of them experienced the racism of their colonial masters first-
hand at the St. Louis Exposition of 1904, their calls for statehood quieted. They
astutely recognized the limits of America’s empire of liberty and the expanse
of its racism at once. 164
In Puerto Rico, demands for statehood had also been registered from the
very outset of military occupation. Juan Nieves summarized the attitude of
his educated peers in 1898: “Puerto Rico, annexed, living under the shelter
of the model Republic, will be a prosperous, happy and respected people.”
Nieves added that the very reason why the Puerto Ricans had been so quick
to accept American occupation and turn their backs on Spain was because
the people expected “to be constituted as a State, free, within the American
Union.” 165 Many of the Puerto Rican elite had had some knowledge of Amer-
ican continental expansion and were hopeful that the “grand empire . . . which
began in California, Texas, and Florida” (as one of their leaders put it) would
incorporate Puerto Rico similarly. 166 The Puerto Rican elite saw continuity
between America’s continental past and its overseas present, and their polit-
ical demands followed. They believed, as the exceptionalist narrative would
have them believe, that the United States would offer them an equal stake in
the empire of liberty as an incorporated territory. What they did not foresee
was the racism of their new imperial masters, which contributed to repeated
rejections of their calls for statehood status. Subsequently, many Puerto Ricans
became disillusioned with U.S. rule. Although they had never done so before,
some even began calling for national independence. 167
As neither national independence nor statehood was given to Puerto Rico
and the Philippines, the two colonies were instead subjected to control by
Washington. Both initially faced military governments whereby military gov-
ernors ruled according to their whims. The subsequent civilian administrations
concentrated power too. The governor general of the territories was invariably
a white U.S. citizen appointed by the U.S. president. Some local representa-
tion was offered through executive councils and legislative assemblies, but the
governor general and his peers from the mainland wielded ultimate control.
These were autocratic regimes akin to the territorial governments in the west,
yet there was no hope of later transitioning to statehood. Likewise, Puerto
Ricans and Filipinos were denied rights afforded U.S. citizens. The Supreme
Court and Congress decided that they were not U.S. citizens even though they
were subject to the control of the U.S. government. Later, in 1916, Congress
indeed passed the Jones Act, granting Puerto Ricans citizenship, but this was an

emergency measure designed to shore up Puerto Rican support for the pending
war with Germany. 168 And this was a very limited citizenship that was decid-
edly different from the kind white mainlanders enjoyed. It did not give Puerto
Ricans a trial by jury system. It did not grant them the right to vote for the U.S.
president, even though the president could send them to war. It did not give
them an equal voice in Congress. And if it so desired, Congress could take away
even this limited form of citizenship with the stroke of a pen. 169 Democracy,
liberty, and citizenship had no place in this new American empire.
But was this really an empire? The relations between metropole and colony
followed the rule of colonial difference: The United States treated the colonized
as inferior, both discursively and by law. Furthermore, it monopolized political
control. This was direct political control from above, constituting a formal
colonial empire by any stretch of the definition. Still, some might accept that
the United States had an overseas colonial empire but dismiss its importance
or insist that it was not properly a colonial empire.
Some commentators, for example, admit of America’s overseas empire but
then insist that it was too small to be significant or worthy of comparison
with other empires: America’s overseas colonies were “too few and too small
to constitute an overseas empire.” 170 But this is muddy thinking. A proper
comparison should not compare the U.S. empire in the late nineteenth century
with the contemporaneous British empire. It should look at the U.S. empire
in the late nineteenth century with the British empire before 1815, that is,
when the British empire too was only developing and when the British state
was only ascending in power. Doing so reveals less difference than similarity.
Before 1815, the British empire was small too. As David Fieldhouse notes in his
comparative survey, Britain’s overseas territories “could not compare in size,
wealth, population or civilization with such Spanish possessions as New Spain
or Peru. The British colonies were young . . . and in 1715 they did not cover the
eastern seaboard of North America let alone their hinterlands.” 171 Are we to
say that, because it was small, this was not an “empire”?
Even as the eighteenth century wore on, the British empire only consisted
of scattered holdings on the east coast of the United States, a few Caribbean
islands, and trading ports dotting parts of Asia and Africa (see Figure 1.4). This
was not substantially larger than America’s colonial empire in the early twen-
tieth century. That empire included Alaska, Hawaii, the Philippines, Puerto
Rico, Guam, Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Panama Canal Zone, and a host
of other areas temporarily occupied, such as Cuba, the Dominican Republic,

and Haiti. This list even excludes America’s vast western territories. An astute
article in the New York Times in 1925 was on the mark:
For the American Empire there is, indeed, no precedent. . . . Consider the unemotional
geography of it. The area of the thirteen original States was 892,135 square miles. That
was seven times the size of the United Kingdom. . . . The twentieth century is still young,
yet already this formidable Bird of Prey has swooped upon the Philippines, Panama,
Cuba, Haiti, and Porto Rico [sic]. And the territory of the United States has grown
from 900,000 miles to four times that area. We may fairly ask: What conquests had
Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar or Winston Churchill to match with these? 172
Some have pointed to the lack of a colonial office to suggest that the U.S.
empire was not really an empire proper. 173 It is true that the various over-
seas colonies were administered by different agencies in the aftermath of 1898.
Alaska and Hawaii were run by the Interior Department, which had previously
administered America’s western territories. Puerto Rico and the Philippines
were administered in the War Department by the Bureau of Insular Affairs.
The Virgin Islands, Guam, and Samoa were run by the Navy Department.
Meanwhile, the Bureau of Indian Affairs dealt with Native American issues.
Nonetheless, there was some centralization. For example, the Bureau of Insular
Affairs also had oversight over the Panama Canal Zone, the Dominican Repub-
lic occupation, and the Haitian occupation, just as it oversaw Puerto Rico and
the Philippines. Furthermore, in 1934, President Roosevelt established the Divi-
sion of Territories and Island Possessions in the Interior Department that finally
centralized territorial administration. This became the colonial office proper. 174
Even the British empire did not always have a strong centralized colonial
office. The British Colonial Office was not established until the 1850s – that is,
at the height of British supremacy and after centuries upon centuries of colonial
expansion. Before that, no proper colonial office could be found. There was
only a small office that had been part of the Secretary of State’s office for
War and Colonies. Even in the 1770s, after at least a century or more of
overseas establishments, there was no centralized colonial apparatus: “[N]o
central machinery for the government of the first British Empire existed.” 175
Instead, there were different departments with no clear jurisdictions, and they
did not even deal exclusively in colonial affairs. 176 Probably up until the 1850s
at least, Parliament had much of the power (a fact that shows how American
congressional involvement in dealing with America’s empire is not unique). 177
So if we compare the two empires during their respective periods of hegemonic
ascent (say, the United States in 1934 when the Division of Territories and
Island Possessions was established, compared with the late 1700s when Britain

had no comparable office), it is the British empire that looks wanting, not the
American empire. 178
Still, it might be suggested that if this was indeed a proper American empire,
it was nonetheless too short-lived to merit attention. Some have asserted that
“the infatuation with empire subsided as quickly as it had arisen.” 179 Suppos-
edly, Americans no longer had the stomach for colonialism, even if they once
did initially. “If for a brief period at the turn of the century things appeared
differently,” writes one political scientist, “the outlook quickly returned to
normal.” 180 If this were the case, exceptionalists would be right to brush
American colonialism under the rug, sight unseen. It was just a deviation,
the exception that proves the rule.
But what is evidence for the assertion? Part of it lies in the rise of “Wilsoni-
anism” after 1912, when the Democratic Party took charge from the Repub-
licans. The assumption is that President Woodrow Wilson represented anti-
colonialism. With his presidency, America’s true anticolonial character finally
triumphed. Did not Wilson’s famous Fourteen Points speech in 1918 famously
express America’s exceptional character? Did it not affirm self-government for
all peoples and portend a new American order in which the empires of old
would pass away to be replaced by a world of equal nation-states?
Yet, Wilsonianism did not equal anticolonialism. When President Wilson
spoke of “national self-determination,” he did not mean it for all colonized
peoples of the world. Strategically directed toward keeping the Allies in the
war, his discourse of self-determination was meant only for southeast Europe. It
was not directed at America’s own dependencies. 181 Wilson’s secretary of state,
Robert Lansing, expressly stated that Wilson’s principle of self-determination
178
179
180
181
Even if we look at the British apparatus later, in 1892, the Colonial Office listed only 2,400
personnel as running the empire, whereas the total during the previous thirty years had been
less than 1,000. This excludes the India office, which had in 1896 about 3,000 personnel, many
of whom were Indian; hence Davis and Huttenback estimate that the empire was “managed by
less than 6,000 souls!” Davis and Huttenback (1988), p. 14. It is also the case that there was
an informal colonial service in the U.S. empire whereby officials circulated through and across
the empire. Personnel from the Bureau of Insular Affairs had served in the colonies and vice-
versa. Staff in the colonial states in Puerto Rico also served in the Philippines or Guam; colonial
governors of the Virgin Islands also served in Samoa, and so on. In the imperial metropole, too,
there was circulation and career making through America’s imperial experience. Elihu Root,
who oversaw colonial governments in Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Samoa, and Guam from his
position as Secretary of War later became Secretary of State and won the Nobel Prize. William
H. Taft was the first civil governor of the Philippine Islands and later became president. The
man who would become President Harding had served as Chairman of the Senate Committee
on Territories and Insular Possessions (ca. 1916). Felix Frankfurter, a law officer in the Bureau
of Insular Affairs supervising America’s colonial empire, later became a U.S. Supreme Court
Justice. After serving as governor of the Philippines, Henry Stimson became the U.S. Secretary
of State (1929–1933) and U.S. Secretary of War (1940–5) and oversaw the expansion of U.S.
forces during the Second World War (and recommended the use of the atomic bomb on Japan).

did not apply to “races, peoples, or communities whose state of barbarism or
ignorance deprive them of the capacity to choose intelligently their political
affiliations.” 182 Presumably this included America’s overseas colonies, which is
why Wilson did little to nothing to decolonize the U.S. empire. Wilson signed
the Jones Act, giving citizenship to Puerto Ricans, but this was a practical
exigency that had no impact on Puerto Ricans’ existing colonial status. If
anything, it perpetuated their subjection as an “unincorporated territory.” 183
And two years earlier, in 1916, Wilson had initiated a military occupation of
Haiti that lasted until 1935.
In fact, the Wilson administration added to America’s colonial holdings. In
1917, the United States officially took possession of the Danish Virgin Islands.
Under the threat of force, Lansing had persuaded Denmark to sell the islands
to the United States for $25 million (the most it had ever spent on acquiring
territory). 184 Subsequently, the U.S. government controlled the islands as a
colonial dependency. The first bill introduced into the House to set up a colonial
government vested all powers in the president. In House hearings over the bill,
Congressman J. Willard Ragsdale noticed this and pointedly said to Secretary
Lansing that the bill would essentially “create an absolute monarchy, without
any supervision over the subject by either branch of Congress.” To this, Lansing
simply responded: “In the island of Guam we have that to-day, identically.” 185
As a result, the 26,000 inhabitants of the Virgin Islands, the majority of whom
were of African descent, were quickly subjected to the autocratic control of
naval governors (some of whom had served in Samoa). When criticisms of
U.S. rule surfaced from the so-called Negro press in the islands, governors
responded by imprisoning editors or deporting them as “undesirable aliens.” 186
All the while, they urged Washington to keep the existing system intact rather
than grant territorial government or statehood. Governor Sumner Kittelle told
President Warren in 1922 that “above all the white element [in the islands]
must remain in the lead and in supreme control.” 187 Such was the system
that Wilson’s presidency inaugurated, some twenty years after America’s 1898
initial foray into colonial empire. Colonialism was hardly a passing phase; it
was enduring rather than abjured.
Other evidence has been culled to suggest that America’s colonialism was
fleeting. For instance, the United States eventually granted independence to the
Philippines. According to this story, the United States took the Philippines and
other small colonies but did not really mean to stay long. So, after realizing it
didn’t have the stomach for formal European-style empire, it quickly gave its
empire away. 188 Yet this is hardly special. Britain eventually gave independence

to colonies like India. Is this to say that colonialism for Britain was a passing
phase too? 189 More to the point, the granting of independence to the Philippines
was not preordained. American officials did not plan for its independence
from the get-go; nor did they easily cut and run. When soon-to-be President
Harding was chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories and Insular
Possessions in 1916, he insisted that the United States could not withdraw from
the Philippines: “I think it is impossible for us to honorably withdraw.” 190 As
late as 1922, Franklin Roosevelt wrote to his friend Leonard Wood in the
Philippines: “The vast majority of people in this country, I have always been
certain, understand that complete independence for all these peoples is not to
be thought of for many years to come.” 191 That same year, Secretary of War
John W. Weeks spoke for himself and President Harding, saying to a New
York newspaper, “I am not in favor of granting immediate independence to
the Philippines, and the President is not.” 192 In 1927, the Philippine legislature
passed a bill asking for a plebiscite that would enable the Philippine people to
express their views on whether they should get independence. The governor
general at the time, Leonard Wood, vetoed the bill, and President Coolidge gave
his wholehearted support of the veto. 193 Nor was this against the wishes of the
American public. Gallup polls in 1938 showed that 76 percent were against
granting independence to the Philippines. 194 All the while, members of the
Philippine political class clamored for concrete moves toward independence,
sending independence missions to Washington in 1919, 1922, 1923, 1924,
and 1925. These were to no avail. 195 The U.S. government eventually did pass
the Hawes-Cutting Act in 1933, which declared that the Philippines would
receive independence in ten years’ time. 196 This, however, was against the
desires of President Hoover and his administration. And those who did support
the bill did not act on behalf of America’s anticolonial values or Wilsonian
principles. Supporters of the bill were largely farm and labor lobbies who, faced
with the Great Depression, wanted Philippine independence to halt economic
competition from Philippine products and workers. 197
This suggests that the United States has hardly been the reluctant imperialist.
To be sure, the only colony of all America’s unincorporated territories to receive
independence in this period was the Philippines. The rest – including Puerto

If we consider the actual amount of time India was subject to Crown control (as opposed to
the control of the East India Company), the time is not that different from America’s rule over
the Philippines. India was directly ruled by the Crown from 1857 to 1946.

Hoover vetoed the bill in 1932. The U.S. Senate overrode the veto in 1933. This bill did not
pass the Philippine Senate, and so the actual bill that ensured Philippine independence was the

Rico, Guam, Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands – continued to be tied to
the United States in various respects through World War II. If the empire
constructed after 1898 was merely a passing fancy, and if independence for the
Philippines is to be taken as proof, we would expect America’s other colonies
to be decolonized as well. But they were not. And this was in spite of continued
protests from the islands’ inhabitants. A petition to Congress from political
elites in Guam in 1917 requested citizenship and the end of arbitrary U.S. rule,
but it was ignored. Similar petitions were sent in 1925, 1929, 1933, 1947, and
1950. All were dismissed or ignored. 198 Similar requests emerged in Samoa,
one of which in the 1920s had led to a violent rebellion. But these were ignored
too. 199 Americans in Washington remained deaf to the voices of their imperial
subjects just as King George had been to those Americans’ forefathers.
This is one among many facets of America’s rise to global dominance that
has been too long obscured in traditional stories of American uniqueness and
exceptionalism. As seen in this chapter, there were many ways in which the
United States was imperial during its period of ascent. All of them reveal that
the U.S. empire was not a deviation from its British predecessor but a worthy
variant that often drew inspiration from it. It remains to be seen whether the
U.S. empire has been as special, unique, or different as exceptionalist thought
would have us believe.

Colonial Rules
In no other Oriental country, whether ruled by Asiatics or by Europeans, is there
anything approaching the amount of individual liberty or self-government which
our rule has brought to the Philippines.
– U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt (1902) 1
The truth is that the Americans are learning in the Philippines some of the things
with which England has become familiar in India and in Egypt.
– Editorial in the Times of London (1910) 2
The United States empire up to World War II does not easily fit the frame forged
by traditional exceptionalist thought. Contrary to exceptionalism’s portrayals,
America’s westward expansion entailed imperialism, and its overseas expansion
resulted in a formal empire stretching from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands
to the Philippines and Samoa. We have seen how, even in terms of size and
bureaucracy, this empire was not fundamentally different from Britain’s empire
during the latter’s comparable phase of development. The Council on Foreign
Relations in the 1920s noted this similarity:
Like Great Britain, we have reached the point of rapid city growth and a relatively dimin-
ishing agricultural population. In colonial possessions, in the relations of an advanced
country to countries less “civilized” or backward, in the export of capital for foreign
investment and in the competition for raw materials and foreign markets, we have
moved toward the English situation. While our problems may be different in detail,
they involve us in the study and settlement of questions often similar to those of Great
Britain. Panama has many resemblances to Suez, and our relation to Panama is in many
respects analogous to that of Great Britain to Egypt. It was constantly on the tongues of
the Englishmen at the Peace Conference that many of our new problems in the Philip-
pines resembled their own in Egypt and the Far East. The wide geographical distribution
of our territorial problems – . . . the Philippines, Alaska to Panama – puts us at last in

Patterns of Empire
the same general position that Great Britain has long occupied; that is, we impinge upon
most of the major problems of the world. 3
Yet is this to say that the U.S. empire was exactly the same as the British
empire?
The United States had an empire, but it may be the case that it was special
and unique nonetheless – perhaps even exceptional. Proponents and practition-
ers of America’s overseas empire often made this very claim. While admitting
that the United States was an empire, they insisted that the new overseas
empire would be distinct for its benign and liberal treatment of colonized
subjects. “In no other Oriental country, whether ruled by Asiatics or by Euro-
peans,” declared President Roosevelt in 1902, “is there anything approach-
ing the amount of individual liberty or self-government which our rule has
brought to the Philippines.” 4 The United States, in other words, may have
seized colonies, but it nonetheless treated its colonial peoples with a unique lib-
eral approach. This view persists in exceptionalist thought today. Presumably,
what makes the United States exceptional is not its lack of colonial empire but
its particular type of colonial empire. Traditional exceptionalism represses the
word empire, but this revised exceptionalism proclaims a distinctly American
imperialism – a unique liberal empire or “liberal imperialism.” Let us call it
liberal exceptionalism.
There are three steps to this mode of thought. First, admit that the United
States forged an overseas colonial empire at the turn of the twentieth century.
The fact that the United States took the Philippines and other islands cannot be
easily dismissed. Second, while admitting empire, demonstrate that this empire
was uniquely liberal and benign. Americans took overseas colonies but ended
up democratizing them, teaching other peoples the ways of self-government,
and spreading American doctrines of freedom and liberty. 5 Finally, explain
why the U.S. empire had this liberal character by reference to America’s demo-
cratic traditions, values, and institutions. The U.S. empire has been distinctly
democratizing, liberal, and tutelary rather than repressive because that is how
America does things. It is a reflection of America’s unique style and national
character. 6
The purpose of this chapter is to further interrogate this version of excep-
tionalism. Might liberal exceptionalist thought best capture the distinctiveness
of American empire? The chapter begins by discussing liberal exceptionalism’s
model: the Philippines. Scholars and contemporaries alike have referred to U.S.
colonialism in the Philippines as the example par excellence of liberal excep-
tionalism. As we will see, this is not without reason. But although we begin in

the Philippines, the rest of the chapter looks elsewhere. A proper interrogation
of liberal exceptionalism demands a wider comparative view. Accordingly, the
chapter begins in the Philippines but later takes turns through Puerto Rico,
Guam, and India – and other places in between. The tour will show us the lim-
its of liberal exceptionalism. Where colonialism does appear so exceptional,
this chapter will show us why. Ultimately we will arrive at a working theory
of colonial regimes and an explanation of the diversity within empires that
exceptionalist discourse covers up.
Liberal Exceptionalism and the Philippines
As seen in Chapter 1, when the United States acquired its overseas colonial
empire at the turn of the twentieth century, many Americans at the time were
ready to admit that the United States had a new empire. “Empire” was not
necessarily a dirty word. But although many Americans admitted empire, they
also crafted a distinctly American imperial identity. Scholars, statesmen, and
officials proposed that the United States was better suited than Europeans for
taking up the imperial mantle. Herein lie the origins of liberal exceptionalism.
Notice the writings of Bernard Moses (an academic from California who later
served in the Philippines) and Woodrow Wilson (then an academic whom colo-
nial officials often cited). Moses reviewed the history of British colonialism in
Asia and Africa and found that it had been “reckless and tyrannical.” Because
of England’s monarchical tradition, it had failed to live up to the promise
of developing the “lesser races.” In contrast, the United States was special.
Because of its unique democratic history, Americans were endowed with a lib-
eral character unmatched by any other. Thus, only the United States would be
able to construct a “wise and beneficient [sic] governmental authority over a
rude people,” and offer its imperial subjects an “impulse and guidance toward
the attainment of a higher form of life and larger liberty.” 7 The United States
would be an empire, but unlike other empires it would use its power benevo-
lently, taking up the task of transforming, uplifting, and democratizing foreign
peoples. “If America has any mission outside of her continental limits, it is
not to preserve among less developed peoples such institutions and customs as
make for bondage and social stagnation, but to put in their place the ideas that
have made for freedom, and the laws by which this nation has been enabled to
preserve its freedom.” 8
Wilson similarly insisted that democracy was an essential part of America’s
being, a “thing of principle and custom and [our] nature” that is “admirably
expressed” in “our institutions.” 9 This American character derived from Amer-
ica’s historical ties to Britain, according to Wilson, but because of America’s
lack of monarchy and feudalism it was more purely democratic. For this
7

Patterns of Empire
reason, the United States was not only a more perfect union, but also a more
perfect liberal empire. Only the United States could “moderate the process [of
imperialism] in the interests of liberty; to impart to the peoples thus driven out
upon the road of change . . . our principles of self-help; teach them order and
self-control; impart to them . . . the drill and habit of law and obedience.” 10
The model of this liberal exceptionalism soon appeared: the Philippines. Of
course, proponents of liberal exceptionalism could not point to the Philippine-
American War as evidence for America’s special liberal imperialism. The bru-
tality of the war betrayed the self-proclaimed image. Rather, liberal exception-
alists pointed to colonial policies on the ground as the war waned. The idea, as
President McKinley put it, was to “develop, to civilize, to educate, to train in the
science of self-government.” 11 This was a mission of so-called democratic tute-
lage. The United States would subdue the rebellion but then institute a colonial
regime that would provide elections and political offices so that Filipinos would
learn the ways of democratic self-government. In place of bullets would come
ballots. President McKinley’s instructions to the Philippine Commission (who
were to help plan and run the new colonial government) thus insisted that the
commission should institute policies that would aid in the Filipinos’ political
“development” according to the “traditions” and political ideas “from which
we have benefited.” This is what would distinguish American empire from the
“tyrannical” empires of European powers. 12
On the ground, the commission put the plan into action. They insisted that
theirs would be a tutelary government whereby the colonized would receive
an “education” in the ways of American-style political ideas, institutions, and
values under America’s “strong and guiding hand.” 13 In part, this involved
building a public school system that would offer civics classes for the “igno-
rant” and “credulous” masses. 14 Another part of the project was a so-called
practical political education for the more powerful strata of society. 15 The
presumption was that the Filipinos, as a result of centuries of Spanish rule,
had not yet learned how to govern themselves in accordance with the prin-
ciples of democracy. “They are as incapable of forming a just conception of
civil liberty,” said Senator William Dudley Foulke of Indiana, “as we are of
understanding the institutions which prevail upon the planet Mars. How can
they know it when they have never seen anything like it?” 16 The Filipino elite
were capable of learning; they had just not yet learned. A policy of “practical
political education” would fill the presumed gap, giving the elite the civilizing
influences that, supposedly, Spanish rule had not provided.

The colonial state itself was to serve the educating process. In small towns
across the islands, American authorities first permitted elective offices and
other minor municipal posts to be filled by Filipinos. Bernard Moses wrote in
his diary: “[W]e are trying to make the town governments schools of politics in
which the people may acquire some knowledge of self-government, and make
their first attempts in political self-control.” 17 Governor Taft and other officials
like Dean Worcester often referred to Tocqueville to claim that the municipal
governments would “afford a school of politics for the education of the people
in the duties of good citizenship.” 18 American authorities also constructed a
civil service to give native bureaucrats “a political education which will show
them the possibility of the honest administration of government.” 19 Later, in
1907, the commission established a national legislative assembly, the Philippine
Assembly, manned by elected Filipino officials. This was to allow Filipino legis-
lators to “receive instruction in the principles and methods of government . . . in
the practical school of experience” and to learn such “lessons” as the “Amer-
ican method of a strong executive separate from the assembly.” 20 Elections
with an initially restricted suffrage were to aid the ostensible curriculum.
We must not be mistaken. This was still a colonial government. Filipinos
could vote and participate, but American authorities, appointed by the U.S.
president, retained ultimate control. The Philippine Assembly was more like a
lower house, not a full Congress with two houses; American authorities retained
veto power. But although this was a colonial government, it was nonetheless a
distinct tutelary colonial government. U.S. authorities were in charge, but they
were to offer “object lessons” in the ways of good government. The stated goal
was that the colonized would participate and learn and would be ultimately
transformed into American types – even if they were not to be transformed into
“Americans” proper. By being granted some amount of governmental parti-
cipation, Filipinos would get the proper training and experience in American
styled-government so that they might one day rule themselves. Colonial policies
and the very structure of the colonial state followed from this overarching
principle. With elections, political offices, a legislature, and other semblances
of democracy – this was a seemingly liberal and unique colonial state.
It is exactly because of these features of U.S. colonialism that liberal excep-
tionalists upheld the Philippines as their proof and model. William Washburn,
chairman of the Philippine Civil Service Board, insisted that U.S. colonial-
ism was better than British colonialism because of its unique liberal features:
“[N]ever before has there been instituted a scheme of colonial government so
beneficent and humanitarian. . . . There is no precedent in history.” 21 William

general, claimed that whereas European colonialisms were driven by “the profit
motive,” American rule in the Philippines was guided by “altruism” and was
“designed solely for the welfare of the Philippine people.” Forbes even claimed
that when European rulers later engaged in civilizing missions, they simply “fol-
lowed the example set by the United States.” 22 In the 1930s, historian Julius
Pratt added: “Probably no group of men in history ever took so seriously the
task of administering colonies in the interest of their inhabitants as the best of
the American officials . . . [who] worked to bring the Filipinos to a higher level
of health, prosperity, education, and political capacity.” “The Philippines,” he
concluded, “constitute Exhibit A among projects of benevolent imperialism.” 23
Liberal exceptionalist discourse today continues this long tradition. Some
political scientists have claimed that America’s special “mission” has been
to “export democracy” to the world and point to the Philippines as one
of their examples. “Compared to the Europeans,” says Stanley Karnow in
his Pulitzer Prize–winning book, “the Americans were far more liberal polit-
ically. . . . [They] encouraged elections soon after their arrival, so that the Fil-
ipinos had a national legislature, the first in Asia, as early as 1907. . . . This
was a time when the British, despite their own democratic creed, were detain-
ing Indian dissidents without trial and the French, for all their dedication to
the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity, were summarily executing
Vietnamese nationalists.” 24 President George W. Bush played the theme too.
In October of 2003, he visited Manila and gave a speech to the Philippine
Congress, referring to the Philippines as “America’s oldest ally in Asia” and
suggesting that America was responsible for making the Philippines into the
“the first democratic nation in Asia.” “America,” he said, “is proud of its part
in the great story of the Filipino people.” 25
Comparing Colonialisms
So how might we assess liberal exceptionalism? It would seem difficult to refute
the fact that the U.S. regime in the Philippines had a tutelary character. The
United States did set up local governments and elections and gave Filipinos
some amount of participation in the government. Even when historians attack
liberal exceptional discourse about the Philippines because it seems to promote
U.S. imperialism, they do not refute the facts it enlists. For instance, the Wall
Street Journal writer Max Boot refers to tutelage in the Philippines to claim
that “compared with the grasping old imperialism of the past, America’s ‘liberal
imperialism’ pursues far different, and more ambitious, goals. It aims to instill

democracy in lands that have known tyranny.” 26 In response, critics charge
Boot with promoting U.S. imperialism but not with getting the facts wrong.
One such critic concedes: “As for the claims that Filipinos fared much better
under U.S. imperialism than their counterparts elsewhere did under European
colonialism, and that the Philippines was the first Asian state to establish a
national legislature (1907), all are true.” 27 Faced with the fact of American
colonialism’s tutelary elections, native offices, and promotion of eventual self-
government in the Philippines, it would seem that even the most virulent critics
of exceptionalist thought have few if any counterarguments to make.
Lacking amidst these debates, however, is a comparative understanding. A
comparison would be telling. The underlying claim of liberal exceptionalism
is that America’s colonial regime in the Philippines was fundamentally dif-
ferent from other colonialisms. A colonial state replete with elective political
offices and liberal native participation; a program of training and teaching
colonized subjects the ways of democracy; the idea of civilizing and uplifting;
and the rhetoric of eventual self-government – all such things, manifest in the
Philippines, were supposedly unique to U.S. colonialism. But was this really so
unique?
British observers were nonplussed. In 1902, a London Times article com-
mented on a report regarding the Philippines by U.S. Secretary of War Elihu
Root. Root’s report had boasted that the U.S. colonial administration was
“critically involved in creating a good government” in the islands. It pointed
out that the United States had set up municipal offices with elections and native
participation, that it was constructing a public education system, and that it
had set up a civil service – all the usual things that presumably distinguish
U.S. colonialism from other types of colonialism. But the Times article saw
all of this as evidence of similarity to British colonialism rather than differ-
ence: “This outline and the extracts from the report [of Root] will show how
completely the United States has departed from the old Spanish methods of
colonial government and how closely it has assimilated to those employed in
British colonies.” 28 A 1910 piece in the Times made similar points. It claimed
that America’s experience in the Philippines was little else than a reproduction
of Britain’s own experience: “[T]he more the American lives in the Philippines
and comes to understand the Orient the better he comprehends, and the more
he is drawn to sympathize with, the work which Great Britain has done, and
is doing, in the world.” 29
What was all this about? Coming from British observers, we may rightly
wonder if the boasts about British benevolence had any substance. But at the
very least, they suggest that we should take a closer look at British colonial-
ism in order to assess the comparable uniqueness of U.S. colonialism in the

Philippines. 30 Contemporary proponents of America’s liberal exceptionalism
themselves looked to the British example, if only to craft a difference. As
we have seen, Moses and Wilson were among the proponents who classified
the United States as different from Britain. So too were policy advisors like
the members of the Schurman Commission (named after Jacob Schurman,
the head of the commission). In their report to President McKinley in 1899,
the commission concluded that, in places like India, British rule had been too
autocratic. “The British Government [in India] has entire control of legislation
and the administration is carried on by officers under the control of that Gov-
ernment. . . . [A]s the government is imposed upon the people from without, it
is inimical to the habit of self-government, and this . . . is its fatal defect. For
this reason it must be rejected as a model for the Philippines.” 31
So who was right? Surely pro-exceptionalists like Moses, Wilson, or the
Schurman Commission can be forgiven for highlighting Britain’s tyrannical
exercises of power over colonies like India. The violent response to the Indian
Mutiny from 1857 to 1859, when India was still under the official control of the
East India Company, is but one indication of the brutality and terror of British
rule. On the other hand, although pro-exceptionalists may have been correct
in pointing to British tyranny, they were not entirely right in denying British
liberalism. There is enough in the history of British rule in India to suggest that
British colonialism had not been as “inimical to the habit of self-government”
as the Schurman Commission believed.
In fact, just as Americans violently repressed the Philippine revolution and
followed it up with tutelary institutions for the defeated Filipinos, so too did
the British follow up their repression of the Indian Mutiny with widened par-
ticipation for Indians and the construction of an incipient tutelary state. In
1861, soon after the British government declared sovereignty over India upon
taking control from the British East India Company, Parliament passed the
Indian Councils Act. The act changed the nature of the Legislative Council
that had been established earlier under Company rule. Although the council
remained advisory, providing support and input to the governor general, its
membership was enlarged to include Indians. The first session of the council
under the new act included the Maharaja of Patiala, Dinkar Rao, and Deo
Narain Singh. Not long afterward, British officials took steps to decentralize
local government functions, giving Indian officials increasing fiscal responsibil-
ity and control over local services. The first result was the creation of municipal
governments across India. Whereas British district commissioners previously –
during Company rule – ran the show, the new municipal governments were run
largely by native Indians who were put in charge of local taxation and services
such as roads, education, and health. 32 Subsequent developments saw more

devolution. In 1870, Lord Mayo, who had recently been appointed Viceroy of
India by Disraeli, passed a Resolution on Provincial Finance that decentralized
financial functions even more. 33 Lord Mayo even set up local elections in some
districts, such as in the Central Provinces and the North-West Provinces. This
was decades before Americans established elections in the Philippines.
Admittedly, these steps were cautious and limited. The Indians chosen to
serve on the Legislative Council were picked for their “loyalty and their con-
servative sentiments.” 34 And Lord Mayo’s devolution policies were partly dic-
tated by practical necessity. As the British Crown had just inherited a colonial
regime from the East India Company in dire financial straits, devolving respon-
sibility for local finances was fiscally expedient. Still, the effect was to give the
colonized participation in governance, pushing the colonial state in India in a
more liberal direction than American exceptionalist discourse allows. 35 In fact,
officials often fashioned their policies in tutelary rhetoric, suggesting that they
would serve an educating purpose leading to eventual self-government. 36 Lord
Mayo said his policies would “afford opportunities for the development of self-
government, for strengthening municipal institutions, and for the association
of natives and Europeans, to a greater extent than before, in the administration
of affairs.” 37 He further explained in private correspondence:
I have gradually to commence the establishment of native municipal institutions. . . .
Were we to quit India tomorrow we should leave whole Provinces in which would not
be found a man capable of administrating [sic] the affairs of a small district. It can only
be a work of time; and, as in other countries, to the growth of municipal institutions
has generally been traced the powers of self-government, so in India do I believe that we
shall find the best assistance from natives in our administration . . . by quietly entrusting
as many as we can with local responsibility, and instructing them in the management
of their own district affairs. 38
In fact, this discourse of native capacity and tutelary self-government extended
back to the 1850s, when some Parliament members had clamored for native
participation in the Legislative Council. 39 In 1858, Gladstone held that “India
is to be governed for India and as far as may be proved practicable by India.” 40
In the 1860s, men like Henry Fawcett and John Bright in the House of Com-
mons insisted that Indians should be given more control over the reins of the

Americans and the American governor general wielded final say.

state. Bright held the view that British rule over India was only temporary
and hoped that British policies would be aimed at preparing Indians for full
self-government. 41
Evident here is a strong liberal tradition that held that human nature was the
same everywhere and that people could be transformed if need be. No doubt,
this view could at once legitimate empire and repudiate it. 42 For their part,
British liberals in the nineteenth century applied it to India to justify continued
colonial control while also pointing to a more tutelary type of rule. Indians
were to take part in governance so that they could learn to eventually govern
themselves. Governor General John Lawrence was positive about the Indians’
capacity for some amount of self-government. “The people of this country,” he
said, “are perfectly capable of administering their own local affairs.” 43 Samuel
Laing, who had helped initiate the decentralization process, was similarly pos-
itive. Outlining his fiscal plans for colonial governance in 1862, he said, “India
is not altogether devoid of that spirit of self-government which characterizes
the Anglo-Saxon.” 44 The same view of Indian capacity had been expressed in
James Mill’s classic History of British India. Mill had argued that Indians were
not interminably inferior; rather they could undergo “stages of progress,” get
“training” in self-government, and develop the “active self-helping character”
necessary for self-rule. 45
This liberal colonialism (which, like the American approach to the Philip-
pines, treated Indians and India as potentially self-governing) was only one
approach among others. An alternative was simply to maintain the status quo,
ruling through local princes who commanded obedience from putatively docile
Indian subjects. That approach implied a different view of Indians than the
liberal one; it implied they were naturally and interminably inferior, hence
incapable of self-government. 46 But the liberal view was dominant and persis-
tent enough to be a serious contender. It was strong enough for journals like
The Economist to declare, in 1857 at the height of the Indian Mutiny, that the
British people had to choose “whether in future . . . we are to rule our Asiatic
subjects with strict and generous justice, wisely and beneficently, as their natu-
ral and indefensible superiors . . . or whether we are to regard [them] . . . as our
equal fellow citizens, fit to be entrusted with the functions of self-government,
ripe (or to be ripened) for British institutions, likely to appreciate the bless-
ings of our rule, and, therefore, to be gradually prepared, as our own working
classes are preparing, for a full participation in the privileges of representative
assemblies, trial by jury, and all the other palladia of English liberty.” 47

British colonialism oscillated between these two approaches. 48 From 1876
to 1880, when the Conservative Party led by Disraeli appointed Lord Lytton
to India, the conservative approach was remounted. Lytton was more intent
on securing India’s frontiers and enlisting the support of Indian notables (the
“powerful aristocracy”) than expanding opportunities for self-government. 49
Yet the liberal option remained potent in the late nineteenth century. Its clearest
expression came with Lytton’s successor, Lord Ripon.
Ripon had served in the House of Lords in the 1850s. Appointed to India by
W. E. Gladstone, he immediately embarked on a series of liberal reforms. He
repealed the Vernacular Press Act that Lord Lytton had previously imposed.
The act had meant to restrict nationalist inflammations in the vernacular
press; Ripon felt this was antithetical to the development of representative
institutions. 50 He also appointed the very first Indian to serve as acting chief
justice at High Court. In conjunction with the Ilbert Bill that had passed under
Ripon’s watch, this meant that British planters, settlers, or any citizens could
find themselves in court to be tried by an Indian. As Ripon explained to Glad-
stone, this was all part of his policy “of governing India for herself and not for
Englishmen.” 51
Ripon’s other major advance was to more firmly institutionalize the elective
principle for local governments. Lord Mayo had allowed for limited elections
in certain districts, but Ripon now insisted that they be spread throughout
India. Ripon had originally hoped to introduce elections for the Legislative
Council, making it more akin to British Parliament and thereby advancing
“the political education of the people . . . along the same road of extended
self-government.” 52 But as this idea was considered too radical in London,
Ripon turned to local elections as an alternative step. He explained in a memo
that introducing local elections across India was part of his plan to “extend
the principle of popular representation and . . . make a larger use of it as an
instrument of political education of the Indians.” 53 His Resolution on Local
Self-Government of May 18, 1882, was the result. It required that at least two-
thirds of members on all local legislative bodies should be elected nonofficials
(i.e. not from the civil service), thereby enabling more Indians to hold office
and vote for their own members. It further legislated that chief executive offi-
cers should meddle as little as possible with the local legislative bodies, thereby
giving them ample autonomy for “the purposes of training the natives to man-
age their own affairs.” Ripon modeled this part of the resolution on municipal
bodies in England. 54
Ripon’s reforms were received positively by educated Indian leaders like
S. N. Banerjea, G. K. Gokhale, Pheroze Shah Mehta, and Raja Peari Mohan

Mukerji. 55 The Committee of the Bombay Branch of East India, led by
Vishwanath N. Mandlik, further offered gratitude. In 1883, the committee
addressed Ripon’s ally Sir E. Baring in 1883, who had helped Ripon with the
policy:
We gratefully acknowledge the action of the Government of India in carrying out
the principle of entrusting Natives of India with a constantly increasing share in the
administration of the country. . . . In the same spirit, we feel great pleasure in being
able to testify to the value of the assistance you have rendered in the noble work of
securing to the people the right of local self-government, a measure which needs only to
be loyally persevered in on the broad and generous principles laid down in the famous
resolution of the present Government of India, to render it the vehicle of immense good
to the people, by the gradual development of their public spirit and the steady growth
of their political education. 56
This is not to say that Ripon’s policies were entirely progressive. 57 His
election policy put high restrictions on the suffrage. In some provinces, the
municipal electorate was less than 2 percent of the urban population. In Ben-
gal, it was closer to 5 percent. 58 Therefore, only the more privileged of the
population held office. 59 But the point here is to offer a comparison with U.S.
tutelary programs in the Philippines, not to laud or denigrate Ripon’s politics.
The comparison reveals more similarity than exceptionalist discourse admits.
As Ripon’s policy put high restrictions on suffrage, so did American officials
in the Philippines also impose high restrictions. For Philippine municipal elec-
tions, the electorate was initially restricted to the point where only 2.4 percent
of the population could vote. 60 In terms of office holding, American rule in
the Philippines was hardly more open to native participation. Indians had a
surprisingly large presence in the colonial government. From 1867 onward,
the percentage of natives in the highest paid offices of public service slowly
increased from 65 percent in 1867 to 67 in 1877 and to 71 percent in 1887. 61
In the Philippines, although exceptionalists boast of wide Filipino participation
in government, the percentages are not radically different. In 1903, the per-
centage of non-Americans in the higher administrative posts of the government
was close to 72 percent. Over the course of the subsequent decade, it fell to

as low as 66 percent. 62 Perhaps the only major difference between American
tutelary elections and offices in the Philippines and those institutionalized by
the British in India is that the British enacted their policies decades before the
United States took the Philippines. America’s putatively liberal colonialism in
the Philippines was not as unprecedented as exceptionalism’s proponents insist.
The Diversity of Empire
Is it fair, however, to compare U.S. rule in the Philippines with British rule
in India? It might be that British liberalism in India was unique rather than
representative of Britan’s colonial empire. To be sure, Britain enacted a very
different type of colonial regime in other territories. Fiji is instructive. After
he was appointed as the first governor in 1874, Arthur Hamilton Gordon
instituted a colonial state in Fiji that looked nothing like liberal British India.
There were no local governments modeled after British towns and no elec-
tions or councils meant to be imitations of British councils at home. Instead,
Gordon’s goal was to keep intact “customary” life in Fiji. Part of this meant
constructing a colonial state that deployed the preexisting system of Fijian
chieftanship. The chiefs would rule local populations according to so-called
native tradition; British officials would simply dictate from above. The goal
was preservation rather than education or transformation. Native institutions,
customs, and structures were to be maintained rather than adjusted or trans-
formed. As Gordon himself later put it, his goal was to “abstain from seeking
hastily to replace native institutions by unreal imitations of European models,”
and was instead meant to “seize the spirit in which native institutions had been
framed.” The avowed goal was “to preserve the traditional laws and customs,
to maintain in authority the local chiefs, and in all possible ways to utilize the
existing native organization.” 63 Thus, rather than try to force an “affectation
of European ways and habits,” British rule should “maintain existing native
laws and customs.” 64
This was a regime of “indirect rule.” It was closer to the conservative option
in India and was akin to the strategy of ruling through Indian princes. The
imperative: Do not transform native institutions but rather preserve and use
them. Of course, exactly what was “native” or not often had to be invented
on the spot by local chiefs or sometimes by British authorities themselves.
But whether truly native or not, the point is that British officials made an
effort to sustain what was perceived as “native” and “traditional” rather than
replace them with Anglo-British culture. Nicholas Thomas describes this type
of colonial governmentality: “[T]his was essentially a segregationist rather than
an assimilationist vision: the emphasis was on the difference between European

Patterns of Empire
and essentialized African or Fijian cultures, which were not to be subsumed to
a European model but sustained in their distinctiveness.” 65
Indirect rule was later popularized for British Africa by Lord Lugard. As
Governor Donald Cameron in Tanganyika articulated Lugard’s idea: “It is our
duty to do everything in our power to develop the native on lines which will not
westernize him and turn him into a bad imitation of a European.” 66 The result
was what Mamdani calls “decentralized despotism”: a modality of rule that
entailed fabrications of what was native and customary and also a complex
hierarchy of rules and orders dictated by British officials to be carried out by
chiefs on the spot. Chiefs, for example, had to supply forced labor for defense,
public works, or other “needs of the colony” – as the 1891 Natal Native Code
dictated. 67 The chiefs themselves had little choice in these matters: Their posi-
tion depended on gaining continued acceptance from British authorities. The
British even eventually abolished any sense of hereditary succession in such
positions. All chiefs in administrative positions were appointed and subject to
approval and dismissal by British authorities. In Rhodesia in the 1920s, it was
expressly determined by the courts that the governor general had the “unqual-
ified right to appoint who[m]soever he considered suitable to chiefship” such
that hereditary rights of succession were effectively “abolished.” 68
Given this form of governance, it is obvious that liberal British rule in India
was not representative of British colonial forms as a whole. Within the British
empire, there was a continuum of possible modalities of rule – a multiplicity
rather than a single type of colonialism: There was no single “rule” of British
colonial rule. The Duke of Newcastle acknowledged this diversity in his tes-
timony to the House of Commons in 1861. It would be an “entire folly,” he
noted, to think “that one rigid rule can be applied to the whole of the colonies
of the empire.” The theory that one policy suits all “will not bear examination,
nor can it be carried into practice.” 69
But if it is folly to assume a singular “style” or policy across the British
empire, so too is it folly to assume uniformity across the American empire.
Put differently, if we cannot take the liberal reformists’ policies in India as
representative of a distinct or uniform British style of colonialism, neither
should we take the Philippines as representative of a uniform U.S. style. The
problem with liberal exceptionalist thought is that it fails to heed this warning.
One of the underlying assumptions of liberal exceptionalism is that there is
indeed such a thing as a single national style of colonial governance; a singular
rule for all of America’s colonial rules. To say that the U.S. empire is special
or unique for its colonial governance is to assume that there is a uniformity to
colonial practice and forms across the U.S. empire – a unique type. If there was

not, then we could not pinpoint a type of American empire that was different
from other empires, much less an exceptional type.
It follows that exceptionalism would be compelled to assume that the United
States enacted liberal tutelary regimes in all of its colonies; not just in the
Philippines. And this is true if we look at Puerto Rico. There, colonial policies
were very similar to those in the Philippines. Although later citizenship laws
would differ, and although the Philippines would later become independent
whereas Puerto Rico remained tied to the United States, the early years of U.S.
rule in Puerto Rico brought the same sort of tutelary colonial state: a large-scale
public school system, elections, local offices, a national legislative assembly, and
a rhetoric of “political education.” 70 However, things look entirely different
when we consider two other U.S. colonies acquired around the same time as
Puerto Rico and the Philippines (and which, unlike Hawaii or Alaska, were
also declared “unincorporated territories”): Guam and Samoa. In neither of
these colonies did authorities endeavor to cast the colonized in metropolitan
molds; talk of tutelage was markedly absent.
Something of this difference is seen when we look at the public school
systems. As late as 1920 there was only one state-funded school in Samoa.
Although Guam saw a few more, neither saw the kind of educational program
carried out in the Philippines or Puerto Rico. 71 The criticism of one traveler
was acute: “We have gone quite mad over education in the Philippines, and not
quite mad enough over Guam.” 72 More telling are the forms of colonial gover-
nance. Both Guam and Samoa were put into the hands of the Navy Department.
In turn, commanders of the naval base assumed the role of colonial governor
responsible for devising policies, programs, and all legislation. In Samoa, the
result was a form of rule first laid down by Governor Tilley and kept in exis-
tence for several decades. Tilley divided the islands into administrative districts
corresponding to what he took to be the “ancient” sociopolitical divisions, and
he appointed hereditary native chiefs to administer them. The goal was not to
uproot local forms of authority but keep them intact, preserving rather than
transforming Samoan “customs.” Governors in Guam structured their colonial
regime similarly. Guam did not have hereditary chiefs, but under Spanish rule
it had had native district officials known as gobernadorcillos (or “little gover-
nors”). American authorities did not then try to transform the system. Instead,
they maintained it by reappointing the gobernadorcillos as “commissioners.”
Thus, in stark contrast to the Philippines or Puerto Rico, local leaders were
not chosen through American-style elections. There was no talk of “practical
political education”; the state was not fashioned as a “school of politics.” As
one historian notes, “political conditions hardly changed at all” from Spanish
to American rule. 73 If anything, the movement was in reverse. During Spanish

rule, the position of gobernadorcillo had been elective (albeit through a very
restrictive suffrage), but American officials abolished these elections entirely. 74
Successive colonial rulers in Guam and Samoa thus maintained control auto-
cratically – a type of personal rule that concentrated legislative, executive, and
judicial functions in the American governor. 75 No effort was made to instill
the “principles” of American governance such as the separation of powers,
much less the ideas of America’s beloved democracy. The difference was not
lost on astute contemporary observers. Pratt heralded American rule in the
Philippines as “exhibit A” of “benevolent imperialism,” but he also noted that
“elsewhere there is less to be proud of and more to deplore.” It is “true that
naval governors [in Samoa and Guam] have permitted native life to go on with
no great amount of interference,” but this “is a negative kind of beneficence,
not the strenuous bearing of the burden sung by Kipling.” 76
In short, contrary to Moses’s claim that America’s “mission” was not to
“preserve social stagnation” but rather uplift and transform, American author-
ities in Guam and Samoa aimed for preservation. Calling this “indirect rule” is
on the spot. In fact, Tilley’s model for his government in Samoa, as he said him-
self, was British indirect rule in Fiji. American colonial governance in Samoa
was decidedly not inspired by American traditions, territorial governments at
home, or even Native American reservations but rather British colonialism. 77
The American version of indirect rule was no less arbitrary or tyrannical
than its British precedent, a fact not lost on the colonized peoples. In 1910, the
naval commandant in Guam discovered an anonymous handbill that had been
circulating among the Chamorros. It read in part:
Salam! Salam!
I’m the Governor of Guam,
I’m glorious and great,
I’m a pampered potentate,
So I am.
I run things as a I please
Get down on your knees,
I’m the ruler of the tightest little island in the seas,
That’s me.
Those who do not like me,
I shut up or send away,
I’m a wonder and I know it, –
Of the thirty-third degree.
Behold! Behold!
I’m fearless and I’m bold.
I’m the government, the law;
Kings refer to me with awe,
So I’m told. 78

In Samoa during the 1920s, more direct resistance emerged. Samoan chiefs
had been complaining about the copra tax and had been wondering where the
money went. The people, reported one officer, were concerned “that the Gov-
ernment was stealing the money of the Samoan people.” 79 Complaints about
other policies, such as a ban on marriage between Samoans and whites, also
aroused complaint. These grievances culminated in an anti-navy movement
known as the Mau rebellion. The rebellion, which had parallels in neighboring
German Samoa, ended up in a truce, but the causes of the rebellion remained.
The Mau had not only called for an end to certain policies by the naval com-
manders, they had also asked that Congress establish a civil government and
grant the islanders citizenship. 80
If arbitrary rule was displeasing to some, however, little was done in
response. Requests from Guam throughout the first half of the twentieth
century to replace military rule with a civil government fell on deaf ears in
Washington. 81 This meant that naval commanders in Guam and Samoa could
continue to rule the islands autocratically. By not establishing a civil govern-
ment to replace the military government, Congress essentially let the navy do as
it pleased. This was not accidental neglect: The executive branch often pushed
for such congressional inaction, thereby ensuring that the islands would remain
under its direct control. “If left alone Congress will probably do nothing about
providing a form of government for the Islands [of Guam],” wrote Secretary
of State Elihu Root to the Secretary of the Navy in 1905. “[T]he inactivity of
Congress must be deemed to be an approval of the continuance of the existing
government. It is very desirable that this should be so.” 82
The Provinciality of American Empire
The treatment of Guam and Samoa starkly reveals the limits of liberal excep-
tionalist thought. Liberal exceptionalism contends that the U.S. colonial empire
was uniquely liberal and benign, democratizing its colonial subjects and train-
ing them for self-government. Not only does this presume that other empires
failed to enact tutelary regimes or policies, it also presumes a uniformity to colo-
nial practice across the U.S. empire. The diversity of colonial regimes belies this
notion. However, if there was such diversity within both the U.S. and British
empires, what accounts for it? This is worth pursuing.
Liberal exceptionalism tries to account for colonial regimes with a
metropolitan-centered explanation. In this explanation, colonial policies and
practices abroad reflect metropolitan characteristics at home. To wit: Amer-
ica’s presumably unique liberal colonialism in places like the Philippines reflects
America’s own liberal institutions and political culture. As Susan Carruthers
observes of this reasoning: “If the U.S. was uniquely virtuous . . . then it stood

Patterns of Empire
to reason that American modes of imperial governance must be reflective of
that virtuosity, both in the uplifting ends to which U.S. interventions aspired,
and the lightness of touch with which American agents pursued them.” 83 We
can now see the problem with this account. If national style, character, or
values determine an empire’s colonial forms, then we would expect similarity
in colonial forms within each empire as well as marked differences between
empires in colonial forms. As just seen, neither the U.S. nor the British empires
conform to this expectation. The question remains: What explains variation
in colonialism within empires? Why, for instance, did the United States enact
in the Philippines and Puerto Rico a tutelary regime but did not in Guam or
Samoa?
A better explanation would not focus on the metropole, national charac-
ter, or national styles. It would rather provincialize empire and look at what
happened at the point of power’s application. 84 Note, for example, that when
contemplating and crafting colonial policy, American rulers were less often
dictated by metropolitan values or traditions than by the legitimacy of their
rule to colonized groups. This is most evident among the early U.S. officials in
the Philippines who faced armed resistance from Philippine insurgents. In order
to win the insurgents over to the U.S. side and better establish U.S. control, the
Schurman Commission suggested that they needed to demonstrate their benev-
olence. To quell resistance, the regime had “to create a situation where those in
favor of peace can safely say so, and can argue with their brethren in the field
not only that our intentions are good but, by pointing to accomplished facts,
show the advantage of accepting our authority.” 85 Even replacing the existing
military government with civil government “would do more than any other
single occurrence to reconcile the Filipinos to American sovereignty.” 86 The
commission not only claimed that winning hearts and minds would help quell
resistance and establish American rule, they likewise insisted that it would
help sustain it in the long run. “Americans and Filipinos will have to trust
each other,” Schurman wrote to Secretary of State John Hay in Washington.
“[W]hile the Filipino stops at nothing nor thinks of death when influenced by
hatred, resentment or revenge, he is much moved by sympathy and generosity
of [a] powerful superior, whose power he has felt. Believe magnanimity our
safest, cheapest, and best policy with Filipinos.” 87
Even in the territories where armed revolution was absent, U.S. officials were
concerned about legitimating their occupation. In Samoa, the Assistant Secre-
tary of the Navy, Charles Allen (who later governed Puerto Rico), instructed

the first commander in charge of local policy: “While your position as com-
mandant will invest you with authority over the islands embraced within the
limits of the state, you will at all times exercise care to conciliate and cultivate
friendly relations with the natives. A simple, straightforward method of admin-
istration, such as to win and hold the confidence of the people, is expected of
you.” This clause was repeated in the orders to every subsequent governor
of the islands. 88 Similarly, in Guam, President McKinley’s instructions to the
first appointed governor read: “[I]t will be the duty of the military comman-
der to announce and proclaim in the most public manner that we come, not
as invaders or conquerors, but as friends. . . . [I]t should be the earnest and
paramount aim of the naval administration to win the confidence, respect and
affection of the inhabitants of the Island of Guam.” 89
We see here a logic of legitimation at work rather than a set of national val-
ues or national character. The logic was twofold. First, the fledgling colonial
regimes had to determine the needs, desires, and interests of the inhabitants. If
authorities hoped to “persuade” the colonized, this necessitated understanding
what exactly what would best persuade them. If authorities aimed to secure
“cooperation,” “confidence,” and “trust,” this demanded ascertaining what the
colonized would cooperate with and what exactly they would trust. Second,
perhaps most critically, authorities had to incorporate what they learned into
their ruling practices. They had to signify their rule as meeting local demands
and incorporate at least some of those demands into their policies and pro-
grams. To achieve a successful occupation without the use of force, colonial
rulers had to construct accommodating states – ruling regimes that would
partially shape themselves to perceived local molds.
In all of the colonies, the Americans’ legitimating efforts followed this logic.
The critical difference had to do with local conditions in the colonies as the
American rulers perceived them, and these therefore dictated what local inter-
ests and demands they incorporated into their ruling forms. This explains the
variation across the U.S. empire.
Let us turn to conditions in Samoa first. Samoa had not been previously ruled
by European colonial powers. Missionaries, traders, and diplomats had been
around, and treaties with European powers had been made, but Samoa had
not been ruled directly by a foreign power in the same manner that Spain had
ruled Guam, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico – that is, with elaborate colonial
administrations. 90 In addition, Samoa was less dependent on the world econ-
omy than other territories. Although vast agricultural lands of Puerto Rico and
the Philippines had been devoted to export production for centuries before U.S.
rule, the copra trade in Samoa was comparably undeveloped and participation
in the wage economy was not necessary for local survival. 91 These features

of Samoa are important. Combined with preexisting Western discourses on
oceanic peoples (such as those provided by the writer Robert Louis Stevenson),
they contributed to a perception among American officials that the islands
and their people were locked in an “undeveloped” state of existence in which
Samoans were comparably content and happy – so much so that American
officials often idealized and romanticized their existence. 92 In his early reports
from Samoa, American consul Henry Ide suggested that the climate and lack of
external influence had left Samoans in a near prelapsarian condition of existence
in which Samoans lived in perfect harmony with their natural surroundings:
“They have abundant fertile land to supply their wants and those of their
posterity for all time.” The Samoans likewise appeared peaceful and docile.
Ide suggested that although intermittent conflicts among the people had previ-
ously erupted, Samoans were very much unlike “our Indian territory filled with
murder and violence.” “Absolute peace has prevailed for nearly three years.”
Ide’s conclusion was that the inhabitants were “picturesque, kindly, polite,
and hospitable.” 93 Others repeated the theme. The Samoans, wrote Governor
Schroeder, “are as a rule good natured and generous. . . . It is doubtless a natu-
ral law that there can be development without hardship, and nature here is so
kind that the natives practically never have to face hardships. They move along
through life, as did many generations of their forefathers, without the necessity
of any great amount of work or of privation.” 94 Therefore, the average Samoan
“is happiest when in his natural state.” 95
In conjunction with the legitimating imperative, these constructions had
important implications for colonial governance. For if the people were already
happy and contented (or seen to be), if their “wants” were relatively few and
simple, colonial rule would fare best to ensure and perpetuate this condition.
This would make for an enduring occupation. Herein, then, lies the origins
of the preservationist governmentality associated with indirect rule. On the
one hand, a preservationist policy was partly a matter of expedience. When
Governor B. F. Tilley in Samoa first tried to secure consent to U.S. sovereignty
from Manua chiefs, he noted that the Tui Manua (ruling chief of Manua)
“did not wish any interference with his ‘kingdom’ by any outside power.”
Tilley further learned that the chiefs “feared that I would take way their lands
and other property.” In response, Tilley declared: “There is no intention to
disturb your quiet, peaceful living, or interfere with your property or affairs.
We do not want your lands or anything that you have unless we buy them
92

My claim is not that preexisting conditions in Samoa alone determined the American officials’
views. They rather converged with already circulating ideas about Pacific islanders. I discuss
the interplay of preexisting historical conditions, racialized meanings, and policy formation in
Samoa and Guam in further detail elsewhere. Go (2004). Steinmetz (2007) offers a nuanced
analysis of the convergence of such ideas with other factors to shape German colonial policy.

with your consent.” After this declaration, the chiefs finally accepted the new
arrangement. 96 Keeping things intact was a way of securing consent.
On the other hand, leaving local conditions intact was also a way of secur-
ing rule in the long term. Tilley’s premise for his preservationist government
was that the people were already “in a most happy and peaceful state. . . . No
changes in the local government of the island will be necessary.” 97 He later
added:
The natives of Tutuila are a gentle, kindly, simple-minded race and are easily gov-
erned. . . . I considered that the best way to govern these people was to let them, as far as
possible, govern themselves, by continuing their good and time-honored customs and
gradually abolishing the bad ones. . . . My aim was to modify this system so as to adapt
it to requirements of civilized government, without at the same time interfering with the
deeply rooted customs of the people or wounding their susceptibilities in any way. 98
Securing consent and maintaining rule meant keeping the natives happy, but as
the natives were perceived to be happy already, successful rule meant maintain-
ing rather than altering their way of life. “Native” ways had to be preserved to
in turn preserve the integrity of rule. “No effort was made to make any radical
changes in the long established customs,” Tilley reported, because “the natives,
naturally docile and easily ruled, are happy and contented.” 99
This explains the preservationist policy in Guam too. Local conditions in
Guam were not entirely different from those in Samoa. Despite the fact that
Guam had been ruled by Spain, it remained relatively unpenetrated by market
forces. Besides a small amount of export agriculture, the island was largely
self-sufficient; islanders lived off land and sea. Politically, colonial rule had
relied on a handful of elite representatives from the landowning class known as
the mana’kilo. This class had not previously made demands for major political
reforms or independence. With only intermittent complaints about taxation,
the island had seen decades of calm. 100 These conditions contributed to Amer-
ican perceptions homologous to those in Samoa – that is, the Chamorros were
perfectly content in their existing state and surroundings, worthy of roman-
ticization. “There was very little crime,” noted one governor as he reflected
on conditions as he found them “ . . . [and] little violation of the law.” 101
The Chamorros were a “peaceful, good-natured, law-abiding people”; the
small class of local intermediaries “have never shown the slightest resistance
or opposition.” 102 Observers likewise saw the Chamorros as untainted by
civilization’s corruptions, free from modernizing desires or pressing needs.

Patterns of Empire
“If wealth consists in the ability to gratify one’s wants,” wrote Governor
William Safford, “the people of Guam may be called rich.” Governor E. J.
Born added: “[T]he islander lives his life in peace and contentment, and is,
apparently, far happier than the average dweller in many a more advanced
country.” 103
As in Samoa, preservationist policies followed. Because the “children” of
Guam were deemed contented, a successful occupation necessitated that they
should best be left to play on their own without rearing them into maturity.
Indeed, authorities rejected public education because “it would be of doubt-
ful advantage to attempt to educate them in subjects likely to induce feelings
of restlessness and dissatisfaction with their simple lives.” 104 Similarly, when
devising the political system, policy makers concluded that a “political educa-
tion” program would not be appropriate – for there was no apparent demand
for it. 105 The implicit theory was that, because the natives did not feel that any-
thing was broken, there was nothing to fix. Any attempts to alter or “develop
their world would do little else than disturb their putatively prelapsarian state,
thereby posing disruptions to the regime’s otherwise smoothly operating sys-
tem. As one early official wrote in his memoirs: “When I first arrived, it seemed
to me that I had discovered Arcadia, and when I received a letter from a friend
asking whether I believed it would be possible to ‘civilize the natives,’ I felt like
exclaiming, ‘God forbid!’” 106
The U.S. tutelage policy in Puerto Rico and the Philippines can be under-
stood by the same logic. On the one hand, as in Guam and Samoa, American
authorities in Puerto Rico and the Philippines insisted that they had to legiti-
mate their rule and recognized that doing so first meant ascertaining local needs
and wants. 107 On the other hand, preexisting conditions in Puerto Rico and
the Philippines were very different from the other territories. Compared with
Guam and Samoa, both Puerto Rico and the Philippines had been more deeply
penetrated by export production for the world market long before Ameri-
can occupation. 108 This made for a distinct history of class formation: the
construction of a powerful and wealthy class of landowners, merchants, and
professionals who enjoyed the market’s monetary fruits. These groups then
used their wealth to cultivate local power and a cosmopolitan outlook. Elite
families sent their sons to schools of higher learning in Manila and San Juan or
to Europe for study and travel. Students returned filled with ideologies of the
Spanish Enlightenment, political tracts from France, and various works of lit-
erature from the European world. In the Philippines, these elites were known as
the “ilustrados” (literally, “enlightened ones”); in Puerto Rico they fashioned

themselves as the “leading class.” Participation in global and local institutions –
from Masonic lodges to scientific associations to political movements – secured
their Westernized intellectual orientation. 109
This background is important for it had contributed to political movements
that framed their demands in modern liberal discourses of self-rule, liberty,
and individual rights. In Puerto Rico, one such movement came in the late
1870s, when wealthy landowning families led a rebellion in the district of
Lares for independence from Spain. The rebellion was soon repressed, but in its
wake came the “autonomist” or autonomı́a movement. This movement, led by
professionals, landowners, intellectuals, and urban middle classes, demanded
that Puerto Rico be incorporated into the Spanish federal system as an equal
self-governing province. It likewise called for expanded educational systems,
freedom of the press and speech, protection of individual rights, “personal lib-
erty and security of the home,” and universal suffrage – among many other
related demands. 110 Parallel movements emerged in the Philippines. Resistance
emerged in the 1880s when ilustrados demanded political reforms from Madrid
and sought equal citizenship with Spaniards. In the 1890s, these demands con-
tinued, but some ilustrados joined a cross-class movement for national indepen-
dence. The movement culminated in the 1896 revolution and the establishment
of the Philippine Republic based in the town of Malolos. The Malolos con-
stitution drew from the Cuban constitution, France’s rights of man, and ideas
of the Spanish Enlightenment. It declared a “free and independent Repub-
lic” whereby “sovereignty resides exclusively in the people”; separation of the
legislative, executive, and judicial branches; the “freedom and equality of all
religions”; and an extended list of individual rights. 111
American authorities were not unaware of these preexisting demands. To be
sure, the Schurman Commission in the Philippines, having announced that its
first task was to discern the “wishes” and “ideals” of the people, devoted much
of its time to learning about them. It held hearings and conducted interviews
in Manila with “eminent Filipinos.” Commissioners also collected information
from their commanders in the field and dug into documents from the Philip-
pine Republic, the revolution, and “pacific organizations of other Filipinos.” 112
Even before this commission’s work, the Hong Kong consulate general had met
with exiled leaders of the Philippine revolution. Likewise, investigative com-
missions in Puerto Rico held hearings with prominent elites, while military
commanders had previously engaged in discussions with Puerto Rico’s “lead-
ing classes.” 113 Thus, as American authorities began devising their colonial
policy, they did what their counterparts did in Guam and Samoa: They tried to

incorporate perceived local demands and desires into their own discourse, poli-
cies, and ruling forms. The difference was that the Puerto Rican and Filipino
elite had articulated very different demands and desires than did Chamorros
and Samoans.
The traces of this process can be discerned in the first public proclamations
issued by American authorities in the Philippines. One of them was McKinley’s
“Proclamation to the Philippine People,” issued in late December 1898. This
was McKinley’s “benevolent assimilation” proclamation, the earliest public
issuance articulating tutelary ideals. Existing scholarship has referred to the
proclamation as evidence for America’s uniquely benign goals, but the refer-
ences elide an important fact: The proclamation came six months after Wash-
ington had already received reports on the Philippines from R. Wildman, the
U.S. consulate general in Hong Kong. Wildman had met with exiled revolu-
tionary leaders. His subsequent report – titled “The Policy and Hopes of the
Insurgent Government of the Philippine Islands” – was telling. It first con-
tended that the Filipinos “cannot be dealt with as though they were North
American Indians.” The Filipinos were far too Westernized; insurgent leaders
like Emilio Aquinaldo or Teodoro Sandiko “are all men who would all be
leaders in their separate departments in any country”; their supporters were
wealthy and educated families who “would hold their own bankers and lawyers
everywhere.” Wildman then noted that the insurgents wanted “annexation to
the United States first, and for independence secondly.” And they were not
driven by primitive instincts, but “are fighting for freedom from the Spanish
rule and rely upon the well known sense of justice that controls all the actions
of our Government as to their future.” 114
Given this background, it is no accident that McKinley’s proclamation por-
trayed Spanish rule as tyrannical and American rule as benign; nor is it acci-
dental that it conjured concepts like freedom and justice: “[W]e come, not as
invaders or conquerors, but as friends . . . the earnest wish and paramount aim
of the military administration [is] to win the confidence, respect, and affection
of the inhabitants of the Philippines by assuring them in every possible way
that full measure of individual rights and liberties which is the heritage of free
peoples, and by proving to them that the mission of the United States is one
of benevolent assimilation, substituting the mild sway of justice and right for
arbitrary rule.” 115 It is as if McKinley’s discourse had been directly shaped by
Wildman’s report. Indeed, previous proclamations – before Wildman’s report –
did not contain tutelary rhetoric. They simply announced American sovereignty
and demanded compliance from the population. 116

For example, the phrase “benevolent assimilation” was reproduced again in a proclamation
by General Otis of January 4, 1899, but earlier proclamations by Otis (August 14, 1898) did
not contain the tutelage rhetoric. It only declared the establishment of military rule [ibid., II,
pp. 429–30, 437–8].Colonial Rules
91
McKinley’s proclamation aimed to incorporate the demands of the colo-
nized into its fold to first establish sovereignty, but the incorporation of local
demands also guided recommendations for colonial policy in the longer run.
The Schurman Commission, whose recommendations on policy were widely
influential, had spent much time trying to ascertain local interests; they met with
prominent Filipinos in Manila and emissaries from the Malolos government
and studied the constitution of the Philippine Republic, speeches of ilustrado
leaders, and a host of other documents – all of which the commissioners deemed
“of the most vital significance” for crafting colonial policy. From their inves-
tigations, the commissioners concluded that the majority of Filipinos wanted
“the tutelage and protection of the United States” rather than independence. 117
Consulting Manila-based ilustrados like Pardo de Tavera (who indeed stated a
desire for American rule), the commissioners argued that the people wanted a
more liberal form of colonial government than Spain had provided. The com-
missioners also concluded that the Filipinos who had rebelled against American
sovereignty wanted the same thing. Referring to documents from the revolu-
tion, they concluded: “What the people want above every other thing, is a
guarantee of those fundamental human rights which Americans hold to be the
natural and inalienable birthright of the individual but which under Spanish
domination in the Philippines were shamefully invaded and ruthlessly trampled
upon.” 118
The commissioner’s recommendations for U.S. colonial government were
guided by these revelations. “If these abuses [from Spanish rule] are reme-
died,” they reported, “if a capable and honest government is instituted, if the
Filipinos are permitted to the full extent of their ability to participate in it . . . if
church is separated from state, if public revenues are used solely to defray
the legitimate expense of government . . . if, in a word, government is adminis-
tered in the Philippines in the spirit in which it is administered in the United
States, the people of that archipelago will, as already a few of them foresee,
enjoy more benefits than they dreamed of when they took up arms against
the corrupt and oppressive domination of Spain.” 119 The commissioners’ final
conclusion was that a liberal tutelage government was necessary. Such a gov-
ernment should give Filipinos a place in the colonial state, attend to public
education, and point to the possibility of self-rule in the future (either in the
form of statehood or national independence). More specifically, the commis-
sioners recommended the very governmental form that colonial rule finally
took – control by American authorities in the central branch but with native
participation, an elective national legislative assembly, and elective local posts.
Such a government would put the colonized on “a course of development
under American training [and] eventually reach the goal of complete local
self-government” as well as eventual “contentment, prosperity, education, and

Patterns of Empire
political enlightenment.” 120 Yet it would also be predicated on local demands
and interests. “It has been a leading motive with the commission in devis-
ing a form of government for the Philippines,” Schurman later reported, “to
frame one which, to the utmost extent possible, shall satisfy the views and
aspirations of the educated Filipinos.” 121 Finally, by the same logic, a tute-
lage government would realize the Americans’ own interests in sustaining a
successful occupation. As the commissioners wrote when registering their rec-
ommendations, “The United States can succeed in governing the Philippines
only by understanding the character and circumstances of the people and real-
izing sympathetically their aspirations and ideals. A government to stand must
be firmly rooted in the needs, interests, judgment and devotion of the people,
and this support is secured by the adaptation of government to the character
and possibilities of the governed – what they are, what they have it in them to
become, what they want, and, not least, what they think they are entitled to
have and enjoy.” 122
The same process unfolded in Puerto Rico. One early investigative commis-
sion was led by Henry Carroll. The Carroll Commission conducted a range of
investigations, including interviews with local leaders, and thereby unearthed
various complaints about Spanish rule. Spanish rule had been too central-
ized, preventing Puerto Ricans from holding high positions; it had impeded
Puerto Rican autonomy for far too long; funds for public education had
been lacking; and the colonial state’s economic policies had benefited Span-
ish bureaucrats and residents alone. The commission further learned about
the autonomy movement that had long been registering these complaints. The
dominant Puerto Rican political parties had demanded full incorporation into
the Spanish regional system, which meant equal rights, an extended suffrage,
and increased levels of participation in the colonial government. 123 Finally, the
commission discovered that the local population welcomed American interven-
tion but hoped that it would eventually lead to statehood in the American Union
(as Puerto Rican leaders’ own speeches from the time stated clearly). 124 Car-
roll’s recommendation for colonial government followed directly from these
discoveries. Carroll suggested that colonial policies should be devoted to build-
ing public schools and regenerating agricultural industries (which had been
suffering as a result of an economic crisis). He further contended that the
colonial government should give the Puerto Rican elite political participation

proposing the specific form of tutelary government, the commissioners in part drew from
models of territorial government, but this does not affirm the exceptionalism argument. In
Guam and Samoa, territorial government at home was not the model, and as seen, the Schur-
man Commission turned to the territorial model only after concluding that the model would
help meet local demands.

and offer the opportunity for eventual statehood. 125 This kind of government
would serve a dual purpose. For one, it would offer an education in self-
government. “They will learn the art of governing the only possible way –
by having its responsibilities laid upon them.” For another, and by the same
token, it would establish and maintain legitimacy by meeting the Puerto Rican
elites’ own desires. “We do not need to promise statehood to them, [but] we
certainly ought not to forbid them to aspire to statehood. It is an honorable
aspiration and would put them on their best behavior.” 126 Other recommen-
dations for colonial government in Puerto Rico were similar. Ultimately, Elihu
Root incorporated all of these suggestions into his own recommendations, and
the Foraker Act passed by Congress in 1900 put the plan into practice. 127
In brief, the formation of America’s colonial regimes resulted from the oppo-
site of what existing exceptionalist thought predicts. U.S. officials in the Philip-
pines and Puerto Rico did not work from their political values to produce
colonial states reflecting those values. Instead, as they strove to cultivate con-
sent and compliance, the process worked the other way around. They made
regimes that ultimately went native, shaping themselves to local conditions
and incorporating what they found there. In this sense, America’s presum-
ably exceptional empire was the product of historical and geographical acci-
dent. Take away the fact that the Puerto Rican and Filipino elite had already
espoused discourses of self-determination, rights, and liberty, and American
occupation there might have looked more like American rule in Samoa and
Guam. The implication regarding exceptionalism is straightforward: Where
seemingly exceptional colonial policies surfaced at all, they had less to do with
America’s unique values, virtues, and traditions than with the specific character
of the colonies themselves.
Britain’s “Native Policy”
The foregoing analysis should serve to unsettle if not upend exceptionalism’s
portrayal of American colonialism. However, an alternative interpretation of
the same events could be marshaled to endorse it. It may be, for instance,
that U.S. policy makers and authorities were uniquely benign in attempting to
meet perceived local conditions and accommodate local demands. What made
the U.S. colonial empire exceptional was that U.S. colonialists cared about
legitimating their rule at all. According to this logic, other colonialists were not

Berbusse (1966), p. 151. General George Davis’s recommendation followed Carroll’s and
was in part borrowed from communications with political leaders like Muñoz Rivera who
in fact suggested a similar type of government to that which U.S. officials finally enacted.
See Davis (1900), p. 75 and L. Muñoz Rivera to E. Root, Aug. 14, 1899 (USNA, RG 350,

military rule could best serve both the Americans’ needs and the Puerto Ricans’. United States

concerned about legitimation and instead followed the principle of “dominance
without hegemony.” 128 Is this the case? Again, a comparative look at the British
empire is warranted.
Although it is impossible here to examine all of Britain’s colonial regimes
and explain their formation, it is appropriate to focus on two colonies: India
and Fiji. After all, as just seen, in devising his paternalistic governmentality in
Samoa, Commander Tilley had declared that British Fiji was his model. We
might rightfully query how that Fijian policy came about in the first place.
Further, in India, British officials constructed liberal colonial policies that pre-
figured America’s tutelary regime in the Philippines. We should wonder about
the origins of those liberal colonial policies too.
First, what accounts for the strategy of paternalistic preservation in Fiji?
Although some elements of the strategy had precedents in the conservative
approach to India (which supported and maintained Indian aristocrats and
their privileges), it would not be a stretch to say that the origins of the policy
lie with Sir Arthur Gordon. The youngest son of the fourth Earl of Aberdeen,
Gordon had served in Trinidad, New Brunswick, and Mauritius before his
appointment to Fiji. Gordon largely invented indirect rule for Fiji. So what
guided his approach? At least two considerations were important to Gordon.
The first had to do with state coffers. The home government was determined
to make Fiji economically self-sufficient so that it would not become a finan-
cial burden. Gordon subsequently worried about the dearth of funds for his
administration. 129 Second was the relationship between Fijians and foreigners.
By the time Gordon came, Fiji had already seen its share of missionaries, set-
tlers, merchants, and cotton planters. This had not made for a happy situation.
British planters were scheming to obtain Fijians’ land and deploy Fijian labor
to meet global demand for cotton (which had been increasing since the Civil
War in the United States). In turn, Fijians were cautious if not fearful alto-
gether of British residents and government agents. After a measles epidemic
killed 40,000 of the estimated 150,000 Fijians, rumors circulated that British
diplomats had deliberately introduced the disease to kill them off. 130 Suspicion
filled the air.
Both of these issues shaped Gordon’s preservationist approach. The lack of
funds might have been enough to compel Gordon to adopt it. If Gordon could
not hire a sufficient number of British officials to administer the islands, using
indigenous political structures would have been a good alternative. However,
the tension between Fijians and foreigners was also an important factor. For
Gordon, this was a major issue indeed. To him, it spoke to more fundamental
ones, not least how to deal with “native” populations in general. The problem,
according to Gordon, came down to the fact that the “white settlers in Fiji
had not colonized an empty waste[land] . . . only roamed over by nomadic
savages.” They were instead “scattered here and there among a large and

industrious settled population,” outnumbered “by more than fifty to one.” 131
In this situation, the problem of how to rule native populations was pressing.
Unlike settler colonies in North America – where whites outnumbered natives
and where there were at most “nomadic savages” to fret about – the large
number of natives posed a potential threat, and colonial control carried the
possibility for arousing resistance. A distinct governmentality was required. As
Gordon put it, conditions in Fiji raised the “question – one which has seldom
been answered in any satisfactory manner – how a large native population
should be governed by a handful of white aliens?” 132
One option was to succumb to the settlers’ and planters’ demands and
expropriate Fijian land and labor. In Gordon’s view, however, this was impos-
sible. Turning Fijians into instruments of British capital was not only morally
objectionable, but also damaging to British legitimacy. 133 The natives had to
be protected from settler abuses in order to ensure “the credit of England,”
as Gordon put it. 134 Such protection would also help sustain British rule in
the long run. Here we see the similarity with policy formation in the American
empire: Gordon was concerned about legitimacy and winning compliance from
the colonized. As he explained to Gladstone, protecting “the native race from
oppression and fraud” would create “a better feeling” between the British and
the natives. Cultivating this “better feeling” would be essential for British rule;
there would be “no longer any fear of anarchy or disorder.” 135
Many of Gordon’s policies followed from this protectionist imperative, such
as laws limiting the amount of land that passed to Europeans, for instance,
or importing laborers from India so that Fijian laborers would not have to
be enlisted. 136 If maintaining British rule was the goal, however, why not
other measures rather than paternalistic protection and preservation? Gordon’s
regime could have protected the natives from settler exploitation and thereby
prevent disorder while also “civilizing” and transforming them. Why not pre-
vent settler abuses of natives while also developing the natives into British-like
subjects? Why not an electoral political system with local governments and
large legislatures like those at home or those being developed in British India,
which aimed to teach the natives British-style self-government? 137 Yet Gordon
rejected this approach with the same determination that he rejected the settlers’

Ibid. Gordon may have overstated the novelty of the problem. British rule in North America
and in the Caribbean had also encountered its brand of “the native question,” and Gordon
had already served in Trinidad and Mauritius. Herman Merivale, who served in India, had
prefaced the problem as early as 1839, contending that the native question posed the “greatest
moral difficulty of colonization” [Merivale quoted in McNab (1977), p. 361]. Still, this does
not negate that Gordon himself faced the problem of governance in Fiji.

approach. The reason had to with Gordon’s perceptions of the Fijians’ charac-
ter and lifestyle. Like his American counterparts in Samoa and Guam, Gordon
romanticized and idealized Fijians. Gordon repeatedly insisted to his friends at
home that Fijians were “a good deal away from barbarism” and in fact were
“civilized”; they had a “civilization of their own.” 138 “I think the civilization
of the natives,” he wrote to Gladstone, “would excite surprise at home.” 139
Gordon was especially taken by their “respect for agricultural labor” and the
“high position of women” in Fijian society. 140 He likewise romanticized the
natural environment of Fiji, which, combined with the presumed communal
land system and the industriousness of the people, produced a near paradise
wherein any single village “may be so rich and prosperous” as to provide all
the necessities of life. 141 Gordon thus disdained comparisons that settlers made
between Fijians and the Australian “savage.” To Gordon, Fijians are “as supe-
rior to the savages of Australia as we are to Fijians – perhaps more so.” They
were “peaceable, orderly, educated and [in] their own fashion civilized.” 142
As Gordon saw idyllic Pacific islanders just like his American counterparts
in Samoa and Guam, so too did he oppose transformative policies. He did not
want to transform the natives because he saw little need to improve them. Given
the presumably simple and idyllic existence of the natives’ lives, attempts to
“civilize” or radically transform Fijians would only stir trouble. Putting “pres-
sure . . . upon the native to adopt European habits” would leave “the natives,
bewildered and depressed, deprived of all interest and object in life, [and they
would] sink into indolence, apathy, and vice and, exposed almost without any
safeguard to snares and temptations innumerable, they lose position, property,
self-respect and health.” Rather than try to transform the natives, it was better
to preserve their ways and deploy them. “It is manifest that the more the native
policy is retained, native agency employed, and changes avoided until naturally
and spontaneously called for the less likely are these results to follow.” 143
Gordon’s policy of preserving and using native institutions was thus born.
Based on a romantic construction of Fijian life, it was a strategic necessity
aimed at keeping natives happy and thereby ensuring an enduring British rule.
Or as Gordon himself put it, “policy and necessity pointed in the same direction
as right and justice.” 144 Rather than oppress or civilize, colonial rule should
preserve and protect, if only in order to better maintain itself. Gordon was
unequivocal here. Given that “whites” were “outnumbered” by Fijians, and
given the fact that the Fijians already had a “complex social and political
organization in vigorous activity,” “it is not safe, even if it be practicable,

to deny to the natives a large measure of self-government” – that is, self-
government according to perceived political “custom.” 145
In short, the logic of legitimation worked in Fiji to produce a preservation-
ist colonial governmentality. What, then, about India? There, too, the logic
of legitimation operated, but because India exhibited very different conditions
than Fiji, the policy also differed. On the one hand, officials in India were con-
cerned with the legitimacy just like their counterparts in Fiji or the Philippines,
Puerto Rico, Samoa, and Guam. In part, financial considerations made this
concern all the more pressing. The Crown had inherited a financially unstable
regime from the East India Company, and during the latter decades of the nine-
teenth century it was almost continually at war defending India’s borders from
rival empires. 146 To pay for defense, British officials in India had to levy income
taxes and extract resources from localities. Doing so demanded cooperation
from local Indian elites and leaders. British officials had to win them over. 147
The so-called Indian Mutiny of 1857–1859 further pushed the legitimacy issue
to the fore. In the shadow of this tumultuous event, the Crown faced the nag-
ging threat of more rebellion. This was a context of concern and worry for
British rulers not unlike that faced by American rulers in the Philippines dur-
ing and after the Philippine rebellion against them. Coupled with the colonial
regime’s financial concerns, it meant that successive British rulers had to pay
attention to local demands and wants, not least those of the elite, to maintain
British rule. In the wake of the revolt, Charles Wood warned the House of
Commons in 1859 that the British state needed to open up to Indian demands
rather than repress them. “We have seen the consequences, and if we hope to
retain India in peace and tranquility we must take care so to govern it not only
to consult the interests, but the feelings of the Native population.” 148
On the other hand, although the imperative of legitimacy was prevalent in
India just like everywhere else, what led to the liberal colonial policies there
as opposed to Fiji was the conjunction of this imperative with particular local
developments. India exhibited very different conditions than Fiji. India was
not a seemingly idyllic island in the remote Pacific visited by scattered sailors,
settlers, and missionaries. It was a series of expansive provinces that had been
under East India Company rule for at least a century. Rather than putatively
pristine natives living in remote villages, British rulers faced a politically active
elite often educated in Western political ideas and ideals. Since 1835, when
Lord Macaulay initiated important educational reforms, elite education had
spread exponentially (Sir Charles Wood’s grants-in-aid system beginning in
1854 spread education even more). From 1864 to 1885, a total of 48,251 Indian
students entered university across the provinces. 149 Concentrated mostly in

urban centers like Calcutta, Bombay, and Poona, these were “men of high status
but frequently of low income”; many belonged to landowning families but
were not necessarily aristocratic themselves. 150 Typically they entered public
service or the professions. They also led new politically oriented associations
that became a critical component of India’s political life and eventually shaped
colonial policy. 151
Who were these associations and what did they want? The first important
associations were formed in Bengal, Bombay, and Madras: the British Indian
Association (founded in Calcutta in 1851), the Bombay Association (founded
1852), and the Landholders’ Society (which came out of the Zemindars’ Associ-
ation, as it was first called in 1837). 152 Other groups subsequently emerged. The
British Indian Association represented long-standing landed interests. Suren-
dranath Banerjea’s new Indian Association became a venue for the latest
generation of educated middle classes (one of the founding members had a
degree from Cambridge). The demands of these groups constituted a “moder-
ate nationalism.” As historian Sanjay Seth notes, this was “moderate” in the
sense that few if any of the leaders actually demanded independence. They
wanted more participation and representation. Leaders such as Banerjea stated
that they “prided themselves on, and reiterated at every opportunity, the grad-
ualist and constitutionalist nature of their political activity.” 153 Yet despite this
gradualism, their demands were consistent and framed in terms of liberal the-
ory and the language of British politics. The British Indian Association initially
demanded the appointment of at least one native member to the Legislative
Council, arguing that “the natives of India . . . are deeply sensible of the value
of political freedom.” 154 In 1856, the Association argued for a “deliberative
body which shall possess all the requisites of a constitutional legislature.” 155 In
1860, it argued for the need to find an institutional place for “the voice of the
people . . . their views, their wishes and their wants.” 156 The Association also
campaigned against the Calcutta municipal bill of 1854 and the salt monopoly
in 1855; it pushed for court reform, petitioned for a Commission of Inquiry
into the Indigo riots, and proposed a governor-in-council for Bengal. 157 As
other groups joined these and other efforts, and as their numbers proliferated,
so too did the demands. Many began petitioning not just for native participa-
tion in office, but also for elections. 158 At its first session in 1885, the Indian
National Congress called for an expansion of the elective principle and advisory

councils. It later demanded that at least half of the members of the Imperial
and Provincial Legislative Councils be elected. 159
The emergence and proliferation of these groups was important. It meant
that British officials faced a flurry of political activity and mobilization from
educated professionals, urban elites, and powerful rural landowners who spoke
their language, deployed their political concepts, and demanded the sorts of
privileges and political institutions that rich Englishmen were afforded. “One
hears a great deal at home about the immobility of the East,” Lord Ripon
wrote to Gladstone in 1881, “but I have, on the contrary, been much struck
by the changes which are evidently being effected in India by . . . the spread
of English legal ideas and methods, and by the increasing knowledge on the
part of the people of their legal rights.” 160 Equally imposing was the fact that,
beginning in the 1870s, Indian political leaders took inspiration from the Home
Rule movement in Ireland and found allies in Parliament. 161 Lord Dufferin was
especially worried about this. “[E]vents at home in regard to Ireland,” he noted,
“[have] produced a very considerable effect upon the minds of the intelligent
and educated sections of our own native community.” 162
The post-Mutiny context, the states’ fiscal considerations, and the rising
educated classes and their “modern democratic agitation” eventually gave colo-
nial governmentality in India its tutelary and transformative tone, making the
regime in India look very different from Fiji and more like the Philippines. In
fact, liberal concessions had begun almost immediately after the Mutiny, with
the replacement of Company rule by Crown rule. Charles Canning, governor
general of India (1856–1862), admitted natives onto the new Legislative Coun-
cil in an effort to win over the princely classes. As one official explained, by
this policy the natives “will no longer feel, as they have hitherto done, that they
are excluded from the management of affairs in their own country.” 163
Whereas these early efforts at reconciliation by the Crown involved cultivat-
ing key elements of the aristocracy, the proliferation of middle-class political
associations meant that successive British officials would have to call on them
to collaborate too. 164 Lord Ripon was one of the officials who recognized their

Quoted in Metcalf (1964), p. 267. Canning’s policy followed the principles laid down in
Sayyid Ahmad’s famous essay on the causes of the rebellion (translated and published by
the government). Ahmad had written that one of the causes of the revolt was widespread
dissatisfaction among Indians about participation in government; he thus concluded that
letting Indians into the Legislative Council would help ward off future trouble. Had there been
Indians already on the council, he surmised, there would have been no uprising. See ibid.,
p. 90.
The Queen’s 1876 assumption of the title “Empress of India” was part of an attempt to win
the “sympathy and cordial allegiance” of that aristocracy, the winning of which would be “no
inconsiderable guarantee for the stability of the Indian Empire,” as Lord Lytton declared. See
Moore (1999), p. 431.100

importance and the need to incorporate their Western-style demands. Touring
the Punjab and Sindh in 1880, he noticed the demands in the Indian press for
more self-government and later wrote to Gladstone: “[T]he problem is how
to deal with this newborn spirit of progress . . . so as to direct it into a right
course.” 165 He further wrote: “[T]here are few Indian questions of greater
importance in the present day than those which relate to the mode in which we
are to deal with the growing body of Natives educated by ourselves in Western
learning and Western ideas.” 166 “Thirty years of education upon a European
basis” in India, he insisted, “ . . . must henceforth be recognized in our Indian
policy.” 167
Ripon was determined to win over these “highly educated natives.” Accord-
ingly, as he explained to Lord Kimberley (undersecretary for India), he decided
to “take steps to supply the legitimate outlets for those aspirations and to satisfy
those ambitions consistent with the maintenance of authority.” 168 His policies
on local self-government and elections followed. The day after his Resolution
on Local Self-Government, he explained to his friend W. E. Forster that his
policies were driven by the “hourly increasing . . . necessity of making the edu-
cated natives the friends, instead of the enemies, of our rule.” 169 In explaining
his policies to Gladstone, he said that the developments in education and the
spread of English political discourses among the Indian elite
lead me to attach much importance to measures which . . . are calculated to provide a
legitimate outlet for the ambitions and aspirations which we have ourselves created
by the education, civilization and material progress, which we have been the means of
introducing into the country; such measures will not only have an immediate effect in
promoting gradually and safely the political education of the people, which I hold to be
a great object of public policy, but will also pave the way for further advances in the
same direction as that education becomes fuller and more widespread. 170
Before his departure from India, Ripon left a note to his successor, Lord
Dufferin, explaining that the “most pressing problem before the Government
was to provide a field for the legitimate aspirations and ambitions of English
educated Indians, and thus to make them friends and supporters of the British
Raj. They constituted a growing force and unless they were conciliated and
befriended the Government would find soon to its dismay landed in a diffi-
cult and intricate situation.” 171 Dufferin was not an avowed liberal, but he
apparently took notice. Initially, Dufferin was less interested in the educated
activists and more about princely support for military operations against Rus-
sia’s advances in Central Asia. However, as the educated classes made their

demands clearer and louder, he soon reconsidered his strategy. He was espe-
cially worried about the fact that “associations and sub-associations are being
formed all over the country.” “Day after day,” he said, “hundreds of sharp-
witted Babus pour forth their indignation against their English oppressors in
very pungent and effective diatribes.” 172 He thus wondered to Kimberley: “I
cannot help asking myself how long an autocratic Government like that of
India . . . will be able to stand the strain implied by the importation en bloc
from England, or rather from Ireland, of the perfected machinery of modern
democratic agitation.” 173
It is for this reason that Dufferin responded to local conditions in India
in ways that Ripon probably recognized clearly. Whereas Dufferin’s taxation
policies conceded to the economic interests of the entrenched landed aristoc-
racy, many of his governmental policies paid heed to the wishes of the ris-
ing middle classes and educated elites. 174 In December of 1886, the Indian
National Congress demanded that at least half of the provincial councils be
elected. Early the next year, Dufferin adopted the same proposal as his own. He
explained that his goal was to prevent a “Home Rule organization established
in India, on Irish lines, and under the patronage of Irish and Radical Members
of Parliament.” 175 His reasoning was that a “concession now would stop a
good deal of agitation. . . . By extending this small and restricted political priv-
ilege to responsible Bodies constituted by law we should . . . take the wind out
of the sails of the Associations.” 176 For Dufferin, these policies were politically
expedient. “Amongst the natives,” he explained to Lord Kimberley in 1886,
there are a considerable number who are both able and sensible, and upon whose loyal
cooperation one could undoubtedly rely. The fact of their supporting the government
would popularize many of its acts . . . and if they in their turn had a native party behind
them, the government of India would cease to stand up, as it does now, an isolated rock
in the middle of a tempestuous sea, around whose base the breakers dash themselves
simultaneously from all the four quarters of the heavens. Now that we have educated
these people, their desire to take a larger part in the management of their own domestic
affairs seems to me a legitimate and reasonable aspiration, and I think there should be
enough statesmanship amongst us to contrive the means of permitting them to do so
without unduly comprising our Imperial supremacy. 177
The fact that Dufferin’s policies continued the liberal approach of his prede-
cessors, despite his Whig leanings, attests to the larger point. Within India,
British officials’ personalities or political affiliations did not determine British
policy. As they all faced similar local conditions, and as they were subject to the
logic of legitimation, they produced similar policies. We can now see that this

principle applies across empires as well as within them. In the U.S. and British
empire alike, colonial rulers had to worry about the appearance and legitimacy
of their rule. What differed were the sociopolitical conditions that gave cer-
tain types of concessions more valence than others. As a result of varied local
conditions and contingencies, officials in Samoa and Fiji perceived different
wants and interests in local groups than those perceived by officials in India,
the Philippines, or Puerto Rico. Subsequent policies and practices varied across
these sites accordingly. In short, colonial policies were not shaped by national
character, values, or styles but by the very spaces and scenes they aimed to
manipulate and manage. To this, America’s colonial empire was no exception.3
Hegemonies and Empires
Other nations in history have fought in foreign lands and remained to occupy and
exploit. Americans, following a battle, want nothing more than to return home.
– George W. Bush, Speech on the USS Abraham Lincoln (2003)
In 1940, Adolph Berle, the undersecretary in the U.S. Department State, penned
a prescient passage in his diary. “I have been saying to myself and other people,
that the only possible effect of this war would be that the United States would
emerge with an imperial power greater than the world had ever seen.” 1 It is
unclear what Berle meant exactly by “imperial power.” Most likely, he meant
it as the founders of the American Revolution had meant it – that is, sovereign
strength or greatness. If so, Berle’s statement was on the spot. The United States
did emerge from World War II as the world’s leading economic and military
power. In 1950, its GDP was higher than all of Europe’s put together and near
equal to Europe’s and Russia’s combined. The United States was the world’s
leading exporter and foreign investor. Its financial and industrial strength was
matched by its agricultural exports. The United States was “the workshop,
bakery, and banker of the world.” 2
On the other hand, Berle’s characterization of America’s postwar power as
“greater than the world had ever seen” was arguably overstated. Portraying
the United States as fundamentally different from other countries, it implied
that America’s standing had no modern parallel or precursor. Yet, the United
States was not the world’s first great power to emerge from a world war. A
century earlier, the world had also seen a great war – the Napoleonic Wars –
and Britain had emerged from the ashes of that war as the leading hegemon. As
Metternich’s advisor, Friedrich von Gentz, wrote after the Vienna Congress,
“Britain appeared in Vienna [with] a solid basis of prosperity and power such as
1

Patterns of Empire
no other country has acquired in our days.” 3 For the next sixty years at least,
Britain dominated the globe economically and militarily, just as the United
States did from 1945 to the 1970s. “The United States,” noted the British
foreign secretary soon after World War II, “is in the position today that Britain
was at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.” 4
Berle’s characterization overlooks another similarity between the United
States and Great Britain. Not only did both reach hegemonic maturity during
their respective centuries, their paths to power had been paved by imperialism.
As seen in previous chapters, Britain’s pre-hegemonic career had involved settler
colonialism in the Western hemisphere and then further expansion into India,
the African coast, and parts of Asia. Similarly, by World War II, the United
States had conquered the North American continent and then reached overseas
to seize colonies in the Pacific and the Caribbean. In light of these similarities,
new questions arise. Both the United States and Great Britain rose to global
economic power during their respective centuries of ascendance, and both had
constructed empires along the way. Yet questions remain: What happened
during their respective periods of hegemonic maturity? As they stood at the
pinnacle of economic global power, did they act imperiously as they had acted
during their ascent?
The concept “hegemony,” recall, refers to a relational economic position
in the world system. It is therefore distinguishable from empire, which is a
political relation. A state can be imperial without being a hegemon. And a state
can enjoy a preponderance over the world economy – that is, be hegemonic –
without being imperial. Our task in this chapter is as follows: We will exam-
ine whether hegemonic status corresponded to any imperialistic practices and
how the two hegemons’ practices compare. Addressing this issue will enable
us to better pinpoint what, if anything at all, differed between America’s exer-
cises of global power in the mid-twentieth century and Britain’s exercises in
the mid-nineteenth. At stake in the comparison is another goal: to confront
exceptionalism. We have seen how exceptionalist thought has been deployed
to make sense of America’s activities prior to World War II, when the United
States ascended to global power. But what about exceptionalism vis-à-vis Amer-
ica’s post–World War II activities? Might it be here that exceptionalism tells
us something useful?
Let us begin by returning to the Philippines.
Exceptionalism Returns
On July 4, 1946, while Americans celebrated their independence from Britain,
another celebration of national independence was occurring halfway around
the world. In the Philippines, a crowd of some 400,000 gathered in Manila

to watch the lowering of the American flag, thereby ending a half century of
American colonialism. Presumably, the event was an expression of America’s
liberal essence. “Our Nation covets no territory,” declared President Roosevelt
in his message to Congress on Philippine Independence; “it desires to hold no
people against their will.” Senator Millard Tydings of Maryland colored the
event monumental, calling it “one of the most unprecedented, most idealis-
tic, and most far-reaching events in all recorded history.” General Douglas
MacArthur, who gave a speech at the ceremonies, claimed that it marked noth-
ing less than an entirely new world order. MacArthur’s own father, Arthur
MacArthur, Jr., had led American forces in “pacifying” the islands at the turn
of the century and briefly served as military governor in Manila. More than
four decades later, his son Douglas declared: “Let history record this event as
foretelling the end of mastery over peoples by force alone – the end of empire as
the political chain which binds the unwilling weak to the unyielding strong.” 5
When the ceremony ended, MacArthur exclaimed to Carlos Romulo, his for-
mer staff member and prominent member of the Philippine oligarchy, “Carlos,
America buried imperialism here today!” 6
This rhetoric about Philippine independence encapsulates the ways in which
exceptionalist thought has portrayed America’s post–World War II activities. In
exceptionalism’s conception, the United States has been a benign world power,
intrinsically anticolonial, inaugurating a world free from imperialism. There
are a number of elements to this picture. One has to do with America’s colo-
nial empire. As noted, that empire was not unlike European empires, but the
exceptionalist narrative readily domesticates it into its very architecture. In the
exceptionalist story, even if the United States briefly had an empire, it quickly
gave it away and refrained from acquiring any new colonies. “The year 1945
brought the final American rejection of empire,” asserts David Fieldhouse. 7
Supposedly, this distinguishes the United States from other empires. “Atheni-
ans, Romans, Ottomans, and the British wanted land, colonies, treasure, and
grabbed all they could get when they could,” notes one historian, but the United
States “hasn’t annexed anyone’s soil since the Spanish-American War.” 8 To
Eric Hobsbawm, this means that “the differences between . . . US ambitions and
those of Britain of a century and more ago are stark.” 9
Besides pointing to America’s reluctance to colonize, traditional exceptional-
ism insists that the United States supported national self-determination around

Patterns of Empire
the globe. The American state pushed for the decolonization of the European
empires and helped construct a world order consisting of nation-states rather
than empires. When it did employ its military to occupy other countries or
engage in war, it was never intent on long-term colonization, leaving behind
independent states rather than colonies. 10 The exceptionalist story also sees
America’s overseas interventions as benign attempts to promote democracy.
Presumably, whereas European colonial empires repressed independence, mar-
kets, private property, and political rights, the United States has long adopted
a distinct “mission” of “exporting democracy.” 11 It has promoted American
civilization and spread the light of liberty. On these grounds some historians
reject any comparison between the United States and European empires. “No
other military force has displayed the same consistent commitment to creating
functioning, if limited, democracies in societies under occupation. No other
military force has taken control of distant territories with the same consistent
commitment to an early departure.” 12
A related part of the story is that the United States took on the comparably
unique task of opening the world to free commerce for the benefit of all. This
was concomitant with its opposition to colonialism. In the ideal version of
the free market according to Adam Smith, free markets are antithetical to
colonialism and its mercantilist protections. Whereas empires seek colonies to
obtain privileged access to raw materials and exclusive markets, anticolonialism
means the support of free market ideals. 13 Historian Thomas Bender notes of
this view:
Americans are always anxious to deny the relevance of empire to their history. They tend
to rely on a contrast with Europe to justify this way of understanding their past. They
point out that except for an aberration that resulted in the taking possession of Puerto
Rico, Guam, the Philippines, and, indirectly, Cuba, Americans did not colonize or rule
territories as European powers did. Instead, they used their economic, military, and
diplomatic leverage to create a world of free trade available to all. America’s activity
in the world, according to this account, was primarily that of private actors in the
marketplace, not government rule over distant peoples and territories. 14
Bender adds that the “American way of empire [after World War II] was even
presented as anti-imperialism because it guaranteed openness, in contrast to
the exclusivity of the old empires.” 15
Exceptionalism returns. The claim is that, although the United States may
have been imperialistic during its ascent to global hegemony, it has acted

Bruce Cumings asserts that empire refers to “some form of direct or monopoly control of
another nation or of regions of the world economy (such as sterling blocs and frank blocs),”
but inasmuch as the United States does not possess “monopoly controls in the world economy,”
it cannot be classified as an empire [Cumings (2003)].

fundamentally differently from other powers during its period of hegemonic
maturity. It decolonized its empire, refused to take new colonies, pushed for
free markets, and supported self-determination around the world.
Traditional exceptionalism, though, has not been the only approach. The
revisionist school animated by W. A. Williams and the Wisconsin School offers
a different one. The revisionist story does not dispute that the United States
was reluctant to annex new territory or that it pursued free trade. It stresses,
however, that the lack of colonies does not mean a lack of empire. “One need
not send out ships, seize territories, and hoist flags to construct an empire,”
notes John Lewis Gaddis. Empire is a matter of influence and control, and
these may occur with or without the crude hand of direct colonialism. It
can happen “informally” or indirectly. Magdoff initially called this “impe-
rialism without colonies.” 16 More recently, others have relabeled it “empire
by remote control” or “nonterritorial imperialism.” 17 Revisionist narratives
thus tell tales of an American empire based on “commerce and finance” or
other subtle mechanisms of power rather than territorial control. 18 Through
military interventions, temporary occupations, covert operations, “alliances,
bases, investments, and bribes,” the United States has cultivated a network of
client states nominally independent but nonetheless subject to American power
and influence. 19 This is a new type of empire transcending the territorialism of
old-world imperialism. As opposed to traditional exceptionalist thought, revi-
sionism insists that the American state was “imperial,” but defines imperialism
as involving more or something other than just colonization.
The difference between traditional exceptionalism and revisionism partly
turns on definition. Does “empire” only mean formal colonialism? Or should
it not accommodate other types of power? But, beyond this difference, both
approaches share important ground. Both suggest that America after World
War II was nonterritorialist in the sense that it did not seek new colonies. Both
also see something novel in America’s activities. Brushing away America’s ear-
lier colonial expansion as an “aberration,” both approaches see America’s
global activities in the mid-twentieth century as special (either because they
involved constructing an empire or because they involved constructing a new
type of empire). Indeed, some revisionists assert that informal empire is exactly
what differentiates the United States from Britain. Rather than colonizing, “the
US operated instead with dependent and satellite states.” 20 Others add that the
very refusal of exceptionalists and the American public to call the United States
an empire manifests America’s distinctiveness. Attempts to deny empire are
but predictable manifestations of a “denial and displacement” of America’s

Patterns of Empire
indisputable imperial history. 21 Denying empire is simply what makes the U.S.
empire unique. As the diametric opposite of exceptionalism, therefore, revi-
sionism carries some of the assumptions of its predecessor. By insisting on
imperial uniqueness, it inscribes exceptionalist logic at the point of its possible
dissolution.
There is another similarity between traditional exceptionalism and revision-
ism: Both approaches depend on comparison even though they do not actually
conduct the comparison themselves. It is one thing to say that United States
was reluctant to take new territory, that it supported the independence of
other states, or that it pursued global free trade. It is another thing altogether
to say that this makes the United States different from other powers or renders
the United States exceptional. Similarly, it is one thing to say that the United
States disavowed colonialism to exercise informal imperialism; it is another to
depict this as something unique, unprecedented, unusual, or novel. In order to
validate the latter part of these claims and thereby assert American exception-
alism, we would have to make visible and interrogate the rule against which
America’s presumably unique reluctance and nonterritorial tactics are mea-
sured. The premise of exceptionalist thinking is that there is such a rule. The
notion is that other empires were not so reluctant, were always eager and
determined to seize new territory, and aggressively sought “land, colonies, and
treasure,” whereas the United States creatively employed more subtle means.
The related depiction is that other powers preferred colonial empire over mech-
anisms of money, trade, alliances, and clientelism, and that they were never
hesitant to proudly label themselves “empires.” The question that then arises is
whether this has in fact been the rule of other empires. If not, perhaps the pre-
sumed American way of empire has not been so distinctly American. At stake in
reconsidering existing approaches to America’s postwar empire is not just how
we define empire: It is how America’s postwar activities fare comparatively.
In particular, at least two issues regarding the British empire merit attention.
First, both traditional exceptionalism and revisionism portray non-American
empires as consistently and unqualifiedly expansionist in the territorial mode
while never failing to proudly label themselves an empire. But is this how the
British state behaved? Second, exceptionalism and revisionism tend to measure
America’s activities against British colonial expansion, thereby reducing British
power to territorial rule. Yet is formal empire the only “rule” of the British
empire against which we can measure America’s informal imperialism?
Reluctance, “Free Trade,” and Denial
In April of 1868, British troops led by Charles Napier took control of Magdala,
the seat of power in Abyssinia. The British had come to Magdala to rescue
Europeans and the British consul who had been captured, imprisoned, and
reportedly tortured by King Theodore of Abyssinia. The king, a.k.a. “Emperor
21
Kaplan and Pease (1993).Hegemonies and Empires
109
Theodore, King of Ethiopia, King of Kings and the Chosen of God,” was
a notorious tyrant. He had previously constructed his own mini-empire by
attacking neighboring Moslem provinces. 22 The military campaign aimed to
stop this perceived menace and also free European captives. With 13,000 British
and Indian combat troops, 291 naval vessels, and the latest military technology,
it was highly successful. The 265 prisoners were freed, King Theodore killed
himself at the threat of capture, and only two British officers lost their lives in
the entire expedition. On April 13, the British flag was raised. Charles Napier –
and Britain – emerged as the undisputed victor.
Important for our purposes is not the campaign itself but what happened
afterward – or more precisely, what did not happen. The capture of Mag-
dala, with Napier as the lone victor, gave Britain a unique opportunity to take
Abyssinia as a colony and thereby add to its empire. To be sure, Britain had had
interests in the region that would have made it an attractive acquisition. British
merchants had been trading in the area for decades; Abyssinia and Britain had
entered a treaty allowing those merchants to continue; and reports boasted of
the region’s fertile soil, gold, and ivory. However, disorder in the outlying areas
had thwarted trade. British colonial rule would have helped establish order and
security. Furthermore, British officials had long feared French ambitions in the
region; Abyssinia was seen as a possible route to India. 23 Fittingly, some British
consuls had been urging the Foreign Office to consider turning Abyssinia into a
British domain. “Were an English governor [here] . . . ,” wrote Consul Plowden
urging annexation, “how soon would the impulse of British energy, industry,
and commercial enterprise be felt throughout this noble plateau extending
nearly to the Equator, comprising some of the finest countries in Africa, and
some of its most docile and intelligent races!” 24 Yet Britain did not seize the
opportunity. Napier, although the undisputed ruler of Magdala, a result of his
overwhelming military victory, instead lowered the flag. Rather than leaving
behind British troops, colonial governors, or administrators, he left the con-
quered King Theodore’s former subjects in the hands of a northern prince who
had aided the British. On June 18, a few months after first seizing Magdala,
the very last British troops left African soil. The next day, Her Majesty’s ships
sailed for home. There had been no attempt to retain British control. Nor had
London sent orders to establish a permanent British presence. The British won
but then ran. 25
The decision to exit rather than maintain a colonial presence is sugges-
tive. First, it suggests a shift from the previous century. Whereas Britain had
expanded its territorial holdings in the century prior to the Napoleonic Wars,

it now – during its period of hegemony – appeared more reluctant to take new
territories. Second, the withdrawal offers a comparative caution. As noted,
both conventional exceptionalism and its revisionist counterpoint depend on
an implicit comparison. Presumably, whereas the United States disavowed for-
mal empire, other powers, like the British in the nineteenth century, were
unqualifiedly aggressive in the territorial mode. Yet the decision in 1868 to just
leave suggests that the British state was not as imperialistic in the territorial
mode as exceptionalist thought portrays. As T. O. Lloyd notes, the refusal to
annex after the Abyssinian expedition shows that “if expansion in Africa was
now possible, British politicians were not interested.” 26 This may be overstated
considering Britain’s other activities in Africa (to which we will later turn). Yet
it does raise the question: Might it be that Britain, as it achieved hegemonic
maturity, turned away from territorial aggrandizement just as the United States
ostensibly did in the mid-twentieth century?
Cautious Colonialism
The refusal to take Abyssinia was not an isolated incidence of indifference.
In fact, the British rejected various other opportunities to expand its territo-
rial empire. At the peace of Amiens, the British handed back twenty of their
conquests. 27 In 1806 and 1807, amid the Napoleonic wars, British forces occu-
pied Montevideo and Buenos Aires, but they did not stay for long. Rather than
seizing them as colonies, the British swiftly exited. 28 During the Opium War of
1849–1852, British troops numbering 50,000 subdued Nanking and surround-
ing areas, but London gave no orders to establish territorial rule. Later, in 1860,
British and French forces took Peking and burned the emperor’s palace, but
those forces too swiftly exited. 29 A year later, British troops similarly occupied
Vera Cruz in Mexico. The instructions from London were unequivocal: British
troops were not to be used to colonize but only to help settle outstanding British
claims and protect British residents. 30 In 1857, Napoleon III made overtures
to Lord Palmerston that northern Africa should be divided between them as
territorial spoils. This would have given Britain precious Egypt. But Palmerston
was not interested. “We do not want Egypt,” he declared. “[L]et us abstain
from a crusade of conquest.” 31
This is not to say that Britain disavowed territorial expansion altogether
from 1816 to the 1860s. As many scholars have stressed, the British state
did add to its colonial empire. 32 Still, there are important qualifications. First,
although the British state expanded its holdings during its period of hegemony,

it acquired much less during this period than before. From 1763 (after defeating
France in the Seven Years’ War) to 1815, Britain had acquired thirty-nine new
colonies, but from 1816 to 1873 it only acquired twenty-three. 33 Second, many
of the new annexations were not really “new,” nor did they necessarily imply
unqualified territorial aggression. Some reflected an administrative reorganiza-
tion of existing territories (the Gold Coast, the Straits Settlements, and Turks
and Caicos). Others reflected commitments made much earlier (e.g. Queens-
land) or simply replaced the existing jurisdiction of British trading companies
(e.g. British Columbia). Others still were claimed for Britain by enterprising
individuals on the spot without the authorization of the home government.
These, accordingly, were disavowed later (Queen Adelaide’s Land; Labuan). 34
Others were indeed new, but many of the additions were contiguous with exist-
ing holdings, such that the British state fashioned them defensive rather than
aggressive (e.g. various districts in Australia; the Punjab and Sind; Assam and
other areas northeast of India; and British Kaffraria). 35
There is a final and perhaps more important qualification: Although the
British state indeed expanded its holdings, it also rejected as many opportu-
nities to expand. This was the case even when British control was invited.
Some sectors of the Cuban elite expressed interest in Britain taking Cuba as
a colony, but London did not respond. At various times from 1838 to 1848,
the Montevideo government (in Uruguay) “offered England concessions tanta-
mount to creating a British protectorate,” but all of the offers were refused. 36
Offers came in from approximately 1838 to 1856 to take parts of present-
day California, but these were dismissed. 37 In the 1850s and 1860s, a series
of offers from chiefs in Fiji to establish a British colony flooded the Foreign
Office, but these too were rejected. 38 In the 1840s, the Dominican Republic
made overtures to turn itself over to Britain, but the response was negative. 39
The British state also refused to annex various small territories, even though
such additions would not be costly. When British merchants urged the For-
eign Office take some guano-rich islands off the coast of Peru, Her Majesty’s
Government refused to act. From 1855 to 1861, the White Rajah of Sarawak
repeatedly offered his titles to Britain, but successive governments in London
politely refused (despite reports from the ground that taking Sarawak would
halt an imposing Dutch threat, offer all kinds of mineral resources, and help

establish a route for telegraphic communication to China). 40 London likewise
refused to take Katanga in 1874. 41
Even when important trading interests were at stake, Britain did not always
extend colonial control. Consider West Africa. By mid-century, Britain had
been exporting textiles and metal goods to the Niger Delta in exchange for
vegetable oils. It also had a man on the spot, the British consul John Beecroft,
ready to be appointed colonial administrator. Again, Britain did not turn the
region into a colony. In 1865, the Parliamentary Select Committee went so far
as to recommend against colonialism entirely in most parts of Africa, even sug-
gesting that London should dispose of its existing holdings in the region (with
one or two exceptions). 42 In some cases too, Britain handed back territories.
It returned Java in 1816 and Sumatra by 1824 to the Dutch after occupying
them. In 1846, the home government disavowed D’Urban’s attempt to annex
Queen Adelaide’s Land in South Africa. 43 Britain also ceded the Bay Islands to
Honduras in 1859. 44 In 1864, Britain evacuated the Ionian Islands after having
been there for some fifty years, giving them back to Greece. 45
If these examples unsettle exceptionalism’s assumptions that the United
States has been a uniquely “reluctant” hegemon, so too should the many
instances when the British state actively supported the sovereignty of other
states. Rather than remain in Montevideo as an occupying force, the British
state encouraged the creation of the independent state of Uruguay. After the
Napoleonic Wars, the British state eventually landed on a policy of supporting
the independence of Latin American republics. Rather than seize Turkey or
its territories as the Ottoman empire weakened in the mid-nineteenth century,
Britain lent resources to promote the integrity of the Turkish state. Britain also
fought the Crimean War to protect Turkey against Russian aggression, even
as it had helped secure the independence of Greece from Turkey. Britain simi-
larly used influence of various sorts to support the independence of Tunis and
Morocco and the domains of the Sultan of Zanzibar. 46 In 1847, Britain made an
agreement with France to guarantee the independence of various islands in the
Pacific and, in accordance with its decision to not occupy Mexico, continually
supported Mexican independence. 47
The notion that the British grabbed all they could while the United States
uniquely promoted the independence of foreign states is misleading if not

false altogether. Alongside the actual annexations that took place were var-
ious refusals to expand colonial holdings and a series of policies supporting
the independence of certain foreign states. This suggests that the actions of the
British state during its period of economic hegemony hardly amount to a sin-
gular rule of territorial aggrandizement and aggression against which we can
easily assess America’s exceptionalism. To be sure, as historian John Darwin
has shown, there was little “firmness of imperial purpose” in this period; no
singular official policy, hence no official “mind” or uniform rule dictating that
the British state take new colonies. 48
If there was an official policy or overarching ideology at all, it was not about
empire but economics: specifically, free trade. This is a feature of British for-
eign policy that exceptionalist thought has run the risk of occluding by treating
free trade as somehow America’s special provenance. However, Britain articu-
lated the free trade ideal long before presumably anti-imperial Americans did.
Originating in Adam Smith and David Ricardo, the ideal surfaced strongly in
the political writings of Richard Cobden and the Manchester School. Cobden
never held political office, but his views resonated in London circles. Many
parliamentarians were tied to the rising world of finance, and so many of them
embraced the free trade dogma. 49 “Cobdenites” also had prominent policy-
making positions. The Board of Trade and its departments overseeing foreign
policy were famously pro-laissez-faire. 50 Free trade beliefs thus contributed to
liberal policies. Foreign Secretary George Canning declared in 1824 that Britain
sought “no exclusive privileges of trade . . . but equal freedom and commerce
for all.” 51 Liberalization proceeded through the 1840s with a series of bilat-
eral free trade treaties. In 1846, Britain unilaterally repealed the Corn Laws. 52
By the Cobden-Chevalier Treaty in 1860, Britain reduced tariffs with France
and extended the same reductions to all other countries. As historian Patrick
Karl O’Brien explains, this was “the most significant trade liberalization agree-
ment of the nineteenth century,” because it became a “cornerstone of a new
international trading system and an example that other European countries
emulated.” 53 Here there was no contradiction between colonies and free trade.
Britain simply opened up its colonies to foreign trade. 54
These steps to liberalize world trade were part and parcel of larger ideologies
that have been heralded as the unique provenance of the United States. One
was that Britain would serve as a leading “civilizing” force in the world. This
notion, as colonial historians are wont to show, later fed into British justifica-
tions for colonialism; but it also combined with the free trade ideal. Although
free trade was obviously good for British business, proponents argued that it

was also good for the “uncivilized” world. Lord Palmerston saw British com-
merce with Africa as a civilizing force. In 1850 he declared: “[We, i.e. the
cabinet] . . . wishing most earnestly that civilization may be extended in Africa,
being convinced that commerce is the best pioneer for civilization, and being
satisfied that there is room enough in . . . Africa for the commerce of all the civ-
ilized nations of the rest of the world, would see with pleasure every advance
of commerce in Africa, provided that such commerce was not founded on
monopoly and was not conducted upon an exclusive system.” 55 Palmerston
was also a vehement antislaver, and he used the British navy as well as treaties
to curb the trade in Africa and Latin America. This too combined with the free
trade ideology, not to mention the view of Britain as a “civilizing” and benign
force in the world. According to Palmerston, the anti–slave trade campaign was
not only “calculated to promote the interests of humanity,” but also to make
sure that “the greatest commercial benefit would accrue, not to England only,
but to every civilized nation.” 56 Lower-level officials in the heartlands agreed.
“[I]t is to the commercial supremacy of the British Empire,” said J. Snape,
councilor in Manchester, “that we must look for the advancement of freedom
and civilisation throughout the world, for the happiness and comfort of our
families at home, and for the intellectual, material, and religious progress of
the world.” He added:
I am a thorough and real Free Trader. . . . [L]et the world see that England will be at the
forefront of commercial progress, and maintain the country great, glorious, and free.
We are willing to extend those blessings to foreign nations if they will accept them upon
fair and equal terms. We ought to proclaim to foreign nations that if they will accept
our terms we are not afraid of Free Trade, and we will allow them free markets in this
country for whatever they choose to send, if they will allow us to do the same in their
country. 57
A related ideology was limited government abroad. The state should not set
up mercantilist protections or meet particularistic interests, but rather only
help expand trade. “It is the business of Government,” Palmerston wrote in
1841, “to open and secure the roads for the merchant.” 58 The ideology was
often put into practice, much to the dismay of British ventures abroad. When
British troops occupied Vera Cruz in 1862 and later departed to leave behind
an independent Mexico, London instructed the British minister of Mexico
to remember that “neither in Mexico nor in any part of the world do Her
Majesty’s Government seek any exclusive political influence, nor any commer-
cial advantages which they are not ready to share with all the nations of the
earth.” 59 British claimants and creditors in Mexico were sorely disappointed. 60

Similarly, throughout the 1840s, British commercial interests asked the gov-
ernment to pressure the Peruvian government to help them in the invaluable
guano trade. They hoped for London to use the navy to provide support to
British merchants searching for alternative guano supplies along Peru’s coast or
force the Peruvian government to reduce prices, but London was not interested
in helping them. 61 Further, as noted, the British government often refused to
annex territories in Africa, China, or the Pacific – even though British consuls
and traders often pressured for annexation to protect their particular economic
interests. 62
The ideology of laissez-faire, in fact, was intimately connected with Britain’s
refusals to expand its colonial holdings. After previous centuries of colonization
in the Americas and attendant mercantilist policies, the turn toward free trade
in the mid-nineteenth century implied that colonial economic barriers were no
longer desired; hence colonies were less desirable. 63 When Palmerston refused
to seize Abyssinia, he explained, “I do not see any advantage in our getting land
in these quarters. All we want is trade and land is not necessary for trade; we
can carry on commerce on ground belonging to other people.” 64 Palmerston
likewise explained his decision to turn away from a “crusade of conquest” in
Egypt in 1857. “We want to trade with Egypt and to travel through Egypt
but we do not want the burden of governing Egypt. Let us try to improve all
those countries by the general influence of our commerce.” 65 He famously put
it later: “We do not want Egypt or wish it for ourselves, any more than any
rational man with an estate in the north of England and a residence in the
south [for which read India] would have wished to possess the inns on the
north road. All he could want would have been that the inns should be well
kept, always accessible, and furnishing him when he came with mutton chops
and post-horses.” 66 Britain’s trade in the mid-nineteenth century would have
supported Palmerston’s view on the relative importance of economic liberalism
over neo-mercantilism and colonial preferences. The average value of Britain’s
trade with its empire was 76 million pounds between 1855 and 1859. The
value of trade with foreign countries in the same period, however, was more
than double, reaching 209 million pounds. 67
If the presumed imperial rule does not fit traditional exceptionalism’s char-
acterization, neither does British discourse match the revisionists’ claim that
the distinctiveness of American empire lies in self-denial. Britons of various
social classes sometimes denied the existence of a British empire, or at least
were barely cognizant of its existence. 68 When they were cognizant of it, they

did not always think of it as an expansive overseas political system whereby
subject races were tyrannized by British administrators. That would come later,
with the “new imperialism” of the latter part of the century. Before then, the
term British empire typically referred to the “United Kingdom of the British
Isles and to England in particular.” It was rarely if ever deployed to discuss
foreign affairs. 69 Hence, one of the handful of books that purported to examine
the “circumstances of the British Empire” in 1823 did not mention Britain’s
overseas possessions. It instead discussed issues of British trade, the Poor Laws,
and its national debt. 70 Likewise, a comprehensive guidebook on British over-
seas possessions in the east did not speak of those possessions as part of the
“British Empire in the East” but rather as the “British World in the East.” 71
The relative frequency with which the phrase “British Empire” was used is
suggestive. A word count of articles in The London Times shows that uses of
the phrase “British empire” or “our empire” were much less common in the
hegemonic period than in the period following the late 1870s (see Fig. 3.1). In
this sense, denying empire is not as distinctively American as apple pie. It may

well be that all hegemons, whether of the British or American variety, prefer
not to inscribe the sign empire on their flags or foreheads.
In light of all of this, the trajectory of British imperial historiography makes
perfect sense. In fact, ever since classic works like J. R. Seeley’s Expansion of
England (1883) and H. E. Egerton’s A Short History of British Colonial Policy
(1897), there has been a long scholarly tradition suggesting that Britain in the
mid-nineteenth century, like the United States in the mid-twentieth century, was
not exactly an empire or that, at the very least, it was not as “imperialist” as it
had been in earlier years. The tradition was continued in classic economic the-
ories of imperialism – beginning with Hobson (1902) and proceeding through
Marxian variants (such as Lenin’s theory of imperialism). These theories were
predicated on the notion that Britain in mid-century was anti-imperial or indif-
ferent to empire and that it was only imperialistic in the latter decades of the
century. Later works, such as Bodelsen’s Studies in Mid-Victorian Imperial-
ism (1924) and R. L. Schuyler’s Fall of the Old Colonial System, took up the
mantle, repeating the notion that the mid-Victorian “empire” was not quite an
empire. Even in the late 1960s, some prominent statesmen were still articulating
this notion. “The myth of the British Empire,” declared conservative parlia-
mentarian John Enoch Powell, “is one of the most extraordinary paradoxes in
political history. During the whole of the period in which Britain is imagined
to have been creating her empire, she was not only unconscious of doing any
such thing, but positively sure she was not. The Romans . . . they indeed had an
imperium which embraced almost the whole civilized world, and they said so,
and Virgil told them it was their mission to ‘rule the peoples with their sway.’
Not so the British.” 72 Conventional British historiography itself thus prefigures
traditional American exceptionalism. Both at times refused to name empire.
Persistent Territorialism
The foregoing suggests that the hegemonic British state was less imperialistic
than exceptionalist thought presumes. However, a case can also be made that
the United States after World War II was more imperialistic in the territorial
mode than conventional and critical wisdom has allowed. It is no doubt the case
that the United States granted independence to the Philippines. As noted in a
previous chapter, however, this does not mean that the United States disavowed
its empire. Out of all the territories annexed by the United States in the early
twentieth century, only the Philippines was given official independence in this
period. 73 Nonetheless, we might wonder: Did not the United States finally show
its true anticolonial character after World War II?
To answer, exceptionalist thought might not only point to decolonization
of the Philippines, but also to the fact that Puerto Rico was eventually given
72

Even this granting of independence by the United States was not unprecedented. England, for
example, gave up the Ionian Islands.118
Patterns of Empire
commonwealth status in this period. 74 Yet this is hardly evidence of an excep-
tional anticolonialism. First of all, Britain had given some of its settler colonies
a similar status decades earlier. The very label “commonwealth” had been
drawn from Britain’s imperial framework. Why isn’t Britain therefore classi-
fied as exceptionally anticolonial? Furthermore, and most important, common-
wealth status for Puerto Rico did not mean independence or decolonization.
It was even more stringent than it was for Britain’s commonwealth domin-
ions. Puerto Ricans still did not have the right to vote for the president, and
the U.S. federal government retained the right to legislate significant aspects
of Puerto Rico’s affairs. The term commonwealth obscured persistent colonial
ties. 75 Finally, to this day, the United States maintains imperial ties with these
territories. Puerto Rico has some measure of self-government, but it does not
vote for representatives to Congress or for the president of the United States.
Officially, the president can order Puerto Ricans to war, the federal government
appoints judges, and Congress can pass legislation for Puerto Rico. Something
similar persists for Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. American Samoa votes
for its own officials but is still administered by the Office of Insular Affairs in
the Department of the Interior. Citizens of these territories do not enjoy the
full protection of the U.S. Constitution. They each have internal autonomy, but
Congress officially sanctions that autonomy and could revoke it overnight if it
desired. These areas remain under the control of the U.S. federal government.
In this sense, the United States is probably the only colonial empire that has
not decolonized. By some estimates, these persistent ties make the U.S. empire
the largest territorial empire in the world today. 76
The continuation of these colonial ties was not due to indifference or iner-
tia. The colonies remained of vital value to Washington. Before World War I,
they had already shown their geostrategic value. They had been the only over-
seas locations for America’s military installations. Then, as the Second World
War ended, the colonies remained central to the American military’s strate-
gic planning. As planners were worried about sea approaches to the Western
hemisphere, Puerto Rico, Cuba’s Guantánamo Bay, and the Virgin Islands were
ever more vital. 77 The war in the Pacific had reemphasized the importance of
Guam and Samoa, and these remained central for the Pacific defense perimeter,
not least because Roosevelt’s strategies envisioned a postwar defense system
based on sea and air. This was part and parcel of a reconceptualization of what
America’s basing system should be about. Rather than merely defensive posts,
overseas bases would also serve as “springboards” for offensive action should
the need arise. Pacific bases were critical for this new system. 78

For these reasons and more, the sun had yet to set on America’s colonial
empire in the postwar period. Neil Smith – joining a larger chorus in the excep-
tionalist mode of thought – has recently intimated the irrelevance of America’s
colonies, calling them “geographical crumbs” of Spain’s disintegrated empire. 79
Yet America’s military establishment and postwar planners did not find them
irrelevant. To the contrary, they made them pivotal for their plans. If America’s
colonies were crumbs, no one in Washington could imagine American global
power without them.
If the oft-repeated claim that the United States had an empire but quickly
“gave it away” is simply wrong, so too is the assertion that the United States
failed to annex new territory after the supposed “temporary” phase of colonial
expansion in the earlier part of the century. 80 In 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and the Navy Department envisioned new acquisitions beyond those already
acquired. Foreseeing America’s victory in the war, they began plans for a new
postwar network of bases and military installations that would span the globe.
Although America’s existing colonies were important for their strategy, their
plan also called for additional colonies in the Pacific. Of immediate interest
were Japan’s former territories, later known as Micronesia (e.g., the Marshall
Islands, the Carolines, and the Marianas). Strategists also marked the Bonins,
the Ryukus, and Okinawa on their maps. These were all to be part of a new
postwar expanded American empire of the old-school variety. 81
These plans were not the only ones circulating in the minds and offices of
Washington. Various memos and documents from a number of policy com-
mittees had similar expansionist designs. Some even went further than the
early 1943 plan. They called for America to take all of Samoa rather than
just America’s existing half and to add the Japanese Kurile islands (with a
permanent population of about 18,000 inhabitants). They even called for the
seizure of the British and French colonies in the Pacific. 82 Although defense
strategists were often the first to make such calls, even civilian officials in Roo-
sevelt’s administration produced similar schemes. The Bureau of the Budget’s
plan called for direct American control over Polynesia and Micronesia; for
“adequate participation in Melanesia” (including “Fiji, New Hebrides, New
Caledonia, and Soloman Islands, the Bismarck Archipleago, New Guinea, and
adjacent islands”); and “a strong position in Indonesia.” The only question
was which agency should act as the colonial office. The War Department?
The Bureau of Insular Affairs? 83 Such plans also noted that additional Pacific
territories would not only be useful for the purposes of defense but also for
commerce. They pinpointed Southeast Asia’s raw materials and the economic

promise of Asia in its entirety. Yet proper access to the markets and materials
would demand a long string of air bases, each necessitating an operational
radius of seven hundred miles. Japan and Manila would be the main points
of access in this Pacific-Asian commercial circuit; Guam, Samoa, Hawaii, and
the new annexations would complete the chain. 84 Gunboats and commercial
boats alike would follow the flag.
These plans were widely known, so much so that the media began speaking
affirmatively of a new “American colonial empire” in the Pacific. 85 Only Rupert
Emerson, writing in Pacific Affairs, noted the irony: “It is a curious coincidence
that the United States, just at the time when it is by its own voluntary act
surrendering control over the Philippines, should be in the process of fathering
to itself a new empire in the Pacific.” 86 Still, the idea of an expanded colonial
empire and additional colonial subjects was warmly welcomed by at least some
sectors in the United States. An informal poll of American legislators revealed
that congressmen and senators favored annexation of the Japanese islands by
two to one. 87 “I want those islands,” declared Tom Connally, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 88 None of it was lost on British observers.
The Earl of Halifax, writing to the London Foreign Office from Washington,
warned his superiors of “the straight jingoes in Congress and beyond who want
annexation.” 89 Sir Frederick Eggleston added: “The Americans are very keen
on this . . . strategic area [in the Pacific], and it gives a lie to the lot of their
absurd criticism of the [European] colonial system before the war.” 90
The culture of old-world imperialism and great-power politics persisted into
the post–World War II days – to the victor go the spoils. In this case, how-
ever, the outcome was only slightly different. While the military establishment,
the American public, and American legislators clamored for colonial annexa-
tion, the State Department pushed for a more moderate stance. Working most
closely with the Allies amid the postwar negotiations, the State Department
felt pressure from the British and French to turn the Japanese territories into
international mandates rather than taking them outright. After much delib-
eration, the State Department recommended the mandate approach, fearing
that America’s recolonization would justify a new scramble for territory on the
part of the European allies and Russia. Harold Ickes in the Department of the
Interior agreed. Directly annexing Pacific territories would permit any one of
the Allies to claim the same rights in the Middle East, thereby threatening “our
great stake in Middle Eastern oil.” 91 A fierce battle in Washington ensued,

marking – as the British ambassador reported – “a rift in the American family
on this issue.” 92
The final result was a strategic compromise. Rather than making the islands
a proper United Nations Trust Territory, the Joint Chiefs of Staff successfully
pushed to turn them into a “Strategic Trust Territory.” This was an entirely new
category of international mandates, created for this case only. It was an attempt
to give the appearance of international supervision, but it left the United States
with full direct control. The Navy Department was given the task of acting as
a colonial administration, with power to legislate for the islands as it pleased.
The Pentagon later boasted that the United Nations had a veneer of control.
In effect, the United States “retained all the attributes of sovereignty.” 93 The
U.K. delegation to the negotiations correctly wrote home that the plan simply
gave the United States “a free hand in these islands except for nominal control
by the [UN] Security Council.” 94 Rupert Emerson wrote in Pacific Affairs that
the trusteeship policy is “virtually indistinguishable from annexation.” 95 The
American press was not mistaken either. A Washington Post editorial reported,
“the United States is taking over a vast empire of four million square miles in the
Pacific.” 96 Decolonizing the Philippines, the American state simply recolonized
the rest of the Pacific.
The Form of Informal Empire
The foregoing suggests that the American state was not as anticolonial as
conventional narratives portray. Rather than transcending the territorialism of
old-world imperialism, the American postwar state persisted in and depended
on it. But there is a final sense in which the American state was more colonialist
than exceptionalist or even revisionist stories would suggest. Those stories
conjure how Roosevelt and his aides in the aftermath of World War II pushed
for the decolonization of European empires, but they overlook the fact that
the postwar American state actually supported the European empires. Leaders
and policy makers may have talked a big game about a world of independent
nation-states (talk that scholars today continue to see as exemplifying a unique
American anticolonialism), but they did little in practice after World War II
to match their rhetoric with reality. Until the 1960s or so, Washington lent
the European empires critical funds so as to keep their colonial systems intact.
Rather than pushing for their end, the United States came to rely on and
purposively deploy the empires about which they spoke so negatively.

Patterns of Empire
We will learn more about this in a later chapter. For now, we should turn
to other ways in which the United States was more imperial than conventional
exceptionalism would allow. After all, the foregoing discussion about colonial-
ism measures empire in a restrictive way. Looking for all the spots marked red
on the map, it classifies empire as a matter of territorial acquisition and direct
colonial rule. Are there are not other ways in which states can be “imperial”
besides colonial annexation? We come here to critics of traditional exception-
alism who suggest that although the United States did not construct a colonial
empire, it was imperial nonetheless – if only because it embarked on a differ-
ent brand of imperialism, a particular “American way of empire.” This type
of imperialism is worth exploring further. It is also worthy of comparative
investigation.
An “American Way of Empire”?
Already in 1951, an article in The Nation’s Business noted something of this
particular American way of empire. Reporting on America’s new overseas bas-
ing system (still dependent on Europe’s colonies), it contended: “Some nations
achieve empire, while others have empire thrust upon them. It’s hardly news to
Americans that world-wide responsibility has been laid on their doorstep like an
unwanted foundling. . . . This new American imperialism (and let’s not boggle
at the term until we’ve redefined it in terms of mid-century realities) is based
firmly on a curving line of aerial outposts from Iceland to the Azores; from
French Morocco on the eastern shore of the Atlantic to Libya on the southern
shore of the Mediterranean.” 97 In calling this basing system imperialistic, this
writer for the Nation’s Business was probably uniquely astute for his time.
The British ambassador in Washington wrote home amidst the debate over
the Japanese territories in 1945: “Bases do not seem to most Americans to be
colonies in the unpopular sense of the word.” 98 Still, the notion that America’s
global network of bases constituted a sort of “empire” has been raised in the
revisionist histories first produced by William A. Williams and the Wisconsin
School. In these histories, if the United States did not construct a new formal
colonial empire, it did establish a string of overseas military installations that
stand as new American versions of old-style colonies.
Beyond America’s basing system, however, there were other means of exer-
cising power. Something of this is seen in the case of Philippine independence.
In theory, Philippine independence meant national freedom, but in practice it
came with various strings. The Bell Trade Act, which specified the economic
conditions for granting independence, pegged the Philippine peso to the U.S.
dollar. It also required that the new Philippine constitution provide U.S. citizens
and corporations access to Philippine raw materials and specified duty-free and
quota-free trade between the United States and the Philippines. 99 Independence

also came with military strings. Before the granting of independence, the Philip-
pine president, Manuel Roxas, signed a preliminary statement with President
Truman binding the archipelago to a future military agreement. In 1947, the
Military Bases Agreement granted the United States the use of twenty-three
bases in the archipelago for at least ninety-nine years. A few days later, another
agreement was signed. The Military Assistance Agreement provided that the
United States would arm and train the Philippine armed forces and offer other
services (such as intelligence). It also set up a Joint U.S. Military Advisory
group “to assist and advise the Republic of the Philippines on military and
naval matters.” 100
These provisions are notable because they enabled the United States to use
the Philippines as it always had when it exercised direct colonial rule – namely,
for capital accumulation and as a nodal point in its network of national secu-
rity. Congressman Jasper Bell fittingly remarked that the Bell Trade Act would
“recreate our sixth best customer in world commerce.” 101 The South could
regain a market for its cotton; New England for its textiles; and dairy pro-
ducers for their diary. Similarly, the prolonged presence of the U.S. military
helped to round out America’s Asia-Pacific defense system, connecting bases in
Europe’s colonies and America’s own colonies. 102 In short, although the Philip-
pines became nominally independent, the United States retained influence and
control, enabling it to fulfill traditional imperial imperatives. The more things
changed, the more they stayed the same.
Of course, the form of this influence and control was different than before.
American colonial governors, backed by colonial armies and policing, no longer
ran the show. Formal colonial control was over; the United States no longer
claimed sovereignty; it could not influence the islands’ political and economic
system by direct command. Yet the United States nonetheless exercised power
to fulfill its wider economic and strategic goals. First, it exploited unequal
economic conditions. When the Bell Trade Act was offered to the Philippine
legislature, it stipulated that if the legislature accepted it, not only would the
country receive independence, but also $800 million in U.S. aid for recon-
structing the country – funds that were vital for the war-ravaged archipelago.
Second, the United States exploited internal divisions to cultivate clients. The
Bell Trade Act provided Americans access to Philippine resources, but it like-
wise helped the Philippine sugar elite who had come to depend on access to
American markets. 103 Similarly, the new president, Manuel Roxas, had been

The value of the Philippine bases in particular was later demonstrated over and over again. In
1950, in response to the outbreak of the Korean War, they served as the jumping point for
patrolling the line between Communist China and Taiwan, presumably to defend the latter
from a Red Army invasion. Later in the decade, Philippine bases were used for operations in
Indonesia against President Sukarno, whose Communist orientation had struck fear into State
Department officials.

facing the threat of Communist revolution in the countryside. He needed Amer-
ican military support and aid to quell it if he was to retain power. He therefore
accepted the new military agreements for U.S. bases, but only after American
emissaries had threatened to withdraw U.S. troops if the base agreement was
not accepted. 104 In short, rather than controlling the islands by the threat of
direct force or an imposed foreign colonial governor, the United States offered
Filipino leaders money and military support. Colonial subjects became free cit-
izens of their own sovereign nation, but they also became allies and dependent
clients, propped to help fulfill America’s post–World War II imperatives. In
some ways, this new relationship was even better than before. As Yale political
scientist David Nelson Rowe told a meeting of foreign policy makers in Octo-
ber 1946, “the United States is actually in a stronger position in the Philippines
although the islands are independent now.” 105
The end of U.S. rule in the Philippines has been taken by exceptionalist his-
toriography and contemporaries alike as a model for an anticolonial postwar
order based on American values, but it can also be taken as exemplifying a new
way of empire. After noting that the conditions of Philippine independence put
the United States in a stronger position than before, David Nelson Rowe added
that the same type of “economic, cultural, and military relations through the
consent of new governments might well be applied to other territories in the
Far East.” 106 This was exactly what happened, even beyond Asia, leading to
the construction of a wider network of power constituting an informal empire.
Unlike in the Philippines, the tactics here did not always involve constitution
writing. Only in precious few areas could the United States actually control
that process (Japan, for one). Instead, the tactics entailed flows of favors and
exchanges alongside and around America’s existing colonial empire – punctu-
ated by covert and overt military operations to help establish and defend the
network.
Latin America provides examples. The United States made it a near offi-
cial policy to support military and dictatorial regimes there, turning power-
ful elements in the region into friendly clients akin to colonial collaborators.
Beginning in 1946, American officials began selling military equipment to Latin
America, guided by the notion that this was an effective way to influence local
affairs. In a secret hearing to Congress on the policy, a representative from the
War Department explained: “In those cases where the army or the navy does
not actually run the government, they come so close to it that any influence on
them has great national importance to those countries. Our military missions
there are working with the most influential people in those governments.” 107

nization of American States established the Inter-American Defense College in

Washington to train Latin American military officials, insisting that the military
would serve as a “force for stability” in the region. 108 In 1964, a joint report of
the State and Defense Departments reiterated that the “potential for advancing
US interests and objectives through effective US influence upon the Latin Amer-
ica military is great” and so attached “highest” priority to continued relations
with Latin American military officers. 109
The results of this approach should be familiar. To take just one example,
the 1948 military junta in Venezuela resulted in a decade of military rule. Com-
bined aid from the United States jumped from $.5 million per year (on average)
before the junta to an average of $4 million per year afterward (plus about $54
million in U.S. loans). 110 Similarly, in Bolivia, an overthrow of the Villarroel
regime in 1952 established the rule of Victor Paz Estenssoro, and U.S. economic
aid subsequently heightened. When his regime became recalcitrant in the early
1960s, his military overthrew him with American support. 111 At issue in all of
these relationships was the same issue guiding America’s support of Europe’s
colonial empire: capital and containment. But in fact, until the Cuban Revolu-
tion, the issue was less Communist penetration than it was economic security.
The 1948 overthrow in Venezuela was good for the United States because the
overthrown Acción Democrática regime had threatened U.S.-owned oil compa-
nies. After the State Department recognized the new junta and stepped up aid,
U.S. oil companies regained access and reinvigorated their profits. In Bolivia,
the Paz regime was unabashedly Marxist in tone, but the United States sup-
ported it because the previous regime had threatened American tin interests. 112
Such activities helped create a boon for American companies. From 1951 to
1955, profits on all U.S. investment in Latin America were 13.9 percent, and
from 1956 to 1958, they were 12.0 percent; corporate profits in the United
States during the same eight-year period were only 7.8 percent. 113
Beyond supporting already-existing regimes or capitalizing on coups, the
United States also played a more direct hand in installing friendly client regimes,
often through covert or overt operations. In Brazil in 1964, covert encour-
agement, previous American training of local military officers, and the pres-
ence of offshore U.S. naval units helped the military overthrow João Goulert’s
presidency. Goulert had threatened American interests with a land reform
program, limitations on foreign capital, and friendly recognition of Cuba. 114
The new president, General Castelo Branco, swiftly became a close American
ally. 115 Ten years earlier, one of the first overt U.S. military interventions after

Patterns of Empire
World War II had taken place in Guatemala, leading to the ousting of Arbenz,
whose regime had threatened the United Fruit Company. The CIA began a
campaign to overthrow him. A U.S. aircraft attack in 1954 authorized by
President Eisenhower helped finish the job. 116 The result was the installation
of Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas, who, along with other Guatemalans, had
been trained by the CIA in nearby Honduras (another client state of the U.S.
military). 117
These sorts of tactics were generalized throughout the region. After the over-
throw of Arbenz, John Foster Dulles said that the military dictators in Latin
America “are the only people we can depend on.” 118 But the creation and sup-
port of client states – sometimes by the hand of covert activity or overt military
operations – were not restricted to the Western hemisphere. In the Middle East,
and in Iran in particular, clientelism became an important mechanism of influ-
ence too. After World War II, Iran quickly became a centerpiece of strategy in
the region. As the war showed signs of ending, the State Department warned
of Soviet attempts to gain oil concessions there; it therefore suggested that the
United States ensure Iranian independence. The stated goal was to “construct
a strong and independent Iran, free from the internal dissensions and weak-
nesses which invite foreign intervention” (not unlike the goal of the British state
in regard to the failing Ottoman empire in the nineteenth century). 119 How-
ever, when Prime Minister Mohammed Mussadiq threatened to nationalize the
oil fields beginning in 1950, the situation became untenable. Nationalization
threatened existing Anglo-American oil ventures and made Soviet access more
likely. In response, the United States and its allies overthrew Mossadiq and
replaced him with the Shah. Observers were not mistaken. “There is on our
side,” wrote Sir Roger Makins, the British ambassador in Washington, after
the overthrow, “a very understandable suspicion that the Americans are out
to take our place in the Middle East. Their influence has greatly expanded
there. . . . Are the Americans consciously trying to substitute their influence for
ours in the Middle East?” 120
Makins’s query was on the spot, except that it did not only apply to the Mid-
dle East. Around the globe, the American state maneuvered to fill the spaces
left behind by the ailing European empires. As we will see in the next chapter,
the United States had initially supported the European empires in the postwar
period. As those empires nevertheless began to implode, however, the United
States was forced to withdraw its support and instead find other means to exert
influence. The American state used the tactics it had been using in Latin Amer-
ica and Iran. In the Congo, various types of U.S. intervention in the wake of

Belgium’s decolonization led to the establishment of Joseph-Désiré Mobutu’s
brutal dictatorial regime. 121 Close to half of all of America’s financial aid to
Africa thus went to him. 122 American financial power replaced Belgian colo-
nial power. In Vietnam, by 1954 the United States was subsidizing about 40
percent of the entire French effort to squash the Communist nationalist move-
ment there. 123 When French forces were defeated at Dien Bien Phu in 1954,
the United States was forced to disavow its support and step in directly. The
result is well known: the creation of a client state and desperate continued
military efforts to defend it, ending with the Vietnam War. In Indonesia, ini-
tial attempts by the Eisenhower administration to win over President Sukarno
failed. Sukarno publicly told the United States: “Go to hell with your aid.” 124
A CIA-backed coup attempt in 1958 failed miserably, as did attempts to fund
the Indonesia military in the hopes that it would serve as an alternative center
of power. 125 Success only came later, after the United States supported the
coup by General Suharto and subsequently enlisted him as America’s client. 126
Washington was happy. Walt W. Rostow, national security adviser and pro-
ponent of modernization theory, told President Johnson: “Suharto is making
a hard try at making something of Indonesia which could be very good for us
and the world.” 127
Informal Empire in Comparative Context
The fact that the United States did not initiate a new round of colonization
after acquiring the Japanese territories does not mean a lack of empire. It sim-
ply meant a different type of empire. In this empire, clients took the place of
colonies, and financial aid took the place of administrators. The revisionists’
approach would be affirmed. America engaged in a new imperialism without
colonies. Yet our story cannot end with a simple affirmation of the revisionist
approach. There is a certain strand of revisionism that we must further interro-
gate. In this strand, the foregoing informal exercises of empire manifest a dis-
tinct “American way of empire.” This is one way in which American exception-
alism has been reinscribed amidst the revisionist critique. Presumably, whereas
the British empire was constituted by colonies and colonial administrators,
durbars, and pith helmets, America’s empire in the twentieth century stands
distinct for employing “novel” and “creative” indirect means of influence. 128
If the United States has had “an informal empire,” this just shows that “Amer-
icans, unlike the Romans, the British, and the French, are not colonizers of

remote and exotic places.” 129 America’s informal imperialism, in other words,
is itself exceptional.
British activities in West Africa in the mid-nineteenth century tell a different
story. The British exerted formal control in some parts of the region. Britain
established the Gold Coast Settlements in 1842 and seized Lagos in 1861. 130
However, in the late 1840s and early 1850s, before the seizure of Lagos,
Palmerston tried to force King Kosoko in Lagos to accept a treaty that would
have met Britain’s goals without declaring sovereignty. He had instructed the
admiralty to “induce [Kosoko] to conclude a Treaty for the abolition of that
[slave] traffic.” The treaty would have also opened up the area to commerce. 131
King Kosoko, however, proved intractable – he refused to sign it. In response,
Captain John Beecroft, who had been appointed consul to the region, led
a British naval force in 1851 to depose King Kosoko and replace him with
the ex-king, Akiyote, whom the British saw as more “docile” and amenable to
British interests. 132 Lagos remained formally sovereign and Akiyote, as Britain’s
client, was now in charge. Consul Beecroft hung around as Akiyote’s unofficial
supervisor (1852). 133 A decade later, when it was finally decided to annex
Lagos, the Foreign Office astutely noted that annexation was but the tip of the
iceberg because “the Consul [Beecroft] in fact for some years has been the de
facto ruler of the place.” 134
The overthrow of Kosoko was but one instance among many informal impe-
rial tactics in coastal Africa. Britain repeatedly tried to induce local rulers to
accept treaties that would curb the slave trade, open up commerce, and pre-
vent French expansion. 135 To compel local rulers to accept the treaties, Britain
offered subsidies, stipends, promises of protection, or portions of trade revenue.
By the 1860s, an estimated 107 such treaties had been signed throughout East
Africa. 136 When local rulers did not sign treaties or violated their terms, over-
throw was the norm. In 1852, Beecroft deposed King Aqua in the Cameroons
and replaced him with “Prince Jim” on the grounds that Aqua was a “drunken
imbecile, a liar, and a great rogue” who had been hampering British trade. 137
Beecroft similarly helped overthrow King Pepple of Bonny (later Nigeria), who
had been “doing all in his power to obstruct and annoy us in our trade.”
Beecroft thus replaced Pepple with Prince Dappo, in whose honor British war-
ships fired twenty-one guns. 138 In the 1840s, the British also cultivated the

Imam of Zanzibar and Muscat, Seyyid Said, as a key collaborator along the
coast to help curb slave trafficking, limit French designs, and increase Africa’s
trade with India. In exchange for Said’s support, British agents helped him
expand into neighboring terrain and suppress local resistance to his author-
ity. British agents boasted that Said was being used “as a powerful political
engine.” 139
It is not difficult to see how the use of African clients, through manipulation,
bribes, and other forms of support, prefigured America’s support of African
dictators during the Cold War. Yet the British state employed informal tactics
in other regions of the world too. Return to Latin America. As noted, the
British state refused to colonize parts of Latin America and supported the
independence of Latin American countries, but this was not because Britain
had no interests there. To the contrary, the region remained a vital economic
interest, necessary (as Lord Castlereagh had put it) for “the extension of our
own commerce.” 140 Rather than directly colonizing the region, however, the
British state cultivated allies and clients. 141 Britain’s relations with Uruguay are
exemplary: In fact, the very establishment of Uruguay as a nation was made
possible by Britain’s hand. Known previously as the Banda Orientál, the area
had been valued by Britain, Argentina (the United Provinces), Brazil, and the
United States for its riverways, which offered important trading routes into the
interior. However, in 1821 Brazil laid claim to the area, and four years later war
erupted between Brazil and Argentina over the territory. The war threatened
British commerce and aroused fears that the United States might extend its own
influence in the region. The solution was to create an independent Banda, and
accordingly Britain’s minister to Buenos Aires aided local Banda leaders to form
a nationalist separatist party. The subsequent independent nation of Uruguay
served London as a crucial “buffer state” between Brazil and Argentina. 142
Although independent, Uruguay became a British client. As the U.S. consul
general in Buenos Aires assessed, it was but “a [British] Colony in disguise.” 143
These tactics were not unusual elsewhere in the world where Britain had
interests. In 1832, Britain supported the independence of Greece from the
Ottoman empire only to turn it into yet another client state. After helping to
install Bavaria’s King Otto to the Greek throne, Britain gave loans and induced
trade treaties aimed at facilitating British commerce. In similar fashion, the
British state arranged for a treaty with the sultan in Morocco (1856) that effec-
tively established Morocco as a quasi-protectorate and opened it up to British
trade and investment. 144 To convince the sultan to accept the treaty, the Foreign
Office instructed Drummond Hay, the British minister at Tangier, to tell the

sultan that if he accepted the treaty, Britain would “prove the value which [he]
entertained for the friendship and goodwill of the British Government.” 145
Hay also subtly threatened the sultan with the British navy; after the sultan
finally agreed, Hay remained as British minister at Tangier. 146 Loans, military
support, and training followed. 147
Political support and financial incentives thus helped to sustain Britain’s
informal imperial network. However, the use of force played no less a role.
As with the United States later, the British state sought to open up trade, but
this sometimes involved the use of coercion to open up markets in the first
place. “It may be true in one sense,” wrote Palmerston in 1860, expressing the
classic mid-Victorian dilemma, “that trade ought not to be enforced by cannon
balls, but on the other hand trade cannot flourish without security, and that
security may often be unattainable without the exhibition of physical force.” 148
Accordingly, the overthrow of King Kosoko at Lagos had been prefaced by
threats. Palmerston had sent instructions to Beecroft stating that, if Kosoko
did not meet British interests, he should be reminded that “Britain’s friendship
is worth having and that her displeasure it is well to avoid,” that “Lagos is
near to the sea and . . . on the sea are the ships and the cannon of England.” 149
Palmerston was not overstating British power. All along the coasts of Africa,
the Royal Navy remained on call, ready to be summoned “to rescue traders,
coerce African rulers, or compel the signature of commercial treaties.” 150
Latin America saw similar threats and uses of force. To establish Uruguay
as a buffer state, Britain had to threaten Brazil with naval intervention. Later,
in the 1840s, the navy was used to protect trading routes in Uruguay from
incursions by Argentina. 151 A blockade was used in 1848 and 1849 to compel
Brazil to adhere to antislaving policies and again in 1862 to retaliate against
the seizure of a British trading ship. British forces were also used to punish the
rulers of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli for attacking British ships and threatening
trade (1816); to support Greek independence against Turkish forces (1827);
to support the integrity of the Ottoman empire against Mehemet Ali’s attempt
to separate Egypt (1840); to occupy Veracruz in 1861 in response to Mexico’s
cancellation of its foreign debt; and to attack Japan in order to keep the Simo-
noeski Straits open to foreign trade (1864). These and many other smaller
deployments were common. Although systematic data is not obtainable, it is
known that navy gunboats were called upon by consulars, traders, or governors
around the globe at least 116 times from 1857 to 1861 alone. 152 When overt
force was not used, Britain resorted to clandestine operations. In a campaign to

compel Brazil’s rulers to end the slave trade, British operatives used Secret Ser-
vice funds to “finance informants, bribe officials, and subsidize newspapers.” 153
Clandestine activities were also used in 1839 to replace the intractable ruler
of Afghanistan, Dost Mohammed, with a client ruler who would help thwart
Russian intervention.
Britain also initiated more massive military campaigns than gunboat diplo-
macy or small covert operations. The Opium Wars against China stand out
clearly (1840–1842; 1858–1860). After the wars, although Britain did not
annex Chinese territory, it did leave behind a series of treaties that pried China
open for foreign trade, imposed protections for British citizens and diplomats,
and established the Tsungli-yamen in 1861 (which provided Western diplo-
mats with an office for pressing demands on the government) as well as a
new customs office. 154 A number of cities were also established as “treaty
ports.” Precursors to free trade zones, these provided various legal protections
for foreign traders. They ranged in size “from 25 acres in the tea-exporting
Yangtze port of Kiuiang (Jijuiang) to more than 1,000 acres in the North
Ciense metropolis of Tientsin (Tianjin).” 155 The treaties, made possible by the
hand of force, eventually had their desired economic effect. The total value
of British exports to China increased from 640,000 pounds during the period
1844 to 1846 to about 1.1 million pounds ten years later. 156 Trade followed
the gunboat.
So what was new about America’s informal imperialism? Nothing at all.
Yet this would not be unfamiliar to followers of Robinson and Gallagher. It
was Robinson and Gallagher’s analysis of mid-Victorian foreign policy that
popularized the concept “informal imperialism” in the first place. 157 They con-
tended with traditional imperial historiography that had long claimed that the
mid-Victorian British state was anti-imperial. Robinson and Gallagher argued
instead that although the British state was not as colonialist as it had been pre-
viously (or would be later), this did not mean that it was anti-imperial. To say
so – as traditional or “orthodox” imperial histories did – would be to operate
from a restricted territorial or colonial definition of empire, “which is rather like
judging the size and character of icebergs solely from the parts above the water-
line.” 158 Robinson and Gallagher then disclosed all the ways the British state,
although reluctant to take new colonies, simply exercised imperialism in the
“informal” mode: “[P]ower was extended in subtler forms [than annexation] –
prestige, cajolery, threat, the dangled loan reinforced occasionally with block-
ade, bombardment or expedition.” 159 According to Robinson and Gallagher,

these were the preferred methods of the British state until the late nineteenth
century. “London resorted to one expedient after another to evade the need
of formal expansion.” 160 The British state, in short, “followed the principle of
extending control informally if possible and formally [only] if necessary.” 161 In
this sense, America’s informal empire was but a new variant of an older theme.
As Wm. Roger Louis notes: “Robinson and Gallagher’s Victorians would have
recognized the methods of post World War II Americans.” 162
Yet the similarity does not stop here. Even the respective historiographies of
British and American empires are similar. In American historiography, a certain
sequence unfolded from traditional exceptionalism to revisionism. Traditional
exceptionalism asserted that the United States was not an empire during the
mid-twentieth century because it did not seize new colonies. Then Williams’s
revisionism and his Wisconsin School emerged to declare that the United States
was an empire, but of an informal sort. Studies of the British empire fol-
low the exact same trajectory. As noted, orthodox histories at first denied
that Britain was imperial in the mid-nineteenth century. Then, beginning with
Robinson and Gallagher’s seminal work, historians reconsidered British activ-
ities to say that Britain was indeed an empire in the mid-nineteenth century,
however of an informal sort. Even American historiography on empire is not
so exceptional. 163

Imperial Forms, Global Fields
Colonialism is successful where the subject people are unsophisticated and acqui-
escent, as in the case of certain South Pacific islanders. Once the dependent
people, even if a small minority of them, acquire a degree of worldly wisdom
and personal ambition, complications set in. Discontent, resistance, and political
psychoses develop.

In what ways has the U.S. imperial formation differed from Britain’s? It is
not the lack of overseas colonies. Nor is it that the U.S. colonial empire was
more benign or liberal, that the U.S. empire was uniquely informal, or that
its citizens refused to speak the empire’s name. Rather, one important differ-
ence remains. Whereas both the U.S. and British imperial formations involved
colonies, and whereas both entailed informal modalities of power – cultivating
clients, cajoling enemies, and deploying military force – only the British empire
mixed informal and formal tactics during its period of hegemony. In the mid-
nineteenth century, the British crafted allies, invaded countries, and employed
various other informal tactics while also seizing overseas territory as colonial
dependencies. The British state did not seize as many colonies during its period
of hegemony as it did during its period of hegemonic ascent (a point to be
considered later). Yet it did seize some. Alternatively, during its comparable
phase of hegemony, the U.S. empire did not seize multiple new colonies. In
1947, it annexed the former Japanese mandates, but afterward the American
state relied exclusively on informal imperialism. Whereas the British empire

was formal and informal at once after 1815, the United States empire shifted
from formal to informal after 1947.
This is a significant difference indeed. Perhaps it is what gives credence to
exceptionalist claims about American uniqueness. So what accounts for it?
Why did the United States turn away from colonialism as a preferred mode
of imperialism during its period of hegemony, whereas Britain mixed and
mingled the modes? Existing works that have discussed America’s informal
imperium from the mid-twentieth century onward have not yet offered full
explanations. The only ones on offer reinscribe exceptionalist themes. In these
explanations, the United States resorted to more informal modes of exercising
power because of its own national character and institutions. Firmly rooted
in “democratic and anti-imperial features,” as one historian of the postwar
period puts it, the United States restrained from practicing colonialism and
could only employ informal tactics that, although still imperialistic, nonethe-
less respected the integrity of national sovereignty. “The United States, in part
because of its democratic structure, pursued policies of ‘guns and butter.’” It
“mobilized Americans for war but not for permanent foreign occupations.” 3
Historian and former White House official Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. likewise sug-
gests that the United States turned to informal imperialism rather than colonial
rule because there has been “no sustained demand for empire” in the United
States. The minor “spasm” of imperial enthusiasm at the turn of the twentieth
century aside, the empire has faced “consistent indifference and resistance”
from its democratically minded citizens. Accordingly, informal imperialism,
which is “marginal to the subject of direct control,” has been the preferred
option. 4
As an explanation, however, this account runs into trouble. Something of
the trouble can be seen if we consider an event in the 1950s: Senator John
Kennedy’s speech on Algeria and the responses to it. This is fitting because
Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., who offered an exceptionalist explanation for Amer-
ica’s informal imperialism, later served under Kennedy. In 1957, Kennedy gave
a speech supporting Algerian independence from France. He referred to “impe-
rialism” as “the enemy of freedom” and decried America’s “retreat from the
principles of independence and anticolonialism” by not supporting the Alge-
rian revolutionaries. According to exceptionalist thought, this should not be
unusual: It is just another manifestation of America’s anticolonial values. Yet
Kennedy’s speech was hardly without controversy. While colleagues and some
sectors of the public supported him in his stance (African American civil rights
leaders were among them), his speech also drew criticism. After it was publi-
cized, his office received hundreds of letters from citizens across the country
attacking him for his anticolonial stance, for “butting in with France’s affairs,”
3

135
and for “lacking a great deal of basic information” on French colonialism. 5
In fact, these latter views were much closer to America’s official stance on
Algeria: In 1956, the previous year, the United States refused to support a
United Nations declaration in support of Algerian independence.
The different responses to Kennedy’s speech manifest a complexity that
belies the exceptionalist account for American imperial practices. Exceptional-
ism’s explanation for America’s turn away from colonialism after the Second
World War posits a monolithic anticolonial political culture at home that
directly dictated U.S. foreign policy. The divergent responses to Kennedy’s
stance on Algeria betray any such notion. Nor is this unique. In previous chap-
ters, we have seen other examples of this ambiguity. Immediately after the
Second World War, politicians scrambled to take the former Japanese terri-
tories, making no attempt to hide their designs, and sectors of the American
public supported them. Gallup polls taken in 1944 showed that the majority
of Americans wanted their government to take not only the former colonies of
Japan but also those of Britain. 6 Seventy percent, in fact, responded affirma-
tively to a question asked by pollsters: “After the war should the United States
keep all of the Japanese islands which we conquer between Hawaii and the
Philippines?” 7 Of course, wartime enthusiasm may have pushed these procolo-
nial sentiments beyond normalcy, but the point is that the exceptionalists’ tacit
assumption that the American public or politicians have been uniformly anti-
colonial, such that American foreign policy simply reflects these anticolonial
values, simply does not hold.
The real issue, as we will see in this chapter, is not just that the excep-
tionalist explanation posits a uniform and static political culture that shapes
policy. It is that the exceptionalist explanation focuses narrowly on domes-
tic or national factors. It highlights events, processes, structures within the
imperial metropole. This is a classic metropolitan-centered account. It explains
imperial actions abroad by ideas, actors, beliefs, or institutions at home. A dif-
ferent approach would widen the lens. It would look beyond domestic political
cultures, institutions, electorates, or “national character” and toward global
structures. It would think harder about the wider international or global con-
text in which the American state had to operate and compare it with the global
context in which the British state operated in the nineteenth century. In brief,
rather than pointing to metropolitan characteristics to explain imperial poli-
cies, it would take seriously the very global structures and relations or global
fields in which empires had to maneuver. 8 This is the approach taken in this
chapter.

Patterns of Empire
Outsourcing Empire
What was different about the global fields in which the United States and Britain
operated during their respective periods of hegemonic maturity? One difference
lies in political ecology. Scholarship on the expansion of the international sys-
tem suggests that the political ecology of the nineteenth-century global system
can be divided into three basic political units: (1) recognized sovereign nation-
states, (2) colonial dependencies of sovereigns, and (3) unrecognized territories
and polities that have not been incorporated into the Western-based state sys-
tem. The first category was European-based and contained the seeds for the
modern nation-state: It included those powerful states emerging from the West-
phalia system to constitute members of “international society.” They engage
in formal treaties with each other and see each other as equal sovereigns. 9 The
other two categories consisted of non-Western polities without sovereignty.
Dependencies or colonies are “entities that sovereigns claim to possess or
control.” 10 Those polities known as “unrecognized” constitute the frontier
of the sovereign system: They are neither formally subordinated to metropoli-
tan states as dependences, but neither are they recognized as sovereign by
the existing sovereign states. Of course, for the Africans, Pacific Islanders, or
Asians who lived in these societies, their polities were perfectly recognizable
and legitimate. But “unrecognized” here refers to the perception of the West-
ern sovereign states. Polities known as “unrecognized” were “considered by
Western states to be outside Western state society.” 11
Following this scheme, there were important differences between the British
and U.S. periods of hegemony (see Table 4.1). One key difference is that in the
first half of the nineteenth century most of the world (65 percent of the earth’s
land surface) consisted of unrecognized territories. Sovereign states, centered
in Europe, took up only about 24 percent of the earth’s land surface, and their
colonial dependencies took up 11 percent. Even in 1878, just before the great
imperial scramble, 32 percent of the world’s land surface was unrecognized,
mostly in Africa. Imperialism at the turn of the century then turned all of Africa
into dependent territory. Therefore, by the time the United States reached
hegemony in the mid-twentieth century, the field was radically different from
when the British ruled. In 1946, only 16 percent of the world’s land surface was
unrecognized; the rest was occupied by European empires. The United States
entered a global field wherein most of the world had already been colonized.
This is a simple but important difference. As studies of imperialism show,
sovereign states tend to seize only unrecognized territories. 12 They are less
likely to colonize either other sovereign states or even colonial dependencies
of other sovereigns (except as “spoils of war”). This makes sense: Colonizing

the territory of another sovereign state is an arduous task, a zero-sum game
that would have to be resolved through outright purchase or war between
sovereigns. However, unrecognized territories do not involve these complica-
tions. They appear as frontier areas ready for the taking, with comparably
little worry about rival claims. It follows that the more unrecognized terri-
tory there is in the world, the more opportunities there are for colonization.
This is why, as the historian Dominic Lieven points out, European empires
could more easily expand outside Europe than within it. Whereas annexing
recognized territories in Europe brought all kinds of jealousies, rivalries, and
tensions, territorial aggrandizement outside of Europe – into “unrecognized”
territory – was far easier. 13
We might already see how these different field configurations impacted
British and American imperial forms. Most obviously, the fact that there was
less unrecognized territory in the mid-twentieth century served as a constraint
on American colonization, whereas the fact that there was so much more in the
previous century means that there were more opportunities for the British state
to colonize. To be sure, the vast majority of the colonies Britain acquired from
1816 to the early 1870s had neither been sovereign states nor dependencies of
another sovereign. They were unrecognized territories. Yet because the United
States entered a field dominated by sovereign states (e.g. in Latin America) and
vast territorial empires that took up most of the globe, it had fewer oppor-
tunities to colonize than Britain had. There was much less land to grab and
fewer foreign peoples available to rule. For this reason alone – regardless of
whatever anticolonial “values” or “national character” the United States might

Patterns of Empire
have had – the American state was simply less likely to institute a new round
of colonialism in the mid-twentieth century.
This is only one part of the story, however. The United States emerged
victorious from World War II, which proved its superior military strength, and
European powers were becoming weak and dependent upon U.S. economic
aid. In this situation, the United States might have taken European colonies by
showing its new muscles. It might have taken colonies without too much fear of
reprisal from its weak counterparts. So why not? Here arises the other critical
difference between the global fields of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
Given that so much of the world in the twentieth century was already subjected
to the direct control of European imperial powers, the United States did not
need to seize new colonies. It could just enlist preexisting European imperial
networks to realize its goals, outsourcing territorial control to its European
allies rather than seizing its own colonial territory.
Consider first the American state’s imperial imperatives in the postwar
period. One was expanded trade. Exceptionalist narratives and revisionist his-
torians alike point out that the United States inaugurated a global free trade
regime. For exceptionalists, this reveals how the American state was not impe-
rial. For revisionists it shows that it invented new imperial tactics. Yet both
sides run the risk of simplifying the complex activities of the United States in the
immediate aftermath of World War II and through the early 1960s. On the one
hand, in this period some politicians, sectors of the business community, and
policy makers spoke valiantly of free trade. Worried about the 1930s exclu-
sivism that had purportedly contributed to war, and concerned that wartime
levels of growth would not be sustained in peace, they looked abroad for new
markets and raw materials. 14 On the other hand, this was not intrinsically
an anticolonial or anti-imperial stance. To the contrary, as the business sec-
tor and policy makers repeatedly stressed, the best way for the United States
to get new markets and materials was not by dismantling the existing impe-
rial systems, but rather by sustaining them and tapping into them directly.
The colonial world was critical for supplying the ever-increasing demand for
various raw materials. 15 Analysts noted in 1941 that the “United States is
the greatest ultimate consumer of colonial products.” 16 In 1950, the State
Department produced memos stressing how important Africa was for provid-
ing raw materials and, in general, as a site for American “trade, investment, and
transportation interests.” 17 Various investigative commissions under the Tru-
man administration demonstrated how important minerals, metals, tin, rubber,
and other strategic materials were coming from colonies. 18 In 1952, another

analysis stressed, “existing and potential production in colonial territories are
vital to meeting these needs of Western industrial countries.” 19
The conclusion of these and other reports was that, to keep the supply
incoming and in hopes of finding markets for American products, the United
States should support European colonial structures rather than dismantle them.
European rule, stressed a State Department report in 1950, offered “political
and economic stability.” As long as American capital was afforded “equal
treatment,” America’s “economic goals . . . should be achieved through coor-
dination and cooperation with the colonial powers.” 20 The scholar Rupert
Emerson observed in 1947 that “American interest and interests, narrowly
interpreted, would be served more adequately by the maintenance of the old-
time colonial set-up than by ventures into the uncharted waters of autonomy
and independence,” not least because the “old-time colonial set up” rather
than a world of independent nation-states could better serve to meet America’s
need for raw materials and markets. 21 The State Department’s policy on French
rule in Africa followed: “Our primary objective in French West and Equatorial
Africa is to keep those territories under friendly and effective administration.
To this end we recognize the legitimacy and desirability of French political
control.” 22 In 1953, Undersecretary of State Byroade publicly announced that
U.S. policy had been and would continue to be oriented toward maintaining
European empires. He added how support of the European empires was tied
to America’s strategic interest in keeping Europe strong: “[T]he granting of
complete freedom to those who were not yet ready for it would serve the best
interests neither of the US nor the free world as a whole. . . . Let us be frank in
recognizing our stake in the strength and stability of certain European nations
which exercise influence in the dependent areas. They are our allies. A sudden
break in economic relations might seriously injure the European economy upon
which our Atlantic defence system depends, and at the same time prove equally
injurious to the dependent territories themselves.” 23
These were not idle words. By the time Byroade had made his speech, the
American state had already put its strategy of supporting the European empires
into action. It pushed the European empires to open their doors to North Amer-
ican interests and in exchange offered financial aid and support that would help
keep those empires intact. Such aid was sorely needed due to the devastation
of the war. Without funds, Europe’s empires would collapse. The American
state decided to provide them. 24 The Marshall Plan was a part of this strategy.
It was the economic aid package aimed at helping Europe recover from the

Patterns of Empire
devastation of the war, but it was not only aimed at Europe. Administered
through the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), it was also directed
at Europe’s colonial empires. In fact, a large chunk of the ECA’s work went to
supporting Europe’s colonies. Estimates by officials within the ECA reveal that
approximately $7.5 billion were targeted for Europe’s colonial empires in the
early 1950s, with the French and British colonial empires receiving approxi-
mately $6.5 billion, and the Portuguese, Belgian, and Dutch empires receiving
the rest. 25 In this way, Europe’s economies could be restored not in spite of
colonialism but through it. John Orchard, chairman of the ECA Advisory
Committee on Underdeveloped Areas, explained that the program would help
to reduce the “dollar gap” while also providing Europe with “increased sup-
plies of essential commodities” and “wider markets for European factories.”
At the same time, the United States would benefit. The United States would
gain access to the colonies, which would “supply additional raw materials for
our factories and foodstuffs to supplement our agricultural production” and
provide markets in the colonial world. It would further increase Europe’s own
purchasing power, enabling an economic recovery that would be open to new
products from across the Atlantic. 26 For these reasons and others, the State
Department conceded in 1950: “[T]he colonial relationship [between Europe
and its dependencies] . . . is still in many places useful and necessary.” 27
Postwar economics was only one dimension of the outsourced American
empire. The other was security and defense, a matter that was increasingly
foregrounded after 1947 as the Cold War intensified. One goal was to use allied
European empires as defensive bulwarks against Russia. As a State Department
memo in 1952 explained, the United States must “rely upon the colonial powers
of Western Europe to make an addition to American strength sufficient to deter
and to hold in check the tremendous military power of the Soviet armies.” 28
The United States therefore gave aid to the French military in Indochina and
the Dutch in Indonesia. 29 Supporting the French military effort in Indochina
(through aid that amounted to 80 percent of the French military costs by the
1950s) was aimed at stopping Vietnamese Communists from taking over the
country and strengthening Britain’s position in Malaysia against the spread of
Communism. 30 Likewise, to the mid-1950s, the United States relied on the long-
established British presence in key areas such as the Middle East as a bulwark
against Soviet expansion. 31 To stop dominos from falling, the American state
simply propped the European empires up against them. George Kennan of

the State Department’s Policy-Planning Staff later declared: “The dissolution
of the [British] empire was not in our interest as there were many things the
Commonwealth could do which we could not do and which we wished them
to continue doing.” 32 Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. told fellow Senators,
“we need . . . these countries to be strong, and they cannot be strong without
their colonies.” 33
Supporting Europe’s empires was also important for America’s own military-
base system. Prior to World War II, the United States had only a small network
of military bases, with bases only in its own colonies (e.g., the Philippines,
Hawaii, Puerto Rico). 34 By the end of the war, however, military strategists
had planned for an extensive worldwide network of security. The war had
already brought American forces to the far ends of the earth; how to keep them
there? Military advisors and policy planners in the executive branch landed on
an easy answer: Use the territorial domains already established by European
colonialism.
The strategy partly originated in 1941 when the United States lent Britain
war supplies in exchange for ninety-nine-year leases establishing military bases
in the Britain’s Caribbean colonies. After the war, the process continued, espe-
cially as the containment strategy emerged in the late 1940s. The United States
gave loans to Britain so that Britain could reestablish its overseas empire after
the war; in exchange, the United States was granted the use of any and all of
Britain’s overseas colonies for military bases or transport. 35 The United States
made similar arrangements with the French in North Africa. French colo-
nial control provided “stability, even though such stability is obtained largely
through repression” (in the words of the Bureau of Near Eastern, South Asian,
and African Affairs in the State Department). 36 This stability was deemed
important for halting future Soviet aggression and for allowing the American
state to maintain a military presence in the region. An agreement with France
in 1950, for instance, enabled the United States to construct five new air bases
in Morocco for Strategic Air Command. 37 Even though “imperial of the old
school is practiced” in North Africa, concluded the State Department, “there is
one favorable factor, that of US strategic interests, since we are in a position to
use this area in time of war.” 38 Similarly, the United States was allowed to set
up an air base in the Azores by Portugal, but only if it supported Portugal’s bid
to reassert itself over Timor (that airbase, at Lajes, would later stand as the vital
ground for U.S. airlift missions to Israel during the Yom Kippur War of 1973).
In the end, the United States was able to create its vast network of global
military power by relying on rather than dismantling European colonialism.

Patterns of Empire
Out of the top thirty-nine territories in Central America, the Caribbean, Africa,
Asia, and the Pacific wherein the United States maintained troops from 1950
to 1960 (measured in terms of number of troops), eight were U.S. colonies
(excluding Japan, which the United States temporarily ruled after World War
II), and twenty were colonies or protectorates of European countries (Table
4.2). Therefore, close to 70 percent of America’s troop outposts in the periph-
eral world were in colonies. 39 A secret memo in the State Department in 1950
stated: “[T]he security interests of the US at the present time will best be served
by a policy of support for the Western Colonial Powers.” 40
We now have one part of an answer for why the United States did not
take new territories in the mid-twentieth century: It did not need to. Because
it entered a global field that was already populated by empires with which
it could ally, all the American state had to do in order to meet its postwar
economic and security goals was support those empires and outsource imperial
functions to them. This was a not a privilege afforded the British empire a
century earlier. For one thing, the British empire could not easily outsource
imperial tasks to other empires. It did enlist the support of other empires when
and where it was possible. It supported the Ottoman empire to block Russian
expansion, maintain control over Mediterranean trade, and prevent an over-
land route to India from falling into enemy hands. 41 However, this approach
could only go so far. Whereas the United States faced a situation wherein its
allies controlled most of the world’s colonies, the British state faced a world in
which most of the major colonial empires were foes rather than friends. Russia
or France could sometimes be enlisted for support; but they were just as often
enemies.
It is also important that so much more of the world was uncolonized in the
nineteenth century. This meant that the British state could not meet its economic
goals without imperial expansion in the colonial mode. Like Americans in the
mid-twentieth century, British statesmen and capitalists in the nineteenth cen-
tury consistently looked for access to new raw materials and markets. Whereas
the Americans could meet this goal by relying on the sociopolitical and eco-
nomic structures created and sustained by European colonialism, the British
could not. Because so much of the world was uncolonized, there were no such
preexisting structures upon which to depend. To extract materials and find
new markets, the British state had to create those sociopolitical and economic
structures by itself, which meant the direct seizure and colonial control of ter-
ritory. Sir Charles Dilke reflected on British expansion in the mid-nineteenth

This counts countries that later received independence but were colonies when the United States
first established troop bases.

advisors, and missions to facilitate the improvement of Turkey’s administrative structure and
military. See Rodkey (1930), pp. 222–4.Imperial Forms, Global Fields

Patterns of Empire
century by saying that “large markets” and raw materials had to be found in
“almost all those territories in the globe which did not belong to the European
race.” 42 In other words, the British state tried to meet its imperial imperatives
by entering previously untapped regions – areas untouched and uncontrolled
by European empires. Exploiting these untapped regions of the world meant
annexing and then controlling them directly to make them manageable.
To be sure, for the British state, the conditions for economic extraction,
production, and trade would have been more difficult to secure without colo-
nial control. Colonialism was necessary for seizing land, protecting settlers and
planters, and articulating local labor systems to export production. It was also
necessary for maintaining security and order when these prerequisites could
not be secured by other means. 43 Thus many annexations began as enterpris-
ing merchants, landowners, and vanguard settlers pressed the home govern-
ment to annex the territory in order to create stable conditions and provide
protection in the frontier. Accordingly, much of the territorial expansion from
the mid-century onward occurred on the frontiers of already existing colonies,
such as around India, in Canada, or in Australia. 44 In other cases, annexation
was necessary to consolidate trade networks and expand them. Contiguous
areas around Bombay, in and near Australia, and in Malaya became increas-
ingly important to British trade by the late century, and fittingly Britain then
swallowed them up (e.g., outlying parts of India in 1815 and 1818; Western
Australia in 1832; New Zealand in 1841; and the Malaya/Straits Settlements in
1867). 45 The scramble for Africa later in the century followed the same logic:
Colonial control was necessary to secure the conditions for effective access
and trade. 46 As Joseph Chamberlain remarked in 1896, “We, in our colonial
policy, as fast as we acquire new territory and develop it, develop it . . . for the
commerce of the world.” 47 Relatedly, Hong Kong and Singapore were taken
because they could serve as trading ports and naval posts necessary for Britain’s
attempt to open up China to trade. Similarly, the Falkland Islands were seized
to consolidate Britain’s trade with Latin America.
These seizures were also related to the other imperial imperative: security
and defense. For much of the period after 1815, the British state pursued a
“blue water policy,” focusing much of its energy on home defense and keeping
on eye out on continental powers. At the same time, however, Britain’s military
was moving around the globe, both to help its expanding trade and to keep
rival European empires in check. In 1820, there were six overseas commands:
the Mediterranean, the southeast coast of America, North America and the
West Indies, the Cape of Good Hope, the west coast of Africa, and the East
Indies. As the decades proceeded, increasingly more command stations were set
up, not least in Australia and the Pacific, proportionate to the increase in duties

and activities that the navy faced. 48 Unlike the United States, Britain could
not rely on other empires for military access to these sites. The British state
had to take the territory itself to maintain safe basing stations. A handful of
exceptions aside, the British basing system was set up within Britain’s empire,
not outside it or in other empires. 49 Is it any wonder that whereas “the British
Empire took some two hundred years to reach its peak, the global security
system of the US [took] a mere ten years”? 50 The British had to annex frontier
territory around the world to establish its military bases, making for a slow and
piecemeal process of expansion. 51 The United States, by contrast, could rely
on the colonial domains already constructed by its predecessors to realize its
military dominance, thereby taking a much shorter span of time. If America’s
aversion to colonization after World War II was at all a virtue, it was a virtue
afforded by a luxury: the luxury of being a relative latecomer to empire.
The Subaltern Speaks Back
Understanding the political ecologies of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
helps us understand why the United States was reluctant to be imperialistic in
the territorial mode, whereas the British state was more willing. But this raises
more questions. Most important, why didn’t the United States colonize after
the 1960s? After all, while the United States relied on European empires to
realize its imperial goals from 1945 to the 1960s, some colonies had already
obtained independence by that time. Latin America had been independent for
a long time. Furthermore, by the mid-1960s, the European empires finally
crumbled. This meant that the United States could no longer rely on them,
and a host of new countries became independent. The United States could
have initiated an entirely new round of territorial imperialism. But it did not.
Instead it deployed informal tactics, thus surmounting the territorial constraints
of nineteenth-century imperialism.
Why? When the European empires finally broke down, why didn’t the Amer-
ican state step in directly to replace them? Addressing this question brings us
to the other dimension of the global field that we must consider: not politi-
cal ecology, but political culture; and not the political culture of the imperial
metropoles, but that of the colonized and postcolonized – the very people
imperialism sought to direct and manage.
“The Age of Imperialism is Ended”
On Memorial Day, 1942, Sumner Welles gave a renowned address at the
Arlington National Amphitheater. Welles was the U.S. Undersecretary of State
and one of President Roosevelt’s main foreign policy advisors. A year earlier,
he had appeared on the cover of Time magazine. Given his position, and given

Patterns of Empire
America’s entry into the war, British diplomats and others around the world
took notice of his address – as it turns out, rightfully so. His speech did nothing
short of calling for the end of empires. “If this war is in fact a war for the
liberation of peoples,” Welles declared, “it must assure the sovereign equality
of peoples throughout the world, as well as in the world of the Americas.
Our victory must bring in its train the liberation of all peoples. Discrimination
between peoples because of their race, creed or color must be abolished. The
age of imperialism is ended.” 52
Welles’s address is notable because it appears to express a classic exception-
alist theme. Presumably, Welles, President Roosevelt, Cordell Hull, and the rest
of U.S. officialdom planned to see a new world order emerge from the ashes of
World War II. Operating from America’s long-standing anticolonial and demo-
cratic tradition, they hoped to inaugurate a more liberal world that transcended
the tyrannical tendencies of Old World imperialism. This was to be a world
of independent nation-states rather than empires. Had not Welles played an
important part in establishing the United Nations? In this light, Welles’s speech
would appear both reflective and prescient: the former because the speech man-
ifested America’s traditions of liberty and freedom and anticolonial values; the
latter because, in the post–World War II period, the old empires were eventually
abolished, with the United Nations – and the benevolent American hegemon –
rising from their ashes.
We might already see the problems. For one, interpreting Welles’s speech as
prescient would occlude America’s own imperialism. It would blind us to the
fact that the United States took Japanese territories after the war as colonial
possessions; or that the United States, as just seen, restored and propped up
the European empires after World War II rather than dismantling them. For
another, interpreting Welles’s speech as reflective of American values would
overlook the fact that, although Welles himself made grand anti-imperial pro-
nouncements, he often reiterated age-old colonial maxims about colonized
peoples’ lack of capacity and their need for continued imperial control. A year
after his Memorial Day address, he conjured that discourse to justify con-
tinued imperial intervention: “We all of us recognize that it will take many
generations for some backward peoples to be prepared for autonomy and self-
government.” 53 In fact, Welles’s grandiose speech – declaring that the “age
of imperialism is ended” and asserting that the war should be fought for the
“liberation” of all peoples – was pragmatically motivated. Penned in 1942,
Welles had specific things in mind. Along with America’s allies, he hoped to
enlist colonized peoples in the fight against Germany. He pretended to be the
champion of the anti-imperial cause in order to win nationalists in the colonial
world over to the Allied side. 54

Welles’s speech should not be taken as reflective of anti-imperial American
values; nor should it be read as heralding a new world order inaugurated by
America’s valiant agency. A different reading would see it rather as reflective
of a global shift, a wider international wave of change that Welles and other
officials chased and rode, rather than one they engendered by their own agency.
In a later speech, Welles alluded to that global tide more precisely. “New and
powerful nationalistic forces are breaking into life throughout the earth, and
in particular in the vast regions of Africa, of the Near East, and of the Far
East. Must not these forces, unless they are to be permitted to start new and
devastating inundations, be canalized through the channels of liberty into the
great stream of constructive and cooperative human endeavour?” 55 In other
words, Welles’s statement, “the age of imperialism is ended,” does not so
much reflect deep American values as it reflects transformations occurring
in the wider global field. Those transformations made for a very different
global field than that faced by Britain in the nineteenth century. I speak of the
emergence, proliferation, and ultimate dominance of anticolonial nationalism
in the colonized and later postcolonial world.
Nationalism Redounded
It is by now well known that anticolonial nationalism spread around the globe
during the twentieth century. Revolts in the Americas in previous centuries –
including the American revolt against Britain, the Haitian rebellion against
France, and the Latin American republics against Spain – had established the
precedent. However, what was new in the twentieth century was the emergence
of anticolonial nationalism across the globe rather than in just one region,
and among predominantly nonwhite colonized populations rather than white-
settler or Creole populations in the Americas. Traditional histories locate its
origins in the espousals of self-determination by President Woodrow Wilson
and his Fourteen Points during World War I. Yet in fact, as other scholar-
ship emphasizes, anticolonial nationalism and espousals of self-determination
had emerged long before Wilson’s speech (which is exactly why his discourse
resonated among colonized peoples beyond Wilson’s intentions). 56 The fact
that European colonialism had taken over nearly all of the peripheral world
by this time was itself a factor that helped to propel anticolonial nationalism.
European colonialism had offered education and political experience to colo-
nized elites while also generating discontent and redefining local identities into
nationalized spatial boundaries. 57
The earliest stirrings of anticolonial nationalism in the nonwhite world were
already seen in the Indian National Congress (1885), the Islamic revival move-
ments in the Middle East (beginning in the late nineteenth century), the Philip-
pine Revolution against Spain (1896), and the Pan-African Congress in 1900.

Patterns of Empire
The Japanese victory over Russia (1905) and the Xinhai Revolution in China
(1911) added fuel to the fire, signifying to the colonial world that nonwhite
peoples could determine their own destinies. 58 Seizing on this global devel-
opment, V. I. Lenin joined the chorus, articulating anti-imperial rhetoric and
calling for self-determination of all peoples. 59 It was Lenin’s discourse that
compelled Woodrow Wilson to add pronouncements on self-determination in
his Fourteen Points. Rather than being the originator of anticolonial national-
ism, Wilson was just trying to keep up. 60
The period between the world wars was a turning point. President Wilson
had received pleas for help from anticolonial nationalists around the world
but, as he did nothing to help, disappointment spread. Imperial boundaries
existing before World War I were reinscribed at the postwar Treaty of Paris,
much to the further disappointment of anticolonial nationalists who held out
hope that they would be dismantled. During the 1920s, as Ghandi’s populism
spread through India, his anticolonial stance received widespread attention
from the newly educated colonial elites around the imperial world. 61 At the
Fifth Pan-American Conference at Santiago, Chile, in 1923, Latin Americans
joined the chorus, charging the United States with imperialism for intervening
in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. 62 The 1930s Depression then laid the
socioeconomic conditions for protests across Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean.
World War II helped hasten the trend. It weakened colonial structures, armed
colonized peoples, and raised questions about the strength of European empires
and their future viability. 63 After the war, anticolonial nationalism continued
to spread. In 1951, the General Assembly of the United Nations voted for a
review of the UN system of territorial administration of mandates and for a
statement to be inserted into Covenants that “all peoples shall have the right
of self-determination” (the U.S. delegate voted against this). 64 The Bandung
Conference in 1955 solidified these anticolonial sentiments while offering a
powerful rallying point for an seemingly unstoppable nationalism around the
world. 65
The emergence and proliferation of anticolonialism significantly altered the
global landscape, making for a new terrain of action. Foremost, it became a
powerful mobilizing device, making possible new coalitions and political for-
mations. As a symbol, anticolonial nationalism and its principle of universal
self-determination mobilized disparate groups within and across imperial space.
Tribes or religious sectarians could unite on national grounds whereas they

may not have before, and colonized peoples from different countries could find
common cause. After Italy attacked Ethiopia in October of 1935, for instance,
protests erupted as far away as British Guiana, and activists in Harlem, NY,
held mass meetings to enlist soldier volunteers. W. E. B. DuBois declared it to
be a “cost in debt and death” for “the whole colored world – India, China and
Japan, Africa in Africa and in America, and all the South Seas and Indian South
America.” 66 This reaction manifests the larger trend. Empires were increas-
ingly seen as illegitimate, nation-states were becoming the ideal, and anticolo-
nial nationalism could now become a tool for mobilization. As the historian
Koebner observed in 1964: “The political word [imperialism] . . . had by 1940
become the rallying cry of an opposition outside the English-speaking part of
the world.” 67 In 1952, the Foreign Office prepared a memorandum on “The
Problem of Nationalism” that circulated in Winston Churchill’s cabinet. The
memo warned of the “dangers inherent in the present upsurge of nationalism”
around the imperial world and cautioned against the “intersections” of “Asian
nationalism” and nationalism in “the Near East and Africa.” 68 Anticolonial
nationalism became a global force to reckon.
As anticolonial nationalism diffused across the global field, and as the prin-
ciple of national self-determination became a potent tool by which to accrue
political support, the terrain of geopolitical competition likewise shifted. The
USSR, for instance, tried to use it as symbolic capital. This had begun during
the First World War with Lenin’s anti-imperial rhetoric, prompting Wilson, as
mentioned earlier, to declare support for self-determination. But as anticolo-
nialists mobilized further during and after World War II, and as the Cold War
heightened between 1947 and 1951, officials in Washington became increas-
ingly worried that the Soviet Union would penetrate anticolonial nationalist
movements and use the new powerful discourse for their own ends. A 1950
policy paper from the Bureau of Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs
assessed the situation in Africa:
While Communism has made very little headway in most of Africa, European nations
and the United States have become alert to the danger of militant Communism pene-
trating the area. The USSR has sought within the United Nations and outside to play
the role of the champion of the colonial peoples of the world. While the greater portion
of the areas of Africa have as yet no firm nationalist aspirations, there are certain areas
such as French North Africa and British West Africa where the spirit of nationalism is
increasing. The USSR has sought to gain the sympathy of nationalist elements. 69
The diffusion of anticolonial nationalism is also significant because it
redounded back to Europe and the United States to impact imperial thought. As
colonized groups mobilized against empire, so too did anti-imperialist thought
galvanize in Britain. The overwhelming tide of anticolonial nationalism likely

contributed to the Labor Party’s anti-imperial stance and also to various colo-
nial reforms in British territories designed to appease anticolonial sentiment. 70
In 1942, an editorial in The Times of London referred to the fall of Singapore to
Japan to suggest that Britain should reconsider its imperial order and seek “new
policies and a new outlook.” In the future, “there is no place for the Britain
of the past.” An American executive policy committee on Africa commented
on this editorial to conclude: “[W]hite people as represented in Great Britain
should give up any thought of trying to control the world in the way often
characteristic in the past.” 71 In 1946, the former director of the Department of
the Interior’s Division of Territories and Island Possessions noted simply that
the “time has passed when the peoples of the Indies, Indo-China, Burma and
India would permit white men to dictate the tenor of their lives.” 72
The force of anticolonial nationalism ultimately prompted a search for new
tactics to maintain some kind of imperial control in the face of the rising tide.
The idea of international mandates or “trusteeships” was one such tactic. Orig-
inally proposed to President Wilson by Jan Smuts of South Africa, and later
to President Franklin Roosevelt by Chiang Kai Shek, the trusteeship idea was
a strategic response to anticolonial sentiment. The State Department noted
that “the use of trusteeship . . . frequently avoids the controversial issue of the
extension of sovereignty over the area by any State.” 73 Accordingly, officials
in Washington and London saw international mandates or trusteeships as one
way to appear nonimperial while nonetheless exerting territorial control. 74
President Franklin Roosevelt had warmed to the idea of trusteeships after reck-
oning the power of anticolonial mobilization. In his discussions with advisors
and representatives from Russia in 1942 about the postwar order, President
Roosevelt argued that trusteeships would be preferable because there had been
“a palpable surge toward independence” in Southeast Asian colonies, “and
the white nations thus could not hope to hold these areas as colonies in the
long run.” 75 The 1952 Foreign Office memo on the problem of nationalism
put it simply: “Progress towards sovereign independence is both inevitable and
desirable. We are bound to swim with the stream but we can hope to exert
influence on the speed at which the current runs.” 76
In this sense, when Sumner Welles, Franklin Roosevelt, and other American
statesmen or officials portended the end of the age of imperialism in the 1940s,

Louis (1978), pp. 99–103; Howe (1993). Rather than upset Middle Eastern nationalists by
taking Iraq directly as a colony in 1922, for example, Britain created a kingdom for the benefit
of Faisal, son of Hussein. This gave Britain the appearance of being liberal while nonetheless
maintaining some amount of control over Iraq.

they were simply observing the transformations around them, responding to the
agency of colonized peoples rather than authoring or initiating it. The change
in views of William Phillips, America’s advisor to India, is one case in point. He
was at first a supporter of empires but later urged President Franklin Roosevelt
to support the Indian National Congress and its demands for a timeline toward
independence. What changed his mind was his experience in India. After he
witnessed Gandhi’s fast in 1943 and the overwhelming support it received, he
warned President Roosevelt: “Color consciousness is also appearing [in India]
and more and more under present conditions is bound to develop. We have,
therefore, a vast bloc of Oriental peoples who have many things in common,
including a dislike and distrust of the Occidental.” 77 Wallace Murray in the
State Department suggested likewise that the United States should consider
supporting Indian independence because if it did not, “we can expect a harvest
of hate and contempt the like of which our imperialistically minded ally has
never known.” 78 As for President Roosevelt himself, he worried about the con-
tinuation of empires not just because of his political values, but also because
he was a pragmatist. Given the strength of anticolonial nationalism around the
world, anyone who supported empires would only make enemies. Roosevelt’s
support for the international mandate or trustee system followed. So too did
his general support of the idea that, one day, colonized peoples would have
to be freed. Charles Taussig, Roosevelt’s confidant and advisor, noted about
his conversations with Roosevelt about colonies that the president “was con-
cerned about the brown people in the East. He [Roosevelt] said that there are
1,100,000,000 brown people. In many Eastern countries, they are ruled by a
handful of whites and they resent it. . . . 1,100,000,000 potential enemies are
dangerous.” 79
Shifting Strategies
The proliferation of anticolonial nationalism is vital for our story: It helps
us understand why the American state shifted its tactics away from formal
imperialism. As a response to the power of anticolonial sentiment and the new
geopolitical terrain, the American state first reconsidered its initial strategy of
imperial outsourcing. The United States supported European empires to help
realize its imperial goals, but the unmistakable power of anticolonial national-
ism complicated the strategy. For example, when and where American policy
makers perceived anticolonial nationalism to be relatively weak or nascent, the
United States was more willing to continue to prop up European colonialism. 80
In most of Africa in the early 1950s, the United States continued to support the
European empires because nationalism was perceived to be weaker there, and

Patterns of Empire
the efforts of the USSR to “win” over nationalists had been “unsuccessful.” 81
The United States only stopped its support as nationalism and the threat of
Communism developed more strongly in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Sec-
retary of State John Foster Dulles insisted that the United States should aid
nationalist forces in Africa rather than suppress them because America’s “pres-
tige” was at stake. 82 The State Department had summarized this policy in its
policy paper on dependent areas: “In most dependent areas of the world the
security interests of the US at the present time will best be served by a policy of
support for the Western Colonial Powers. [But where nationalist movements]
have so effectively challenged European administration . . . it is in the interest
of the US to accept the situation as it is and to encourage the progressive
and peaceful transfer of administration from the imperial power to the local
inhabitants.” 83
This was part of the larger pattern: When and where Washington perceived
nationalism to be comparably developed, it lightened its support of European
colonialism. This approach was most clearly articulated in a series of pol-
icy papers circulating in the State Department. The shared assessment was
that continued support of European powers would be fruitless in the end, for
anticolonial nationalist movements would effectively destabilize colonialism. 84
The related assessment was that continued support would damage America’s
“reputation” and push nationalist forces to the USSR. Of particular concern
was Soviet “propaganda” in the colonial world that portrayed the United States
as imperialist. Such propaganda, playing on anticolonial sentiment, would turn
anticolonial nationalists into anti-American allies of the Soviet Union. Strate-
gists in Washington therefore insisted that the United States would have to
disavow its alliance with the European empires if it was to win hearts and
minds and prevent a global turn toward Communism. 85
These fears are clear in the Eisenhower administration’s response to the
Suez crisis in 1956. The administration condemned the Anglo-French invasion
against General Nasser in Egypt exactly because it feared that the invasion
would summon a nationalist and Communist blowback throughout the region
and across the colonial world. 86 The fears are also evident in relation to areas
like India and Malaysia, where anticolonialism had developed relatively early.
In such areas, the United States encouraged European powers to make concrete
and well-publicized steps toward self-government to try to stem the tide against
would-be Communists. Similarly, the Kennedy administration pressured Por-
tugal to decolonize its African colonies in the hopes that this would take some
of the fire away from the Communist movement (even though the United States

would reverse its position as the American base in the Azores became more and
more important to U.S. interests). 87 The United States also stopped support-
ing French suppression of colonial nationalists in Vietnam and Dutch rule in
Indonesia, but only when anticolonial forces had proven far too resistant to
repression and when anticolonial movement waved anti-Soviet banners. 88 One
State Department official summarized the strategy for Vietnam simply enough.
Suggesting that the United States stop its support of French rule given the out-
pouring of anticolonial sentiment, he asked rhetorically: “Whether the French
like it or not, independence is coming to Indochina. Why, therefore, do we tie
ourselves to the tail of their battered kite?” 89
Whereas the proliferation and power of anticolonial nationalism compelled
the United States to diminish its support of the European empires, it likewise
compelled the United States to turn away from colonialism altogether. If the
United States worried about how its support of European empires would be
perceived, it followed that the United States would not initiate a new round of
territorial rule over postcolonial areas. After all, a new round of colonization
would arouse nationalist resistance and significantly raise the costs of occupa-
tion. As Secretary of State John Foster Dulles noted in 1953, the peoples of
the Near East and South Asia are “suspicious of the colonial powers,” and
so “the day is past when [nationalist] aspirations can be ignored.” President
Eisenhower told Winston Churchill in 1954 that “should we try to dam up
[nationalism in the Middle East] completely, it would, like a mighty river, burst
through the barriers and could create havoc.” 90 A National Security Council
report stated it boldly. Noting the staggering development of nationalist con-
sciousness in Southeast Asia, the Council concluded simply: “19th century
imperialism is no longer a practicable system in SEA [Southeast Asia].” 91
Recolonization would also have other serious consequences: Foremost, it
would arouse the indignation of postcolonial countries and nationalist move-
ments around the world, pushing all of them toward the USSR. The United
States would lose the Cold War even if it gained new colonies. As the National
Security Council stated in a secret memo, “The peoples of the colonial states
would never agree to fight Communism unless they were assured of their
freedom.” 92 In other words, to win hearts and minds and thereby win the
Cold War, the United States had to support national independence around the
world rather than squash it by recolonization. This strategy was clearly stated
in a famous 1952 State Department paper identifying the “General Objectives
of US Policy Toward Colonial Areas.” It stated that America’s main objective

was to “favour the progressive development of all dependent peoples toward
the goal of self-government.” The reason was described as follows:
[S]ubstantial advocates toward self-government have been made in a number of ter-
ritories and more than 500 million people have achieved independence. Nationalist
movements are gaining strength in non-self-governing territories throughout the world.
US policy must be based on the general assumption that nationalism in colonial areas
is a force which cannot be stopped but may, with wisdom, be guided. . . . It is clearly
in the interest of the US to give appropriate encouragement to those movements which
are non-communist and democratic in character. [This would] contribute toward the
building of colonial areas into bulwarks against the spread of communism. The very
fact of a demonstrated US interest in democratic nationalist movements will strengthen
the hand of these groups against their communist counterparts. 93
U.S. policy, therefore, should “seek the alignment with the democratic world
of dependent peoples and those achieving self-government or independence; in
particular to maintain and strengthen their friendship and respect for the US.
The importance of this objective is clear in view of the Soviet Union’s obvious
bid for the sympathies of colonial peoples.” 94 The paper enhanced its views by
quoting the Philippine Representative to the United Nations: “[T]he true goal
of all dependent peoples is freedom and not enslavement by a new master.” 95
In short, given the changed field, supporting the independence of weaker
nations rather than colonizing them was a way to win political support from
anticolonial nationalists and contain rival imperial power, in this case, the
Soviet Union. This was feasible given the fact that global opinion had turned
away from empire as a legitimate form of political power. The scholar Rupert
Emerson’s observations in 1947 were prescient here. He pointed to the new
global “climate of opinion” against colonialism and pondered:
Should the US turn its policy in the direction of support for these [colonial] peoples?
The answer should be clearly and unequivocally in the affirmative. The major reason for
such an answer is that it . . . will tend to align the US with the forces of the future rather
than of the past. . . . There are new worlds in the making. . . . The Near East, China, and
India are all moving forward in new directions, and the hold which the US has had on
the imaginations of the hundreds of millions of peoples of these areas can be maintained
only if the US makes it unmistakably clear that it is with them and not against them. 96
In 1955, John Foster Dulles’s statement on U.S. policy in Africa echoed
Emerson’s point. Dulles noted a rise in “African consciousness” and a “young
nationalism” similar to the “nationalism of the Middle East and South Asia.”
As a result, the USSR had been trying to identify itself in the region “with ‘the
oppressed colonial peoples of the world.’” Accordingly, U.S. policy should aim
to “consolidate its cultural and moral position with respect to the Africans.” 97

A subsequent memo by the consul general at Leopoldville added some clarity
on what this should involve: “Now that the issue of ‘colonialism’ is being
moved front and center by the Soviets the essential thing it seems to me is that
we free ourselves from the vice. . . . The US should stand for freedom from all
forms of oppression, for self-government, and for independence based upon
self-determination.” He concluded that financial aid should be given to the
continent directly, rather than through the European colonial powers, and
thereby “maneuver . . . by abolishing the vestiges of the ‘older’ imperialism.” 98
Subsequent memos and policy statements reiterated the very same views. 99
Finally, the new global climate of anticolonial nationalism and its use as
symbolic capital by geopolitical rivals did not only compel the American state to
turn away from colonialism. It also prompted the American state to shift from
colonialism to informal imperialism by the same token. Informal imperialism
enabled the American state to exert controls without declaring sovereignty over
foreign territory. As such, it was useful for exercising power without as much
risk of provoking anticolonial nationalists. Informal imperialism enabled the
United States to appear respectful of postcolonial sovereignty while nonetheless
permitting it to “pull the strings whenever necessary” (as one State Department
official put it in talks with the British on strategy in Asia). 100 But how exactly
did this shift occur?
To see it more clearly, we can briefly consider a case when the American
state might have reestablished some form of direct colonial control over post-
colonial countries but did not: Iran in the late 1940s and early 1950s. This
is an especially informative case because Iran was an area of vital strategic
interest to the Western powers. By the end of the Second World War, both the
United States and the United Kingdom had become increasingly dependent on
oil from the region and from Iran itself. Exactly because of this, Washington
often worried about Soviet activities. In 1946, the United States had persuaded
Soviet troops to leave the northern provinces, but the Soviet threat did not
go away so easily. In 1947, the precursor agency to the Central Intelligence
Agency warned that the USSR would not give up until it took all of Iran. 101
Given its importance, American policy makers declared that whatever policy
they enacted in regard to Iran might serve as a “model” and “test case” for
dealing with strategically important territories in the new postwar order. 102
But how to maintain influence and thwart Soviet incursion? The possibility
of establishing a new type of direct territorial control was in fact entertained
early on. President Roosevelt and military strategists considered establishing

an international trusteeship over Iranian railways and the Iranian port on the
Persian Gulf. This would give the United States and its allies more direct con-
trol over critical functions relating to oil concessions in Iran while also serving
economic and geopolitical goals. Not only would it “assist Iran economically,”
as the State Department report on the issue announced, it would also entice
Russia to take part in the trusteeship as a partner. By providing the Soviets with
a direct hand in territorial management, it would discourage “more forceful
methods by Russia to gain an outlet to the Gulf” and thereby “develop inter-
national cooperation rather than rivalry in Iran.” 103 Despite these potential
rewards, however, the American state ultimately disavowed the strategy. The
reason was simple: the threat of a nationalist uprising.
This threat had already been posed earlier. When Britain tried to estab-
lish Iran as a protectorate after World War I (by imposing the Anglo-Persian
Agreement of 1919), it faced strong nationalist resistance. The Iranian Prime
Minister Seyyid Zia-ud-din, in a declaration in 1921, loudly denounced it. The
same threat faced the American state as it considered establishing a trusteeship
to be operated by joint nations. “No matter how drawn up or proposed,” read
the State Department’s summary for why a trusteeship was not feasible, “the
plan would appear to Iran, and doubtless to the world, as a thinly disguised
cover for power politics and old-world imperialism. Iranians are highly sus-
picious of foreign influence in the country and would unquestionably resent
any extension of foreign control there. . . . The Department’s judgment is that
the trusteeship could only be imposed on Iran, a sovereign, allied nation, by
force of arms.” 104 The potency of anticolonial nationalism substantially raised
the costs of an international trusteeship. The cost of direct colonial rule would
have been even higher.
The problem remained: How would the United States maintain stability in
the region, protect oil concessions, and ward off rival incursion if not by estab-
lishing territorial control? The answer was to use informal mechanisms. The
United States would send financial aid, technicians, and advisors for helping
to manage the port and the railways connected to the oil concessions. Presum-
ably, this would exert U.S. influence in a manner more palatable to nationalists.
Iran would retain official sovereignty, but the United States would be able to
influence the control of its vital assets. As the “Iranians prefer to employ Amer-
icans or the nationals of small European countries (Sweden or Switzerland),”
there was little threat of Soviets wielding undue influence. Therefore, by these
informal mechanisms, the “laudable ends” in the proposal for international
trusteeship could still be “accomplished in some measure.” 105
Even this type of indirect influence was not enough, though. More prob-
lems arose later, in 1951, when the Iranian premier Mohammed Musaddiq
nationalized Iranian oil fields. Faced with this problem, the United States again

considered direct intervention – this time beginning with a military invasion.
However, that option had already been disavowed on the grounds that it would
“provoke a communist rising with Soviet backing in northern Iran” and turn
Iran into “another Korea.” 106 The American state needed, as President Eisen-
hower told his advisors and the British foreign secretary in a secret meeting
on the issue, “to find some new and imaginative approach to the Persian oil
problem which kept Persia in the Western orbit.” The preferred solution was to
act covertly so as to hide American influence. Accordingly, the recently formed
CIA (1947) orchestrated the overthrow of Mussadiq and the restoration of
the Shah with the army of General Fazlollah Zahedi. 107 “Prompt and sub-
stantial economic aid,” as CIA classified reports called it, was to be used to
maintain the Shah’s loyalty. 108 American companies thereafter got their hands
on more oil concessions. For the American state, the subsequent stability and
anti-Communist stance of the Shah’s regime were a related boon. Winston
Churchill conveyed to Washington that the new situation promised to “change
the whole picture in the Middle East.” 109
The overthrow of Mussadiq was the first postwar instance of America’s use
of covert force to topple a foreign regime, besides perhaps in Latin America. It
was surely not the last. We come to another telling instance when the United
States might have directly colonized foreign territory but did not: the Philip-
pines in the 1950s. The United States had granted the islands independence in
1946, but the postcolonial regime faced serious problems by the 1950s. The
peasant-based guerilla Communist movement, known as the Huks, had been
gaining ground. Philippine President Quirino’s regime, in the eyes of the intel-
ligence establishment in Washington, was unwittingly fanning their flames by
its blatant corruption. This was a serious problem for America’s geopolitical
strategy. The Philippines remained an important nodal point in America’s net-
work of defense, and large U.S. military bases were maintained there. The fear
was that, unless Quirino’s regime cleaned up or was cast out, the Communists
would continue to gain ground and ultimately push the archipelago to the
USSR.
To deal with this issue, there was the possibility of a U.S. military occu-
pation to suppress the Communist movement. As a policy information officer
explained to Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Dean Rusk,
this would mean that “the American army will be fighting a Philippine guerilla
army, which . . . will have the support of the Nationalists,” and thus “the pro-
cess of recolonializing [sic] the Philippines will then be well advanced.” 110 Yet
given the power of anticolonial nationalism, no such “recolonializing” was

to occur. The problem would be that such direct intervention would invoke
the ire of nationalists and push the Philippines even further to Communism.
The Communists would then “have the support of the Nationalists just as
Ho’s regime [in Indochina] has had.” 111 The policy information office for the
Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs put it simply: Although the “process of recolo-
nializing” would be “well advanced,” given anticolonial nationalism and the
threat of Soviet manipulation of it, “we shall not get away with it.” 112 The
State Department’s Livingston Merchant had earlier worried about this very
situation, offering the same conclusion. In 1950, in the wake of the loss of
China to Communists, he wrote a memo to Assistant Secretary of State Dean
Rusk in which he warned that “the dilemma the United States Government
now faces is how to force an ineffectual local government to do internally what
it must do, without reoccupying the country.” Why not reoccupy the country?
Because it would “cause violent repercussions throughout Asia and Western
Europe as well.” 113 It would, in other words, evoke an outcry from anticolo-
nial nationalists who would rightfully turn instead to the USSR. As with Iran,
then, the preferred solution to colonial occupation was to use covert tactics and
informal mechanisms. Rather than initiating a new round of colonization that
would diminish America’s symbolic capital and push the Philippines toward
Communism, CIA operators manipulated the Philippine elections to ensure the
victory of Ramon Magsaysay over Quirino. The United States then established
Magsaysay as America’s preferred client in exchange for an influx of aid. 114
From the Japanese Mandates to Fiji: A Comparison
As direct colonial rule was no longer an option given the proliferation of anti-
colonial nationalism, the American state was limited to employing informal
means to exert influence and needed to construct a new network of clients
and collaborators rather than just colonies. If this were true, it would follow
the American state would have employed formal imperialism when or where
anticolonial nationalism had not taken root and where, therefore, the threat
of resistance based on anticolonial principles was minimal. It is difficult to
test this proposition properly because, as seen, anticolonial nationalism had
become a global phenomenon in the mid-twentieth century. There were few
if any areas where nationalist consciousness had not developed to levels per-
ceived as dangerous by would-be American imperialists. However, a look at
the Japanese-mandated territories in the Pacific after World War II is telling.
As seen in an earlier chapter, the United States took control over the former
Japanese territories in 1947, under the guise of the mandate system. As strategic
“Trust Territories,” these islands became the one area where the United States

did not in fact employ informal imperialism and instead resorted to old-
fashioned colonialism. This stands as an exception to our story: the only
case where the United States established direct control over foreign territory
after World War II. So why was the American state willing to do this for the
Japanese territories but not for other parts of the peripheral world? Was it not
concerned about anticolonial resistance to direct territorial control or Soviet
manipulation of it? There was some concern in Washington about the public
image of the United States if it were to take the islands as colonies. President
Roosevelt’s 1943 investigative commission into the question of taking the
Pacific territories worried that taking them as colonies would put the United
States at risk for being “charged with imperialism” and “aggrandizement.” 115
Still, despite these worries, the United States proceeded to take the islands as
Trust Territories.
There were two reasons. The first is that the Cold War had not yet taken
off, so there was little threat of Soviet anticolonial propaganda. Indeed, the
United States established control in consultation with the Soviets. The second
reason is that the threat of nationalist resistance was minimal. As officials
in the military establishment and the Committee on Dependent Areas saw
things, the islands were small and distant and the population apparently too
sparse to pose trouble. Henry L. Stimson, the U.S. secretary of war who had
previously served in the Philippines, was among those who pushed Washington
to seize the Japanese territories. He explained to Roosevelt that acquiring
the islands was feasible because the situation was different from the time of
World War I. There was “no population to be imperialized.” 116 There was
a population of 103,000 persons, excluding Japanese residents, but as one
admiral put it, that was “pretty small potatoes.” 117 In other words, a new
round of colonization was only feasible where anticolonial resistance did not
exist. A National Security Council report was clear on this point. On discussing
policy toward Southeast Asia, it clarified that “19th century imperialism” is
only “a practicable system . . . where the subject people are unsophisticated
and acquiescent, as in the case of certain South Pacific islanders.” 118 This was
written in 1949, just as the American state was establishing its power over the
“small potatoes” in the Japanese territories, where evidently the people were
“acquiescent.”
It should follow that the relative weakness of anticolonial nationalism in
the nineteenth century explains why direct colonialism as opposed to informal
imperialism was sometimes initiated by the British state. Let us consider this
more deeply by going back to 1860, close to a century before the National Secu-
rity Council issued its report on the feasibility of imperialism in the world. In
1860, Her Majesty’s secretary of foreign affairs and other men in Lord Derby’s

government contemplated the possibility of extending British sovereignty over
the islands of Fiji. British settlers and merchants had already been operating
in the islands; a local chief Thakombau of Bau had made an offer of cession to
the British Crown; and the British consul William Thomas Pritchard was press-
ing London to accept. Investigations were conducted, documents and reports
passed hands, and memos were exchanged. Ultimately, however, the offer was
refused. Britsh sovereignty over Fiji was not to be. Why not?
The reasons given by contemporaries for the refusal to take Fiji were numer-
ous. However, among them was the threat of native resistance. Months earlier,
war had erupted in New Zealand. Maoris resisted the usurpation of their land
by white settlers and the British Army had responded with gunfire. Such was the
context in which British officials considered Fiji. Indeed, the violence directly
impacted the recommendation by the governor of New South Wales, who
warned the Colonial Office that the “inevitable result” of taking Fiji and the
subsequent arrival of whites “will be a war of races.” The “cost of an attempt
to maintain the supremacy of the white population,” he predicted, “will be
comparatively great and the loss of life enormous.” 119 The Colonial Office, the
Foreign Office, and the undersecretary of state agreed. Sir Frederic Rodgers,
the new permanent undersecretary in the Colonial Office, summed it up: “The
present juncture certainly is not one in which it would be convenient to become
responsible for the Government of more warlike savages than we already have
on our hands.” 120
The decision not to colonize Fiji due to this fear of resistance would seem
similar to the American state’s reluctance to colonize new territory in the
mid- to late twentieth century. 121 But similarities stop here. Although London
surely worried about a possible “war of races,” this was not the only reason for
turning Fiji down. There were other reasons, not least Fiji’s lack of value at the
time. Lord Carnarvon put it simply: “[W]e gain nothing by the acquisition.” 122
The other difference is that, unlike the American state later, the British state
eventually came around. In 1874, when the next opportunity to annex Fiji
arose, British officials decided to take it. The reasons for the turn are multiple.
We will explore them in a later chapter. For now we take note that the reason
cited previously for not seizing Fiji – native resistance – was irrelevant this time
around. Lord Carnarvon, who had previously stood against annexation, now
declared that annexation was imperative rather than a burden. “England has

Quoted in Eldridge (1967), p. 177.
To be sure, there is a parallel. Just as the American state was willing to colonize Japanese
territories because local resistance would be “small potatoes” given the small number of
inhabitants, so too did the Colonial Office, in considering Fiji, decide that the only Pacific
territory that might be annexed was the island of Oparo (Rapa) on the grounds that it had
“few inhabitants” [quoted in Drus (1950), p. 90].

161
a mission,” he asserted to Parliament, “to extend her policy of annexation in
this part of the world.” 123
The fact that British officials worried about native resistance in 1860 but
found it less worrisome in 1874 is indicative. In the nineteenth century, resis-
tance to colonial rule was indeed threatening, but it was sporadic and inconsis-
tent. This is exactly because anticolonial nationalism had not yet proliferated
around the globe to mobilize populations against empires. In fact, prior to the
time when the Crown took Fiji, in 1874, resistance to colonialism had been
irregular. Available data reveals that, from 1816 to 1868 (after which Britain
finally annexed Fiji), local populations had posed armed resistance to Euro-
pean conquests in about 24 percent of all cases (twenty-one conquests out of
eighty-nine total). Compare this with what happened later, when nationalist
consciousness began to spread. From 1868 to 1918, local populations posed
resistance in 73 percent of all cases of conquest (fifty-eight out of eighty total
conquests), a far greater percentage than the mere 24 percent earlier in the
century. 124 The wars of resistance that would unsettle the halls of imperial
power occurred mostly at that time. Cuba and the Philippines erupted against
Spain in the 1890s. The Boer War posed unforeseen trouble for the Crown in
1899. The Sierra Leone Hut Tax War probably reflected, in the words of Gov-
ernor Frederic Cardew, “the growing political consciousness of the African,”
but that was in 1898. 125 All of these events and others marked a shift toward
a new global field in which anticolonial nationalism dominated. Before then,
resistance to colonialism had neither the form, fire, nor fever that anticolonial
nationalism would later inject.
Given this, it is unsurprising that British officials did not let threats of resis-
tance undermine their decision to take Fiji in the 1870s. They may have worried
about bouts of native recalcitrance here and there, but the relative weakness of
nationalist consciousness in Fiji meant that they did not fret about sustained or
infectious resistance threatening to overthrow colonial rule. In Fiji as in many
other places coveted by the British imperial state, native resistance was most
often localized along ethnic, tribal, or other lines. It did not have the mobiliz-
ing capacity of nationalism. As Johnson puts it, resistance was considered to
be “tribal and sporadic.” When there were the stirrings of nationalist move-
ments, British officials saw them as “small, unrepresentative minorities.” 126
Lord Carnarvon’s views on Fiji in the 1870s express this wider perception
exactly. “The Natives are scattered over 200 Islands,” he explained, “they are
divided in local jealousies; and with the exception of the 20,000 mountaineers,
they are a milder and gentler class of Natives than those in New Zealand.” 127

that was not disabling. In response to an outbreak of violence in 1860 there, an
editorial in the London Times concluded that there was little to worry over. The
Maori resistance would be suppressed soon enough, it declared; “before much
mischief has ensued.” The editorial then referred to rumors that some among
the Maori were showing nascent signs of a “nationality” and were considering
“coalescing under a native sovereign to arrest the progress of the Europeans.”
Yet again there was nothing to worry about. The movement was “by no means
universal.” Most of the population had “discernment enough to . . . come at
once within the pale of civilization and share the advantages of British rule.”
The minor resistances “are but the necessary incidents of the process by which a
superior race displaces an inferior one – incidents, in fact, of colonization itself,
and need suggest no reproach if we do but conduct ourselves with humanity
and good faith.” 128
Informal Imperialism in South America
We can now understand the critical difference between the global contexts in
which the British and U.S. empires operated. In the nineteenth century, for the
former empire, anticolonial nationalism had not yet dominated the global field,
and so it was much more feasible – hence more likely – for the British state
(and other European states for that matter) to employ direct colonial rule as a
means of exerting power over other societies. There was but one exception to
this pattern during the nineteenth century: South America. Notably, it is here
where the British state did what the United States did in the latter part of the
twentieth century: trade colonialism for informal imperialism.
Already by early to mid-century, South America had undergone centuries of
European rule. Already too South Americans had overthrown it. Independence
movements had erupted across the region, partly facilitated by Napoleon’s
occupation in 1808. By the 1820s, the Spanish and Portuguese empires in
the Americas were almost completely dismantled. In their wake emerged new
nations wedded to the nation-state ideal and principles of national sovereignty.
Britain recognized their sovereignty in 1822 at the Congress of Verona (the
following year the Monroe Doctrine essentially accomplished the same for
the United States). Even before the 1822 Congress of Verona, however, British
officials had seen something of the region’s nationalism. There was an invasion.
Lessons were learned.
The invasion originated in military leaders like naval commander Sir Home
Popham. During the Napoleonic Wars, Popham drew up plans to take Span-
ish America from Spain. 129 Some in London were skeptical of the grand
scheme, but others shared the dream. Therefore, in June of 1806, Popham and
his colonel, William Carr Beresford, descended on Buenos Aires with 1,600
troops. Upon his arrival to the outskirts of the city, Popham had learned that

the Spanish viceroy had fled to Montevideo, and the city of up to 70,000 inhab-
itants appeared open for the taking. Buenos Aires, as the capital of the Rı́o de
la Plata (encompassing present-day Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and parts
of Bolivia), was a prize. But the power of nationalist forces was soon felt. At
least two independence movements had already been active in the area before
the British occupation, and Creoles in the region “showed no enthusiasm for
exchanging the rule of a senile Bourbon for that of a mad Hanoverian” (as
one historian has aptly put it), and so they mobilized their forces. 130 Martin
de Alzaga and Juan Martı́n de Pueyrredón, local merchants who commanded
local influence, summoned civilian opposition within the city. Meanwhile, the
independence leader and naval captain Rafael D. del Villar Santiago de Liniers
mobilized more than 10,000 local gauchos and farmers, along with Spanish
soldiers, to advance on the city from the countryside. By August, they managed
to oust the British threat and recapture the city. 131 A second assault on Buenos
Aires, this time led by Lt. General John Whitelocke, and another on Monte-
video, fared no better: Whitelocke and his troops were forced to surrender and
flee back to England and Capetown.
The failed invasions imparted lasting lessons. One officer, Colonel Browne,
warned colleagues at home about nationalist resistance to foreign intervention:
“You have not a friend among the inhabitants of South America.” 132 After his
failed venture, Colonel Beresford wrote to Viscount Castlereagh, the foreign
secretary, to warn similarly about “the political sentiments of the great body of
the people.” Any attempt to conquer, occupy, and directly rule South American
would face utter failure, Beresford insisted: “for they are decidedly inclined to
throw off the yoke of Spain, they are still more hostile to receiving that of any
other nation, and we conquering it for ourselves would be carrying a millstone
about our necks, as they would be continually watching and plotting to get rid
of us.” 133 Castlereagh’s own advisors in London hit the same cautious notes.
Sir Arthur Wellesley counseled: “From what has lately passed at Buenos Ayres
[sic], and from all that I have read of these countries, I am convinced that any
attempt to conquer them, with a view to their future subjection to the British
Crown, would certainly fail.” 134
These warnings, undoubtedly animated by the hard experience of con-
fronting anticolonial nationalism head on in South America, directly influenced
Castlereagh. In turn they helped set the course for British policy toward the
region for much of the century. After the invasion of Buenos Aires, Castlereagh
wrote to the cabinet summarizing his thoughts on Britain’s relations with South
America. Castlereagh insisted that, in any dealings with South America, “it
seems indispensable that we should not present ourselves in any other light

than as auxiliaries and protectors” rather than as conquerors or invaders. This
was much like the way in which U.S. officials during the Cold War would
later try to win over the hearts and minds of third-world nationalists: Faced
with nationalist consciousness in South America, Castlereagh hoped that his
government would display sympathy for nationalist causes. Castlereagh then
searched for ways of exerting influence over South America without colonizing
it directly. The “question for the Cabinet to decide,” he wrote, “is . . . whether
some principle of acting more consonant to the sentiments and interests of the
people of South America cannot be taken up, which . . . may relieve us from
the hopeless task of conquering this extensive country, against the temper of
its population.” 135 The power of anticolonial nationalism in South America,
manifest clearly in the failed occupations of 1806 and 1807, compelled
Castlereagh to restrategize just as nationalist forces around the globe in the
twentieth century compelled the American state to reconsider its policies.
The British state’s approach to South America in subsequent decades fol-
lowed in part from the early lessons. Castlereagh himself did not write nor
promulgate a master blueprint for policy. But after the South American rev-
olutions of 1810–1825, a repertoire of tactics surfaced and were eventually
deployed. Direct colonization was out. “Dreams of imperialist expansion in
the Americas,” notes the historian Alan Knight, “were temporarily laid to
rest.” 136 Instead, the British state did what the American state later did when
it came face-to-face with anticolonial nationalism around the globe: It turned
to informal mechanisms of power. Bouts of blockades, political meddling,
unequal treaties, and financial discipline replaced territorial rule. By 1841,
James Murray’s influential memo in the Foreign Office turned the unstated
approach the British state had been taking into near official policy. Political
instability and “civil discord” in the region, opined Murray, had been threat-
ening British trade. This was all the more a threat given Britain’s increasing
economic interests in the region. Therefore, Murray stressed, “tranquility and
good Government in South America would be favourable to British interests.”
However, imposing “tranquility” through direct colonial control was not an
option; Murray did not even entertain it. Instead, he listed a range of tactics, all
of which fell short of annexation: “offensive and defensive alliance” with key
Latin American collaborators, trade treaties and financial meddling, vigorous
protection of British merchants and residents, and a stronger naval presence
threatening to deploy force should occasion demand. 137 This was informal
imperialism sketched on paper.
As the historian John Darwin puts it, informal imperialism in South America
was a “pragmatic acceptance of limited power” on the part of the British
state. 138 We can now see that British power was indeed limited, if only because

of the diametrically opposed power of anticolonial nationalism. Anticolonial
nationalism in the region made colonization too costly. South America in the
nineteenth century thus manifested regionally what the United States would
later face globally: a powerful anticolonial nationalist consciousness emanating
from the periphery to shape what the metropole would do. The lesson, in
the end, is the opposite of what exceptionalist thought teaches. The forms of
imperialism followed not from the character of the imperial nation, but from
the character of the fields of their application.5

– Alexander Dirom, Sketches of the State of the British Empire, 1828 (p. 72) 1
By 2009, at least sixty-two men and women who died in Iraq while serving in
the U.S. armed forces did not come from within the United States. They came
from the overseas territories of the United States: thirty-six from Puerto Rico;
six from the Virgin Islands; seven from Guam; five from the Northern Marianas;
and eight from American Samoa. An additional forty fatalities were American
Indians or Native Alaskans, and forty-eight were Native Hawaiians or Pacific
Islanders. 2 We should now know the significance of this. These numbers remind
us of the tragedies of war, but they also evoke imperial continuities. They
tell of connections between America’s history of imperial intervention and its
current imperial forays into the Middle East; of America’s long-standing status
as an imperial power; of resonances from the past to the present returns of
empire. President George W. Bush alluded to similar continuities and imperial
resonances when, in 2003, he gave a speech mentioning that “coalition forces,
including Filipino peacekeepers and medical workers, are working for the rise
of freedom and self-government in Iraq.” He gave that speech in Manila, on
the floor of the Philippine Congress that President William H. Taft had helped
establish in 1907.
Referring to these imperial continuities, however, also raises questions about
discontinuities. After all, when the United States seized the Philippine Islands
and other overseas territories, it was only an ascending global power; merely
a “New Empire,” as Brooks Adams declared famously in 1903, positioning

itself to take over the world. The more recent imperial forays into Iraq have
occurred in a very different climate, a very different geopolitical context. The
United States has not been a hegemon ascending but a hegemon falling. Rather
than a promising new player on the world scene whose imperial expansion
once matched its youthful exuberance, the United States has been an aging
empire watching dreadfully as rivals threaten to take their slice of the pie. In
this very different context, what does imperial expansion mean?
One goal of this chapter is to address this question by casting a compara-
tive eye on the British empire in the late nineteenth century. Britain too had
faced economic decline. Beginning in the 1870s, rival powers like Germany,
Russia, and the United States among others grasped increasing shares of world
economic output. As a result, Britain’s economic dominance was unsettled.
Britain’s economic decline thus prefigured America’s decline in the late twenti-
eth century. So what did this mean for their empires? As Britain and the United
States began to face new competition from rivals, did their previous imperial
modalities or intensities change too? Great powers can fall indeed; the pur-
pose of this chapter to wonder whether such falls from economic dominance
correspond with changes in imperial activity.
Features of Decline
Clarification is in order. We have said that Britain and the United States
experienced decline, but the meaning of decline here should be foregrounded.
Although there are a variety of ways to define the term, we refer to it in the
narrow sense of hegemonic decline; that is, a fall in the hegemonic nations’ rel-
ative economic standing in the world system. Decline does not mean a decrease
in prestige or military power, although these things may accompany decline.
It rather means a relative decrease in economic standing. What proportion of
the world economy do the nations command? What is the nations’ share of
world GDP? This also means that decline is relative; relative to the nations’
prior standing and to the economic standing of other nations in the system.
Hegemonic nations enjoy a monopoly or preponderance over the world econ-
omy. When that share over world economic output decreases because rival
powers are taking up more and more shares of their own, then the hegemon is
in decline according to this definition.
Decline does not mean that the nation suddenly descends into the ranks of
the world’s poorest countries. In fact, during their periods of decline, both the
United States and Britain remained among the world’s most economically pow-
erful countries. The point is that, relative to their previous economic monopoly
of the world’s productive powers and to the capacities of other nations, they
descended. Furthermore, decline by this definition means that the global eco-
nomic field as a whole is undergoing transformation. As the hegemon declines
because rival nations take up a greater share of the world economy, the entire
system passes from a condition of unipolarity – with one nation the economic168
Patterns of Empire
winner – to a multipolar economic condition. A near-monopoly structure in
the global economic field passes into a more competitive structure.
Using this definition, many scholars have traced Britain’s decline. Most
agree it began in 1868 and was exacerbated with the 1873 crash on the Vienna
money market. After 1873 came the “long depression” that lasted at least until
1896. 3 This depression was part of the decline. It was marked by a worldwide
overproduction of agricultural and industrial goods, especially in iron and steel,
and decreasing profits. 4 It was also accompanied by rising unemployment and
slower economic growth. The depression came in fits and starts. There was a
period during the 1870s, for example, when some in the British business sector
and the policy elite were comparably optimistic about the economic situation.
Yet the overarching trends throughout the period remained consistent. From
1820 to 1840, industrial production had grown at an annual rate of about
4 percent and, from 1840 to 1870, about 3 percent. But between 1875 and
1894 it grew only at 1.5 percent annually. 5 By 1879, British economists and
policy makers were already worrying, culminating in the establishment of a
Royal Commission to investigate the “Depression of Trade and Industry.” The
commission concluded that there was a “serious depression, affecting most
trades and industries, characterized by surplus production, low prices, poor
investment opportunities and unemployment.” 6
The depression was just one dimension of the larger issue; that is, compe-
tition from rising economic rivals, especially Germany and the United States.
This means that even though the British economy was not disastrous in absolute
terms, it was significantly challenged in relative terms. Although some British
industries such as coal or textiles increased their output, for example, their
relative share of world production diminished. In other industries like steel,
chemicals, and electrical goods, Britain lost its earlier advantage. 7 British agri-
culture likewise faced competition, as grain imports from the United States and
South America posed new trouble. And generally, imports in multiple sectors
rose. 8 “We import half our food,” complained Dilke in his 1890, Problems of
Greater Britain; “we import the immense masses of raw material which are
essential to our industry.” 9
Britain’s declining competitiveness can be seen by comparing relative shares
of world manufacturing output. During the height of British hegemony,
Britain’s manufacturing output constituted 19.9 percent of the world’s total,
creeping up to 22.9 percent in 1880. Its share only slightly declined to 18.5
percent in 1900, but it fell to 13.6 in 1913. Most important, the United States
and Germany increasingly took greater shares. By 1900, the United States had

already surpassed Britain. By 1913, Germany had too. Relative decline is also
evident in Thompson’s index of “leading sector share,” which affirms the fig-
ures on world manufacturing output. This includes not just manufacturing, but
a range of sectors that show a continual decline in Britain’s leading sector share:
from .546 in 1850 to .430 in 1880 to .333 in 1890 and to .146 by 1910. 10
In this context, it is not surprising that writers and analysts continually spoke
of doom. The “dream” of Britain as the workshop of the world, wrote one
in 1870, had become “a dream of the past. . . . Other nations have entered the
race, and although we are still the great traders of the world, the singularity of
our position has gone.” 11 Another writer warned, “there seems to be reason-
able grounds for fearing that England’s commercial supremacy may already be
in danger.” 12 These worries about rivals became all the more common as the
years continued.
The United States experienced a similar decline, beginning in the 1970s
in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis. 13 As with Britain’s decline, there was an
initial recession marked by decreasing profits and productivity. The average
annual increase in labor productivity in the United States from 1948 to 1973
was 2.8 percent, but from 1981 to 1986 it was only 1.2 percent. The rate of
profit in America’s traditional sectors like manufacturing fell similarly. 14 There
was a brief stint of optimism through the 1990s, reflected in scholarship and
pundits who declared that America was not in fact declining, and that it was
just taking the lead in other areas beyond its traditional manufacturing base:
that is, in service or technology and finance. 15 This too was similar to Britain’s
decline: There had been in Britain a brief period of optimism after the initial
recession. And as with the British case, the optimism about the United States
proved far too hopeful. Britain had also gained ground during its decline in
finance and service; some have claimed that the turn to such industries is not
a transcendence of decline but its dominant sign. 16 In any case, the apparent
boom of the 1990s was but a bubble that already began to burst before the end
of the decade. 17
These domestic economic issues aside, America’s economic standing in rel-
ative terms fell from the mid-1970s while competitors rose and continued to
rise. Initially, beginning in the late 1960s even, the key competition came from
Japan and Germany. Beginning in the late 1980s came the European Union as
a whole, the rise of Russia as a potential economic monster, and then China.

Patterns of Empire
Various measures show this. One useful measure has to do with the largest
multinational corporations. In 1956, forty-two of the biggest fifty multination-
als in the world were American. The rest of the world only had eight. By 1980,
only twenty-three were American. The number of European firms was about
equal. Throughout, the Japanese increased their number of firms in the top
fifty. 18 Other data show a continuation of the trend through the 1990s and
into the 2000s. Non-American firms constituted nine of the ten largest elec-
tronics and electrical equipment manufacturers in the world; eight of the ten
largest auto makers and utility companies (gas and electric); seven of the ten
largest petroleum refiners; and six of the ten largest telecommunication compa-
nies. Half of the ten largest pharmaceutical firms were non-American too. Of
the top one hundred corporations in the world in 2000, as ranked by foreign-
held assets, only twenty-three were American. “Together, Germany, France,
the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, with a combined gross domestic
product (GDP) seven-tenths that of the US, had forty; Japan had sixteen. Dur-
ing the 1990s, the share of US multinationals in the foreign sales of the world’s
one hundred largest multinationals decreased from 30 to 25 percent; the share
of EU-based companies increased from 41 to 46 percent.” 19
Measures regarding shares of the world economy are similarly informative.
In 1950, the United States supplied half of the world’s gross product; in 2002
it only supplied 21 percent. Sixty percent of manufacturing production in the
world in 1950 came from the United States, but that fell to only 25 percent by
1999. Studies using somewhat different measures arrive at the same conclusion.
In 1999, the United States contributed only 28 percent to world GDP, whereas
the European Union had 30 percent of the total. Japan was only 12 percent and
China’s only 4 percent, but East Asia (excluding Japan) was the world’s fastest-
growing economy since the late 1990s. 20 In 2007, The Economist magazine
scoffed “Come on number one, your time is up.” 21 In 2004, the Institute for
International Economics (which included on its board prominent economists
and policy makers like Paul Volcker and Larry Summers) had determined that
“the United States is no longer the world’s dominant economic entity.” 22
Both the United States and Britain experienced decline, but was decline
accompanied by a shift or change in imperialism too?
Britain’s New Imperialism, 1870s–1914
It is by now well established that something about British imperialism changed
in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The English economist J. A. Hobson
in 1902 characterized it as a “new aggressive Imperialism” and an “expansion

171
of British political despotism.” 23 Countless other analysts since have spoken
of Britain’s “new imperialism.” The idea was not questioned until Robinson
and Gallagher’s seminal article on the “imperialism of free trade.” On the one
hand, Robinson and Gallagher were suspicious of the notion that there was a
new imperialism at the end of the nineteenth century. In their view, Britain had
been continuously imperialistic throughout the century. On the other hand,
Robinson and Gallagher’s overarching point was not to deny that a change
occurred at all. Their claim was that British imperialism was continuous at
one level but discontinuous on another. Specifically, Britain was continuously
imperialistic, but it changed the mode or form of imperialism. Britain in the
mid-century preferred informal imperialism, but during the late nineteenth
century – concomitant with its relative decline – the British state tended to
replace informal with formal modes. 24
Following from this characterization, we can indeed detect a new imperial-
ism in the late nineteenth century coinciding with Britain’s economic decline.
It involved a shift from informal to formal modes of imperialism. To be sure,
many of the areas that Britain had previously declined to colonize during
its period of hegemony were put under direct British control in this decline
period. Whereas the British state had rejected ideas of taking Fiji in the 1860s,
it changed its mind in 1874 and seized it. Whereas Palmerston had long rejected
the idea of taking Egypt as a colony, in 1882 British forces entered the terri-
tory, defeated Egyptian forces in the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, and subsequently
remained. Whereas the 1865 Parliamentary Select Committee had warned
against extensions of British sovereignty over West African territories, in the
1880s Britain announced various protectorates along the Bights of Biafra and
Benin, over Niger Delta states, and eventually over the entire coast of what
the British called the Oil River States (later Nigeria). In East Africa, where
clientelism had previously been the rule, the British declared protectorates
over Somaliland (1887) and, with the help of Frederick Lugard’s East Africa
Company, over Buganda (1894). Britain also took greater responsibility over
Sarawak, whereas it had denied it before (the Foreign Office in 1888 took
charge of Sarawak’s external affairs). The policy of hands-off became one of
hands-on.
The British state also went further by intensifying or extending its control
over other areas too. In South Africa, Britain took the Traansvaal as a colony
in 1877 and in 1879 took Zululand. From 1877 through the early 1890s,
it declared protectorates over Somaliland, Matabeleland (and the areas later
forming Rhodesia), and Nyasaland. In what would become Malaysia in South-
east Asia, Britain established the Residency system (1874), slowly extended its
influence through the region, and eventually constructed the Federated Malay
States (1896). It further established a protectorate over Brunei (1888), seized

it, see Kennedy (1984) and Louis (1976).172

Burma as a colony in 1886, and sent British advisors to Thailand to help direct
its financial and economic policies. 25 In the Pacific, besides seizing Fiji, Britain
extended its rule over New Guinea (1884) and the Cook Islands (1881) while
establishing the High Commission of the Western Pacific in 1877 to extend its
control over the small islands of Gilbert, Ellice, the Soloman Islands, and the
Pitcairn group; it further sent advisors to the monarchs of Tonga and Samoa. In
short, there was both a shift away from informal strategies toward formal rule
as well as an extension and intensification of political influence. The number
of new colonies shows the trend. As Figure 5.1 reveals, the number of new
territories directly annexed by Britain increased markedly in the last decades
of the nineteenth century.
There is another sense in which Britain’s imperialism shifted. Attendant
with the extension or intensification of political control over peripheral areas
was increased militaristic aggression. Of course, the British state had never
been shy about using its military during its period of hegemony. However, the
late century brought with it new military ventures. A look at the number of

military interventions initiated over the course of the century shows a higher
amplitude and a greater frequency during Britain’s period of decline compared
with the previous period (see Figure 5.2). These included small wars with Arab
slave traders in Nyasaland (1885–1889), attacks in West Africa on the Yonni
(1887–1889), war with the Zulus (1887), the 1885 attack on Khartoum, the
1877–1878 Kaffir War, the 1878–1880 Anglo-Afghan war, and the Boer War,
among others. In some cases, this use of force was related to the new territorial
drive. Annexing Burma, for example, involved a war of conquest employing a
military force 25,000 strong.
In short, Britain’s new imperialism was not exactly a shift away from anti-
imperialism. It was not about an absence of imperial power giving way to its
presence. It was rather a change in the modalities and intensity of imperial
power. It was a shift from indirect control to colonial rule as well as a new
aggression – a greater willingness to blatantly use military power or otherwise
establish formal political control. Rather than relying on clientelist networks,
Britain became more and more determined to replace with them with colonial
rule. And rather than sit idly by, the British state was more willing to use174
Patterns of Empire
military power over others. British imperialism became more direct – more
bold and aggressive.
There is yet a final feature to Britain’s new imperialism: a shift in discourse.
We have seen already that mid-Victorian Britons did not utter “empire” con-
sistently or frequently. When they did utter it, they did not typically associate it
with a formal overseas empire consisting of foreign lands and peoples around
the globe. This changed in the latter part of the century. It became more com-
mon to associate “empire” with all of Britain’s overseas domains. 26 What
was once a term exclusively for the United Kingdom became a term encom-
passing Britain’s colonial spaces as well. When, for example, Councillor of
Salford J. Snape gave a lecture on “The Trade of the British Empire” to the
Conservative Club in 1882, he included under the rubric “empire” Britain’s
overseas possessions in the Americas and Asia. 27 An 1876 atlas on the “Geog-
raphy of the British Empire” likewise defined the “British Empire” to include
“the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the numerous for-
eign possessions, situated in nearly every part of the world, called Colonies
and Dependencies.” 28 A new coherence was thus given to Britain’s overseas
activity and modalities of colonial governance. Furthermore, there was a shift
in emotional investment. During the middle part of the century, most of the
English population was either ignorant of or ambivalent about the phrase
British empire. However, as the historian Kitson Clark observes, beginning
in the 1870s or so, “more and more people in Britain seem to have become
aware of the Empire as an entity, possibly as a source of problems, possibly
a source of pride.” The term empire acquired a “deeper moral significance
and a greater emotive force” than before. 29 Finally, there was a change in
the extent of discourse about empire too. The number of articles using the
phrase the “British Empire” in the London Times increased in the late nine-
teenth century, with only one comparable peak around 1855 (see Figure 3.1,
previous chapter). This suggests that not only did the British empire become
more militaristic and imperialistic in the territorial mode, it also became more
vocal and self-conscious – a renewed cultural assertion to match its new global
aggression.
American Aggression Resurgent
Has the United States undergone a similar shift in its imperial activities during
its decline? If there was an American counterpart to Britain’s new imperialism,
we might expect to find the United States doing exactly what Britain did: that
is, becoming more aggressive militarily and territorially. Just as Britain showed
a tendency away from informal imperialism and toward formal imperialism,

175
we would expect the United States to have done the same during its period
of decline. Yet there is good reason to think that an American counterpart to
Britain’s new imperialism – if there was a counterpart at all – would not take
the form of colonization. As seen in a previous chapter, the global context
changed significantly in the twentieth century. Especially after the 1960s, it no
longer became possible to annex new territories as formal colonies. Even if the
American state did become more imperialistic during its period of decline, we
would not expect it to come in colonial form.
What, then, would be a reasonable American counterpart to Britain’s new
imperialism, given the changed global context of the late twentieth and early
twenty-first century? Rather than a shift from informal imperialism to for-
mal imperialism, we might expect an expansion or intensification of informal
imperialism marking a new boldness and aggression. That is, rather than covert
operations or financial aid to realize its goals, we would expect the United States
to show a greater willingness to use military force or deploy other direct mecha-
nisms of power such as temporary military occupations. We would also expect
the sheer frequency and amplitude of such exercises in imperial power to have
heightened during the period of decline compared with America’s period of
hegemony. This would mark a new aggression, a new assertion of power, akin
to Britain’s in the late nineteenth century.
Some scholars have taken America’s invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003
as a sign of such a new imperialism. To be sure, it represented a relatively novel
use of imperial power. The so-called Coalition Provisional Authority that ruled
Iraq from 2003 to 2004 was a colonial government of sorts, reporting to the
Department of Defense. This was not just a military invasion. The occupation
of Afghanistan is similar: Unlike the military interventions that occurred after
World War II through the 1970s, it involved not only a military campaign
but also a period of military rule and political control. America’s dealings
with Iraq and Afghanistan therefore suggest that the United States had become
more willing to act as an imperial power, with a new determination and verve
to overtly manage the affairs of other countries.
If Iraq and Afghanistan are the only examples of a new imperialism, how-
ever, America’s new imperialism pales in comparison with Britain’s. With only
two instances compared with Britain’s more general and expanded imperial-
ism, America’s new imperialism would hardly seem to be indicative of anything
at all. At most it simply would be attributable to a single event: September 11,
2001. Without the tragedy of September 11, there might not have been the
invasion of either Iraq or Afghanistan. There would be no new imperialism
over which to ponder. Even if they were not solely due to September 11, they
could be readily dismissed as a blip; two exceptions reflecting the particular
desires of Bush the Younger’s administration. If that were the case, again there
would be little similarity to Britain’s new imperialism. Britain’s new imperi-
alism was extensive and consistent, and it occurred by the hand of different
political parties in power.176
Patterns of Empire
Yet the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan can be seen as part of a bigger
trend. Rather than only a response to September 11 or a reflection of Bush
the Younger’s administration alone, they are the culmination of a resurgent
imperialism that had already begun to unfold years earlier. First, America’s
dealings with Iraq had occurred long before September 11. The first assault
on Iraq was initiated by Bush the Elder in 1991. The Clinton administration
extended the 1991 invasion with a barrage of air strikes through the rest of the
decade. The war on Iraq did not begin in 2003. It began in 1991. It continued
through Clinton’s presidency and was merely picked up by the George W. Bush
administration.
Second, and perhaps more important, the United States during its period
of economic decline had been adopting a more aggressive and imperialistic
approach to other areas in the world besides Iraq. The first instances of this
new imperialism surfaced in the early 1980s, a time when America’s economic
decline in the previous decade had become painfully palpable. 30 In this period,
in 1983, President Ronald Reagan authorized a force that ultimately totaled
7,000 troops to invade the island of Grenada. The force defeated the local
People’s Revolutionary Army and Militia and, within days, established control
over Grenada’s 100,000 inhabitants. Comparably speaking this was a “little
war.” But it is significant because it was the first use of American combat
troops in the Caribbean in almost twenty years and the first major use of
military force abroad since the Vietnam War. 31 The United States had gotten
over its “Vietnam syndrome.” To be sure, in 1988, President George H. Bush
authorized yet another military invasion, this time of Panama, deploying some
24,000 U.S. troops. Grenada was the first major military deployment since
Vietnam; the Panama invasion was the largest. 32
Grenada and Panama were only small parts in a bigger play of renewed U.S.
militarism in the Southern Hemisphere. In 1993, President Clinton ordered
U.S. ships to embargo Haiti; in 1994 he decided to use 20,000 U.S. troops
to occupy the country. The last U.S. troops did not leave Haiti for another
six years. And later, in 2004, U.S. troops returned to Haiti for yet another
occupation. There were also troop deployments to Colombia, Bolivia, and
Peru as part of the war on drugs. Of course, covert tactics, typical of America’s
hegemonic period, persisted throughout. Reagan’s support of the contras in
Nicaragua is probably the only well-known example of them. However, the
overt military deployments together suggest a greater willingness on the part
of the American state to directly and openly intervene in the hemisphere than
in previous decades. In fact, during the entire period from 1946 to 1982, there
had been only one overt major U.S. operation in the Latin America, Central
American, and Caribbean region. That was the deployment of troops to the
Dominican Republic in 1965.

These military operations occurred in Latin, Central, and South America:
areas firmly within the United States’ traditional sphere of influence. Other
regions of the world, however, were also visited by the hand of American
militarism. The 1980s saw interventions not only in Panama, Grenada, and
Haiti, but also small troop deployments to Chad, Sinai, Egypt, Libya, the
Persian Gulf, and Lebanon. The 1990s did not stop the trend. Besides the
attack on Iraq in 1991 and continued strikes thereafter, the United States sent
troops to Somalia, Kuwait, Zaire, Bosnia, Croatia, Haiti, Sudan, and Nigeria.
The United States used military power twice in the Balkans and sent troops
for an occupation mission, leading some scholars to call Clinton’s presidency
an “imperial presidency.” 33 In light of this information, the claims of world-
systems specialists like Giovanni Arrighi and Immanuel Wallerstein, who claim
that the early 1980s mark a “drastic change in U.S. [foreign] policies,” ring
true. 34
Some systematic data can help. The basic question is: Did the United States
resort to military power to a greater extent during its period of decline than
during its period of hegemony? One source for addressing this question is
the 1999 report of the U.S. Commission on National Security, a blue-ribbon
commission appointed by the U.S. government to consider America’s national
security policies. The report shows that during the decade of the 1990s alone,
the United States had embarked on four times as many military operations
as it had since the late 1940s. 35 This in itself is telling, but more in-depth
data culled from other government documents and reports help round out the
picture. If we count all of the overt military operations by the United States
(including air raids and naval operations) from 1946 to 2004 (which was the
first year after the invasion of Iraq), we see a trend. There is a higher frequency
and amplitude in U.S. military interventions during the period attendant with
America’s economic decline (beginning in the 1980s) than during America’s
period of hegemonic maturity (1946 to the 1970s) (Figure 5.3). Military power
was meted out in disproportion to America’s relative economic power.
A few points demand elaboration here. First, the figures represent the num-
ber of interventions initiated. It does not refer to the duration of interventions.
Still, duration might have more to do with other logics or factors besides his-
torical phases. It might, for example, reflect the amount of domestic or local
resistance to the intervention, the relative amount of military resources avail-
able, or various other events. What matters is the decision to employ force; the
decision on the part of the government to reach and act beyond its borders –
either by the deployment of troops, the use of air strikes, sending military sup-
port, or temporary military occupation. Second, the figures do not show the
actual number of troops deployed. If the United States used less and less troops
in the decline period, despite the raw number of actual discrete interventions,

it might not represent a significant change or greater willingness to resort to
military power. However, there are good reasons why troop numbers are not
necessarily as informative as raw numbers of discrete interventions. One is
that greater troop numbers might reflect the amount of local resistance to the
intervention, the relative amount of military resources available, or various
other events. If the U.S. military first intervenes and later escalates troops or
resources, does this just reflect a contingent military strategy for winning the
war or unexpected local resistance? Furthermore, comparing troop numbers
over time would not necessarily be informative, due to the historical develop-
ment of military technology. The use of one thousand ground troops in the
1953 might not be comparable to the use of one thousand troops in 1983,
because the advances in military infrastructure mean that less troops might be
necessary in the latter intervention, even if the troops were sent for the same
kind of mission (and even if the proportion of troops to local population was
the same). Yet even if we do count troops deployed, we still find that the United
States employed greater military force during its decline period than during its
period of hegemonic maturity. From 1946 to 1980, a span of thirty-four years,
American troops used in military interventions totaled about 882,000. This
includes Vietnam. Alternatively, during the smaller time span of twenty-five
years, from 1981 to 2004, the total number of American troops deployedWeary Titans

in military interventions – by even the most conservative estimate – reached
1,425,809.
Further data helps affirm these findings and extend them. What if we com-
pare covert operations to overt military activity? As discussed in a previous
chapter, the United States during its period of hegemonic maturity constructed
an informal empire partially based on a network of clients. This involved out-
flows of foreign aid to keep the clients in check. But it also, at times, involved
electoral engineering and other types of covert activity to secure the victories
of clients or keep them in power. Figure 5.4 suggests that, during America’s
period of hegemonic maturity, the American state preferred to use such tac-
tics to direct military intervention. The data also show that those methods
decreased as America’s new imperialism was unleashed. Covert operations and
electoral engineering were an alternative mechanism to direct military interven-
tion. And during America’s period of hegemonic decline, the American state
preferred to use the latter than the former; marking a clear willingness to be
overtly aggressive.
Just as Britain embarked on a new imperialism marked by increasing aggres-
sion during its period of decline, so too did the United States during its compa-
rable phase of decline. Yet there is another similarity. Attendant with Britain’s
new imperialism, we have seen that there was a rise in talk about the British
empire. American discourse of empire also appears to have proliferated during
its period of decline (see Figure 5.5). The number of articles containing the
phrase “American Empire” in the New York Times is small during America’s180

period of hegemony, peaking at only three articles per year. However, a jump
in the number of articles occurs in the late 1960s and carries through the 1980s.
There was a slight dip in the early 1990s, but the number of articles picks up
again in the mid-1990s and builds up to 2003. Clearly, talk of American empire
proliferated after key events like Vietnam and September 11, 2001, and much
can be attributed to those events alone. Yet the rise in discourse in the other
years shows that the new imperial consciousness – just like the new militarism –
was not restricted exclusively to those events. America’s new imperialism has
been more pervasive than a single event can disclose.
In short, both Britain and the United States embarked on new imperialisms
during their respective periods of decline. The forms differed slightly. Britain’s
new imperialism was marked by a shift from informal modes of control to direct
colonial annexation and increased militarism, whereas America’s new imperi-
alism primarily involved a shift from overt modalities of influence to more
direct militaristic aggression and temporary military occupations. But both
states intensified their direct imperialism while adopting more bold modalities
of power. Both became more aggressive. And both did so during their respective
periods of decline. This raises the question of whether decline was systemati-
cally associated with the new imperialisms and, if so, exactly how. We cannotWeary Titans
181
assume a direct connection. The coincidence between decline and the new
imperialisms could very well be just that: a coincidence. A closer examination
is warranted.
Explaining Britain’s New Imperialism
Ever since the founding works of Herbert Spencer and J. A. Hobson, scholars
have long examined and debated the forces or causes behind Britain’s new
imperialism. 36 Yet despite the vast literature, there has been little consensus
on which factor best explains British imperialism. This is partially because
historians adjudicating the different explanations have looked at particular
instances of the new imperialism to find some but not all factors at work. 37
A different approach would be to first consider the wider historical context
in which the new imperialism unfolded. Rather than look for a single causal
force, this approach would have us locate a conjuncture of possible factors
that created a wider climate and a set of enabling conditions for increased
imperial aggression. By this approach, we will see three forces in particular:
economic crisis, geopolitical threats, and peripheral instability. We will then
examine some specific instances of the new imperialism – from the invasion of
Abyssinia to the annexation of Fiji, among others – to see the forces at work
in particular contexts.
The New Context
One important novel feature of the late nineteenth century had to do with the
economy: As seen, after enjoying decades of dominance in the world economy,
Britain faced increasing competition from rivals and began its decline. But it is
important to specify how this broader economic process played out in particu-
lar sites. First, at home, economic decline meant bouts of economic depression
marked by unemployment and falling rates of profit. This in turn led to sociopo-
litical unrest. Public demonstrations after the 1866 crash, for instance, raised
fears among the upper classes and the political elite that the “flood-gates to
anarchy” were being opened and that revolutionary mobs would take power
(as had happened in Paris in 1848). 38 John Godfrey, president of the Patriotic
Association of Marylebone, worried in 1882 that “our power, our greatness,
our character abroad, are being ruined; our trade destroyed; and at home,
our country disgraced by a state of lawlessness, anarchy, assassination, and
crime, causing in the wide civilized world an expression of contempt and loud

Spencer (1902). Spencer’s themes were picked up in Schumpeter’s Imperialism and Social
Classes. Hobson’s theory set the conditions for Lenin’s explanation of imperialism as the
“highest stage of capitalism” and a variety of subsequent Marxist and neo-Marxist theories.
See for overviews Brewer (1990), Etherington (1982), and Mommsen (1982) among others.
Robinson and Gallagher’s “excentric” theory later emerged, as have more recent variations on

reproach for the loss of that energy, power, and practical action of the old
English character.” 39
Economic decline, secondly, meant that economic interests abroad were put
at new risk. Part of the reason why Britain faced domestic economic troubles
in the first place was that Germany and the United States, and even France
and Russia to some extent, were increasing their market shares and productive
capacities; and this competition added another layer of threat to the economic
and political elite. Investigations by the Royal Commission on Trade and Indus-
try in the mid-1880s concluded that surplus production, low prices, and weak
investment opportunities were the culprits for Britain’s new economic woes.
Most representatives from industry blamed foreign competition rather than ris-
ing workers’ wages. The view was that rival countries’ agricultural and rising
manufacturing production was keeping prices and profits low. Other observers
repeatedly worried that those countries’ growth in production, coupled with
Britain’s free trade orientation, had made Britain increasingly dependent on
imports. Ostensibly, this economic competition was worsened by rivals’ pro-
tectionist tariffs. 40 The United States had been maintaining high tariffs since
the Civil War. There were substantial tariff hikes across Europe, with increases
occurring in Russia, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France between 1877 and
1882 and continuing through the 1890s. 41 In this context, it is not surprising
that British capitalists and merchants became increasingly fearful. As one his-
torian notes, at the end of the 1870s, the commercial confidence of previous
decades “were replaced by feelings of uncertainty, even of insecurity, and many
merchants began to fear that Britain’s commercial supremacy was no longer
something they could take for granted.” 42
Another important factor to the new context was geopolitical. The rise of
rival economic powers came not only with economic threats, but also new
political and security threats. 43 One such threat had to do with the Euro-
pean Continent. During the mid-nineteenth century, Britain had been able to
avoid massive military commitments on the Continent by building a balance of
military and political power between the European states. However, with the
Franco-Prussian War and the subsequent unification of Prussia and Italy, this
balance of power was unsettled. Disraeli, in his 1871 response to the Franco-
Prussian War, feared that the balance of power was “entirely destroyed.”
Britain faced “a new world, new influences at work, new and unknown objects
and dangers.” 44 The European threat coincided with other dangers too. Amer-
ica’s economic ascendance in the wake of the Civil War and the unification of
Prussia and Italy portended a world in which size was increasingly important

for power. An “era of big states” loomed on the horizon and many worried if
“little England” would survive the new landscape. Might Britain, one writer
worried, “sink as Holland had sunk into a community of harmless traders?” 45
Furthermore, rival states were not only unifying but also expanding overseas.
France was taking on increasing involvement in Tahiti (1880), Tunis (1881),
Tonkin (1882), and Madagascar (1884), among others; Germany was captur-
ing its own colonies just as it was expanding its overseas commercial activity;
the United States in the wake of the Civil War was making its presence felt more
and more in the Caribbean and Latin America; Russia was advancing toward
Afghanistan and building railways in Central Asia; and Japan was casting its
eye ever more outward. 46 The growing military power of these rivals made
matters worse still. Although Britain maintained its naval dominance in these
years, other states were slowly building up their naval capacities. 47 “Great
Britain,” Francis and Tebbitt warned in 1880, “must be prepared for hostile
combinations in the future, far exceeding in potency those whose fate our his-
tory recounts.” 48 Meanwhile, General Charles George Gordon’s humiliating
defeat at Khartoum in 1885 put into question the capacity of the British army. 49
The final relevant development in the late nineteenth century had to do
with the periphery of Britain’s imperial system. As noted in a previous chapter,
British imperialism in the mid-Victorian period partly involved the creation of
client states and collaborative regimes abroad that helped Britain extend trade
and maintain a network of security for it. This was informal empire layered
on top of Britain’s formal empire. But informal empire itself created the possi-
bility for new troubles and tensions. As it brought British consuls, merchants,
missionaries, and explorers to new lands, and as it brought foreign aid, capital,
and commodities, so too did it increase the possibility of conflict. The political
logic of informal rule itself carried the possibility for such conflict. British pro-
consuls, advisors, or enterprises established collaborative relations with local
rulers, but local rulers or chiefs could become recalcitrant to British aims over
time. “The danger of new friendly overtures with Natives,” recognized the
parliamentary undersecretary in 1868, when confronted with suggestions to
extend British informal influence over the Malaya states, “is that they always
take them to mean more than they do.” 50 Additionally, collaborative relations
with one ruler or another could provoke resentment or aggression from neigh-
boring rivals with their own agendas. In the Gold Coast, British settlements,
Beecroft’s attempts to curb the slave trading, and commercial trade with the
Fanti all invoked the ire of the Fanti’s enemies (the Ashanti Confederation),
which in turn precipitated clashes with British forces.

Patterns of Empire
Informal empire also entailed the influx of financial aid or capital invest-
ment to new areas, which could disrupt local economies and foment social
unrest or political disorder. Resentment from below could be unleashed, local
rulers or princes might find themselves financially indebted, and the local rulers’
capacities to maintain legitimate power (and therefore serve as effective clients
to British overlords) could be undermined. In Burma, Britain’s trade treaties
in 1862 and 1867 with Prince Mindon compelled Mindon to impose “polit-
ically troublesome levels of direct taxation on his subjects,” which, among
other events, put the country into socioeconomic crisis by 1878. 51 Similarly,
in Egypt, the establishment of free trade in 1841, financial aid and lending,
and the overthrow by Britain and France of the Khedivate led to economic
crises as well as indignation among local landlords, the military, and Muslim
religious leaders, leading to a wave of antiforeign sentiment and protonation-
alist revolt. 52 The potential for these scenarios around other parts of the world
probably increased in the late nineteenth century not only because of Britain’s
informal political influence, but also because of the increased export of British
capital to peripheral regions. British capital exports rose significantly during
the 1850s to the 1870s and dramatically increased after the 1870s in response
to the perceived lack of investment opportunities at home. 53
In short, three new forces marked Britain’s period of economic decline: eco-
nomic crisis, geopolitical threats, and peripheral instability. Admittedly, not all
of these forces were new. Britain had faced the threat of military rivals before.
It had always been concerned about maintaining security while simultane-
ously striving to maintain and expand its trade. It had also faced the potential
for disorder in its informal (and colonial) empire. However, as Paul Kennedy
points out: “What was different now was that the relative power of the various
challenger states was much greater, while the threats seemed to be developing
almost simultaneously.” 54 In this sense, the world faced by Britain in the late
nineteenth century was indeed different from that of the mid-century, not least
because of hegemonic decline. This was the structure of the conjuncture that
propelled the new imperialism.
Context to Causation
To see the forces at work, consider some notable cases of Britain’s new impe-
rialism. The invasion of Abyssinia in 1867 is one such notable case, not least
because it has been taken by some scholars as a critical turning point. On
the one hand, the invasion was not exactly indicative of the new imperial-
ism. British forces did not remain there and instead left behind an officially
independent client rather than a colony. On the other hand, it was indeed a
turning point. Previously, Britain had maintained a relatively cautious approach

to Africa, preferring informal rule to colonization. However, the invasion of
Abyssinia reversed this previous hesitation to intervene. It was followed by
various other new interventions into the region. In these ways, the Abyssinian
invasion marked a radical turn, a “decisive break with the past.” 55
So what induced this break with the past? Part of the answer lies in periph-
eral instability brought on by informal empire. The pretext for the invasion was
King Theodore’s seizure of Europeans, including some diplomats and mission-
aries. The British consul to the area, Walter Plowden, who had been attempting
to expand trade, was killed in 1860 amidst disorder and unrest that had been
sporadically erupting in the region. This was not the only factor, however.
In fact, British interests in the region were comparably minor, which is why
the British state had been relatively indifferent to Plowden and his post. The
Foreign Office had even felt that the British presence in the region should just
be withdrawn entirely, for a continued presence might “involve us in com-
plications . . . most desirable for the future to avoid.” 56 In other words, there
was peripheral instability, but the British state did not have to intervene: It
could have just let things go. Hence, what tipped the balance toward inter-
vention was the fact of British economic decline. In May 1866, a wave of
bankruptcies swept financial circles, and the repercussions of “Black Friday”
were felt all over the nation. The sudden decline of profits put the middle
classes into an unforeseen precarious position; food prices rose; the London
shipbuilding industry fell apart; and unemployment and poverty proliferated.
The depression was seen as “one of the most painful and severe of the cen-
tury.” It was accompanied by public protests against the administration of Lord
Derby. 57
This situation contributed to the invasion of Abyssinia. According to histo-
rian Freda Harcourt, the Disraeli government resorted to imperialism as a way
to manage the economic crisis. Disraeli decided to invade Abyssinia as a unify-
ing tactic to restore the government’s popularity. Diverse social classes could
rally around the flag. The invasion would demonstrate to the populace that
Britain still had muscle despite the economic crisis and despite rivals’ economic
advances. It would confirm “Britain’s position as a great power in a rapidly
changing world . . . serve as a focus for the energies of the whole nation and
provide a foundation for national unity.” 58 Fittingly, after the battle, Northcote
told Napier, “Where we were considered the weakest of military nations we
have shown ourselves the strongest. . . . This expedition . . . will have effected as
great an alteration in our position in the eyes of Europe as the battle of Sadowa
effected in the position of Prussia.” 59 The popular press likewise basked in
the glory of victory, constructing it as Britain’s “rehabilitation in the esteem

of the world” and as a restoration of “our old reputation.” 60 In short, what
determined the new imperialism in the case of Abyssinia was the convergence of
peripheral crisis and the changed socioeconomic situation. The socioeconomic
situation made jingoism and imperialism more attractive; political elites could
gain electoral advantage by playing “the empire card.” 61
This was the process propelling many of Britain’s other militaristic ventures
too. Various military campaigns after the Abyssinian invasion carried with
them bouts of popular enthusiasm and jingoism (e.g., the Ashanti campaign
of 1874 and the Boer War in 1899). 62 In some cases, political elites made
straightforward calculations about how interventions abroad might serve as
an electoral tactic. In 1885, for example, the new secretary of state for India,
Lord Randolph Churchill, suggested that a strong response to French advances
in Burma might prove popular with the electorate and thus help Salisbury’s
minority Conservative administration. 63 The new discourse of empire that pro-
liferated at this time therefore makes sense. The “British Empire” and “Our
Empire” became signs under which various social classes (hence voters) could
proudly gather. 64 A pamphlet published in 1886, “The Strength and Weak-
ness of the British Empire: Dedicated to the Working Men of England,” tells
something of this. Written by an anonymous “Working Man,” it beseeched the
working class to become more familiar with and support the empire. It also
urged them to disavow social protest:
Working men of England. In the future you must be your own protectors; that is, you
must protect yourselves from falling into disgrace by the action of the mob at any
time. The recent riot at the west-end of London, February 8, 1886, gave you a slight
proof of what has already been told you; behind the mob comes ruin and desolation.
Genuine English working men would never behave in that manner. . . . Do your duty;
work quietly and effectively for a united Empire and a united people; and those that
come after you will bless and esteem your memory. 65
This suggests that domestic socioeconomic crises, along with the cynical manip-
ulations of opinion inspired by the socioeconomic context, help account for
the militaristic aspects of Britain’s new imperialism. Yet the domestic economic
situation can hardly account for all of Britain’s new imperialism. There were
other annexations that were not popularized. In these cases other factors were
at work.

The invasion of Egypt in 1882 is telling. As with the case of Abyssinia,
Egypt has been seen by historians as a critical turning point toward Britain’s
new imperialism and likewise as a sort of “test case” for assessing different
theories of imperialism. 66 The subsequent literature on the occupation by his-
torians reveals multiple factors at work. One was financial. British capital
had been injected into Egypt during previous years. Prime Minister Gladstone
himself had some financial stakes. Another was peripheral crisis. Although
financial interests were at stake, what made intervention even more likely than
before was the crisis brought on by social and political upheaval in the wake
of stringent financial controls on the Khedive. 67 The final factor had to do
with geopolitical threats that in turn posed economic threats. To the British
state, Egypt’s Suez Canal was vital: In the hands of a rival, it could undercut
British power in the region and even cut off links to Britain’s trade with India.
“For India,” noted Gladstone, “the Suez Canal is the connecting link between
herself and the centre of power – the centre of the moral, social and political
power of the world.” 68 Gladstone and other Whitehall officials were especially
worried about French control. The French had long had eyes on Egypt and
had financial investments there too. 69 They also worried about Russia and its
slow advance into the region. As Porter explains, “with Britain in Egypt not
only would British gain advantage over France and greater security for the
Suez Canal route to India but above all an important lever in negotiation with
the Ottoman government to contain Russian expansion into Turkey and the
eastern Mediterranean.” 70
Unlike the invasion of Abyssinia, the invasion of Egypt was a matter of global
and not just domestic concern. Like Abyssinia, however, it was driven by the
new climate of economic threat. The same could be said of other instances of
the new imperialism. In West Africa, for example, British expansion was partly
driven by geopolitical concerns, but economic competition also played a part.
The need for new markets in West Africa had been a common call among mer-
chants and manufacturers during the depression. These groups put continued
pressure on the British government to take action in Africa. They were quick to
argue that the need for new markets was especially important given the threat
of rival economic blocs forged by new tariffs. The Council of the Birmingham
Chamber of Commerce informed the Foreign Office, upon experiencing the
effects of the McKinley tariff on their exports to the United States: “[I]n view
of the successive limitation of our export trade, caused by hostile foreign tar-
iffs and the need for developing fresh markets, Her Majesty’s Government [is]
urged to maintain the sphere of British influence in Africa.” 71 These fears were

not unfounded. At the Berlin West Africa Conference of 1884–1885, countries
like France and Portugal attacked the idea of keeping African holdings open
to free trade. There had been mutual tariff discrimination between the British
Royal Niger Company and French and German possessions. 72 The Liverpool
Chamber of Commerce concluded:
In West Africa the British governments of the last decade have been outstripped by
Germany and France; the Gambia has dwindled; the Cameroons has been lost; two
foreign powers have intervened between Lagos and Gold Coast Colonies . . . the French
have spread themselves over Senegambia and the British governments have yielded the
districts of the Northern Rivers of Sierra Leone . . . the Chamber is of the opinion that
wherever in the unappropriated territories of Africa preponderance of British trade
existed, there British interests should have been secured, by proclaiming such territories
spheres of British influence. 73
These concerns led the British state to act decisively. Whereas it had been
previously content with informal control, direct British rule was now the only
alternative. “What moved a reluctant British government to act,” notes the
historian Muriel Chamberlain, “was the recognition that British trade was in
danger and that, in the last resort, the government had a duty to protect that
trade.” 74
What about Britain’s imperialism elsewhere in the world, such as Southeast
Asia or the Pacific? One factor driving British annexation of Burma in 1886
was, as in Egypt, peripheral instability brought on by informal imperialism.
Trade treaties with Prince Mindon in 1862 and 1867 opened up Burma to
British commerce and put Mindon on a path toward modernizing his country,
but it also created a myriad of local troubles. Mindon was compelled to set
high taxes on his subjects to pay for his reforms, and this coupled with other
economic contingencies left Burma in crisis in 1878. When Prince Thibaw took
power that year, after Mindon’s death, he began a campaign of anti-British
sentiment and refused to comply with prior trade treaties. He also tried to
impose state monopolies over the trade in key articles like cotton; and he sent
a delegation to France looking to obtain a new commercial treaty and replace
British influence with French influence. Britain faced a recalcitrant client.
An additional factor in Burma was economic interest. Thibaw’s attempts
to meddle in the cotton industry threatened the interests of the British firm,
the Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation (BBTC). In 1885, Thibaw accused
the BBTC of underpaying royalties and wages to local workers and demanded
repayment along with a fine in excess of 100,000 pounds. As this news and
the news of Thibaw’s deal with the French hit home, domestic opinion rallied.
British chambers of commerce sent petitions to the India Office demanding
British annexation. After Thibaw continued to refuse to resolve the BBTC

dispute, the British launched an invasion. At work, then, was not only a recal-
citrant Thibaw, but the economic and geopolitical effects of his resistance.
Pressure on the British government from financial interests was critical, as was
the thought of losing privileged access to cotton. 75 The fear of French con-
trol was also important. Not only would French control threaten to close off
Britain’s economic access, it would also threaten British India, whose economic
importance for the British economy at the time could not be ignored. 76
Finally we can turn to Fiji. The establishment of colonialism in Fiji is espe-
cially informative because, as seen, the British state had previously been reluc-
tant to add it to its empire. So what had changed? First, the cotton trade
with Fiji had become especially important after the American Civil War. The
value of the cotton trade had increased from 6,000 pounds in 1865 to 92,700
pounds by 1870. 77 Second, the trade had brought numerous white settlers,
missionaries, and foreign planters. The presence of these groups created ten-
sions with local Fijian chiefs and the local populace. Soon enough, settlers and
planters pleaded for help from the British state. When a British bishop was
murdered, settlers and planters became more insistent on British control. In
1872, after the murder, the interest of the colonial secretary, Lord Kimberley,
was finally peaked. 78 These two factors, though, needed a third. In fact, when
Lord Kimberley corresponded with Gladstone about possible Fijian annexa-
tion, Gladstone was initially cautious. 79 It was not until fears about Amer-
ica’s activities surfaced that the home government turned around. In 1872,
news of America’s treaty for Pago Pago harbor in Samoa reached London,
and this caused alarm. One of Britain’s main economic rivals was reaching
into the Pacific, dangerously close to Britain’s Australasian holdings. The fear
was heightened when rumors of a U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor circulated.
And, in 1874, the American chargé d’affaires in London, Benjamin Moran,
inquired at the Foreign Office about Britain’s intentions toward Fiji, signal-
ing that the United States might very well have its eyes on the islands. These
concerns made the issue of peripheral instability all the more unbearable, and
ultimately Britain decided to shift from informal imperialism in Fiji to direct
control. 80
In sum, although the cases discussed previously do not exhaust all of Britain’s
new imperialism, they show how the timing of Britain’s new imperialism was
not mere accident. The new imperialism occurred during Britain’s period of

See Webster (2000) for this story.
In 1906, Winston Churchill, whose father had been Secretary for India and supported the seizure
of upper Burma, wrote that fear of French control was a key motivation. The connections
between Thibaw and the French “left no room to doubt the imminence of a dominant foreign
influence . . . involving the most serious and far-reaching consequences to the Indian Empire”

Patterns of Empire
decline, because decline (and hence, by definition, enhanced economic compe-
tition abroad) created the conditions for it in the first place. It is true that some
of the forces driving new militaristic ventures or annexations were not directly
connected to decline. Political crises at home, disorder in the periphery, and
geopolitical threats – these were not the direct result of Britain’s decreasing eco-
nomic standing. But decline mattered critically in at least two respects. First,
decline was part of the cause of these other factors. As seen, political crises
were also economic crises: When the Disraeli government used the invasion of
Abyssinia as a performance of British power, the government was responding to
a broader climate of economic depression and political malaise brought on by
enhanced competition abroad. If the Disraeli government used jingoistic impe-
rialism to enhance British prestige, such a tactic was only necessary given the
threats to British prestige brought on by decline. Second, decline mattered by
making otherwise benign forces into serious threats. Surely it made peripheral
instability especially dangerous. Unless managed, peripheral disorder would
invite annexation by foreign powers. Given Britain’s already ailing economic
situation, this was unacceptable. Rival powers’ enhanced military capabilities
and/or new territorial annexations threatened not just British security but also
future economic opportunities – opportunities that Britain could not afford
to miss given its economic dilemmas. In other words, hegemonic decline cul-
tivated a wider sense of fear and threat that was different from the relative
complacency of Britain’s economic heyday. Increased aggressive imperialism
was the British state’s way of trying to manage this context – a way of trying to
deal with the proliferating threats brought on by decline and competition. The
new imperialism marked a new aggression, but the new aggression was a sign
of weakness rather than of strength, a desperate act of defense against a new
climate of competition and pending doom. Was America’s new imperialism the
same?
Understanding America’s Turn
We should not jump to the conclusion that decline sparked America’s new
militarism abroad. The new threat of terrorism was surely behind some of
America’s new militarism. It was the pretext for the invasion and occupation
of Afghanistan and various missile strikes and air bombardments in North
Africa (e.g., Libya, the Sudan). And terrorist acts against the United States do
not seem directly connected to American decline. Still, there are good reasons to
think that more was going on. First, the various acts of terror that invited mili-
taristic responses were not entirely contingent. The multiple terrorist incidents
since the 1970s (beginning with the Iranian hostage crisis) can be understood
within a larger historical context. As some have argued, they can be seen as
“blowback”: reactions and resistances to America’s global power. They mani-
fest peripheral disorder brought about by the logics of America’s own informal
empire. One recent study, for example, shows that transnational terrorism rose
during the 1970s and continued to rise through the 1980s and 1990s – exactlyWeary Titans

in the wake of America’s informal imperial interventions. 81 Second, and more
important, America’s new imperialism was not only about responding to ter-
rorism. Many of America’s militaristic ventures – from Panama in 1989 to Iraq
in 1991, or Bosnia and Haiti in the 1990s – were not responses to terrorist
threats. This suggests that understanding America’s new imperialism demands
an examination of more than terrorism.
Nutmeg and Prestige
Examine first America’s counterpart to Britain’s invasion of Abyssinia in 1867:
the invasion of Grenada in 1983. This was the beginning of America’s new
imperialism, just as Abyssinia was for Britain. In the case of Grenada, clearly
terrorism was not the driving force of this invasion. The official line of the
Reagan administration was that the invasion was necessary for protecting the
lives of American students and citizens in the country amidst internal disorder.
The other reason was to stamp out Communism: The Marxist-Leninist New
Jewel Movement, or NJM, had seized power. Other factors, however, were
at work besides these. One has to do with economic decline, more specifically
as it was felt in the form of rising unemployment and a falling profit rate in
key sectors of the American economy since the mid-1970s. To deal with this
situation, the Reagan administration sought ways to increase profitability. One
was military build-up. By the end of the decade, about $300 billion had gone to
the military; the profit rate on defense contracts outran profitability in durable
goods manufacturing. 82 The other tactic was deregulation. This had begun
already under President Jimmy Carter, but Reagan took it to new heights. The
final tactic was to look abroad and increase foreign investment. The Reagan
administration hoped to find new outlets abroad for American capital, and one
part of the strategy was aimed at the Caribbean. In 1982, the year before the
Grenada invasion, the Reagan administration announced the Caribbean Basin
Initiative (CBI), which was aimed at providing aid and liberalizing the region.
The invasion of Grenada must be situated within this larger economic scene.
Reagan’s strategy of military build-up needed justification. Dov S. Zakheim,
an official in the Department of Defense, explained the invasion as important
for that reason exactly. It helped signal “a major step toward recovery from
the Vietnam syndrome” and thereby served as a counterpart to Congress’s
insistence on reducing the military budget. 83 Furthermore, the threat of Com-
munism (with Cuba nearby and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua) was not only a
geopolitical matter but also an economic one. It posed a potential challenge
to Reagan’s regional liberalization strategy. If Communist regimes like NJM
spread, fields for America investment would contract. Fittingly, soon after the
invasion, the U.S. Agency for International Development reported that Grenada
was “ripe for investors.” U.S. aid to the country resumed and foreign capital

Patterns of Empire
flooded the country. 84 Reagan visited Grenada in 1986, using it as a platform to
announce a policy of enlarging the CBI and increasing investment by American
firms in apparel industries across the region. 85
Beyond economics, there was another issue. In 1983, Reagan publicly stated
that “it isn’t nutmeg that’s at stake in the Caribbean and Central America;
it is the United States’ national security.” 86 Presumably this meant that the
Communist threat was the fundamental cause of the invasion, but in reality
there was more to it. For the USSR, Grenada was but a “raindrop in the
swimming pool.” 87 The real issue was not the USSR specifically, but American
strength in the world more generally. Vietnam had been lost seven years earlier.
The Iranian hostage crisis still haunted Washington, DC. And just two days
before Reagan made the decision to send troops to Grenada, he had received
news of the Lebanon truck bombing that killed hundreds of U.S. Marines and
additional French servicemen. The United States appeared to be weakening in
strength. Combined with the economic problems and America’s larger decline
relative to other industrialized countries, the United States as a world power
and leader was put into question.
The assault on Grenada followed from these combined economic and geopo-
litical pressures. Not only did the invasion and ouster of the NJM facilitate the
Reagan administration’s broader regional strategy for reinvigorating Amer-
ican capital (and justifying the military budget), it was also a strategy for
restoring America’s prestige amidst its putative decline. Officials in the Rea-
gan administration were reported as stating that “the Reagan Administration’s
overriding reason for invading Grenada was to keep the US from being per-
ceived as a ‘paper tiger’ in the eyes of both friendly and hostile Latin Amer-
ican nations.” One senior official said, “if we said no [to the invasion], not
only might there have been another Iran with the American students . . . but
no one would have taken us seriously any more down there.” 88 Vice Pres-
ident George Bush bragged at the Republican national convention in 1984:
“Because President Reagan stood firm in defense of freedom [in Grenada],
America has regained respect throughout the world.” 89 Later commentaries
and stories confirm these claims. Richard Haas, who would later serve under
then Vice President George H. W. Bush, admitted that the invasion was not just
about stopping Communism, but also “to show that the United States could
still act effectively in the world in the aftermath of the Beirut debacle.” 90 The
invasion was also popular domestically: All polls showed that Reagan’s pop-
ularity increased after the invasion. 91 In these ways, the invasion of Grenada

was similar to Britain’s invasion of Abyssinia not just because it marked the
beginning of a resurgent imperialism, but also because the forces animating the
invasion were systematically connected to economic decline.
Decline, the New Geopolitics, and Peripheral Instability
What about the other instances of America’s new imperialism? It helps to begin
by elaborating on the situation the United States faced amidst its economic
decline. As noted, one aspect of the new context was global economic competi-
tion. The United States saw rising competition from emerging economic rivals:
first Germany and Japan; by the 1990s the EU; and China by the very end
of the century. But beyond this – and related to it – were other developments
constituting a climate not unlike the one faced by Britain a century earlier. One
development was new geopolitical competition. First, in the face of decline,
America’s relations with Western Europe took on a new tone. America’s eco-
nomic competitiveness was challenged by Europe’s economic growth, but the
end of the Cold War made the issue more challenging. The Cold War had
provided the United States with significant political leverage over Europe. It
had given justification for America’s military power and economic hegemony,
and served as the basis for a “social compact” between the United States and
the European capitalist states. The United States delivered peace and security
in exchange for European deference. 92 The end of the Cold War upended that
justification and hence America’s “crucial lever for hegemony.” 93 In addition,
the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, which turned the European Economic Com-
munity (EEC) into the European Union, not only mounted a further economic
challenge (by creating a common market and currency), but also a political
challenge. It created new institutions like the Council of Ministers and the
European Commission that could advance common security and foreign pol-
icy frameworks across Europe, potentially against America’s interests. At the
same time, Germany and France announced a plan to form an all-European
military corps.
That these events posed a potential threat to America’s interest is seen clearly
in the thinking of American defense planners and policy advisors. As early as
1991, National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft complained about the meet-
ings among Western European countries prefiguring the EU. He was concerned
that they were discussing security issues without American participation. 94 Sim-
ilarly, in response to the Franco-German Eurocorps, Bush administration offi-
cials feared that it “undercut the whole American raison d’être in Europe.” 95
92

Hence “continental Europe generally followed wherever America led. And it did so because
America’s nuclear shield and America’s promotion of global economic expansion enabled it to
deliver on its promissory notes of peace and prosperity to a continent that had known neither
for four decades.” McCormick (2004), p. 77. See also Lundestad (1986) and Layne (2006),
pp. 107–9.

Patterns of Empire
A secret Pentagon report in 1992 stated that the United States “must account
sufficiently for the interests of the advanced industrial nations to discourage
them from seeking to overturn the established political and economic order,”
and thus should “maintain the mechanism for deterring potential competitors
from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role.” It identified “Western
Europe” as one such competitor, stressing that it has “resources . . . sufficient to
generate global power.” Therefore, the report concluded, it “is of fundamental
importance to preserve NATO as the primary instrument of Western defense
and security” and “prevent the emergence of European-only security arrange-
ments which would undermine NATO.” 96 The fear was echoed throughout
Washington. The creation of the EU and its integration of national powers
threatened the United States just as, more than one hundred years earlier,
America’s own post–Civil War union and German and Italian reunification
had posed a threat to Britain. 97
The question of Western Europe was also tied to the rising threat of Russia
and the place of both within the larger question of “Eurasia.” As the Cold War
ended, the American foreign policy establishment conjured frightful images of
a new imperial Russia. Fretting over scenarios painted by Mackinder’s tra-
ditional “heartland” theory, they worried about Russia’s geographic position
next to vast natural energy reserves and its thousands of nuclear warheads.
Strategists at the Naval War College thus stressed that the main geopolitical
imperative in the post–Cold War world was to prevent “the rise of a hege-
mon capable of dominating the Eurasian continental realm and of challenging
the United States in the maritime realm.” 98 The 1992 Department of Defense
plan warned that Russia retains “the most military potential in all of Eura-
sia.” Russia will “remain the strongest military power in Eurasia and the only
power in the world with the capability of destroying the United States.” 99
Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1997 added that “America’s global primacy is directly
dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the Eurasian
continent is sustained”; but that preponderance on the Eurasian continent
was also dependent on American power in Europe. 100 “The United States’
ability to project influence and power in Eurasia relies on close transatlantic
ties.” 101
The other development lay in the periphery. The 1970s and 1980s not
only marked the beginnings of American decline. These were also years when
America’s preceding informal empire and the attendant geopolitical structure
began to show signs of fissure. The issue extended beyond barbarians at the
gate. It was about the breakdown of America’s client regimes. Popular protests

and mass movements threatened to unseat American-supported dictators, from
Duvalier in Haiti to Marcos in the Philippines. This was partially concomitant
with the “third wave” of democratization beginning in the 1970s and carrying
through the 1980s. Democratization in part implied a potential breakdown
in American-supported authoritarian regimes. 102 The overall slowdown of the
global economy in the 1970s and the subsequent debt crisis in the 1980s did
not make things any easier. Around the globe, the ideology of postcolonial
“developmentalism” fell apart, as so-called developing countries saw internal
disorder and declining standards of living. The relative stability created by
America’s informal empire “gave way to disintegrating order, simmering dis-
contents, and unchanneled radical temperaments.” 103 The Middle East was
one such site where unruly forces were unleashed. The late 1970s and 1980s
saw the Iranian revolution and the seizure of American hostages in Iran, PLO
terrorism and the Lebanon War, and the Iraq-Iran War.
America’s economic activities abroad laid down the conditions for further
peripheral problems. In the midst of falling profit rates at home, American busi-
nesses and the political elite increasingly looked abroad. The American state
sought to facilitate investment through new trade agreements in the region –
often as defensive moves against European and Asian trading blocs – such as
the Caribbean Basin Initiative (which was expanded into the U.S.-Caribbean
Basin Trade Partnership Act) and the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement in
1988 (a prelude to NAFTA in 1994). 104 It also pushed countries in the Global
South to liberalize their economies, encouraging structural adjustment pro-
grams that would open up fresh fields for investment. 105 Fittingly, the amount
of American foreign direct investment abroad since the 1980s grew dramat-
ically and continued through the 1990s (see Table 5.1). This growth in U.S.
foreign investment was similar to Britain’s increasing turn to foreign investment
in the late nineteenth century when Britain also underwent economic decline.
The end of the Cold War raised even more possibilities for peripheral insta-
bility. When combined with the breakdown of developmentalism and the debt
crises of the 1980s, the discipline over peripheral regimes became undone,
and former clients were invited to be more recalcitrant to superpower dictates
than before. The break-up of the Soviet Union itself posed trouble, unleashing
nationalist sentiments, secessionism, and “long pent-up centrifugal forces.” 106
By 1997, the Central Intelligence Agency’s National Intelligence Council was
worrying about the potential for nationalist revolutionary forces in the new
Russia that might take power and work against U.S. interests. Its report also
noted instability all around the world. It warned that “most conflicts today are
internal, not between states” and that “this tendency will continue.” The report

astutely worried that with such conflict and breakdown comes the “potential
for outside intervention.” 107
The context of American decline was thus very similar to that in which
Britain began its descent. Economic decline carried periods of downturn at
home, but it also meant global economic competition and the added threat of
alternative economic and political regional centers. And as America’s economic
hegemony began to wither, so too did the geopolitical order that American
informal empire had helped to create and tried to contain. It is in this context
that the United States stepped up its imperialistic activity, not only in Grenada,
but elsewhere.
From Panama to the Balkans
To see this more clearly, consider the 1989 Panama invasion. The invasion,
or “Operation Just Cause,” was ostensibly precipitated by Gen. Manuel Nor-
iega’s illicit activities and his harassment of American soldiers. But Noriega
had long been a close ally of American agencies. He had worked with the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA), had allies in the Department of Defense
(DOD), and had been on the CIA payroll. 108 When he had abused his power,
Washington had typically turned a blind eye. 109 But things got out of control.
Beginning in the mid-1980s, Noriega heightened his repression of dissidents,
thereby inciting popular protests across the country and a massive demonstra-
tion of 100,000 people in Panama City. He was also indicted for racketeering,
drug trafficking, and money laundering – activities that did not have the Reagan
administration’s consent.

As Noriega continued to prove intransigent to American designs, he posed
international trouble. 110 With the Soviet Union crumbling, the question of
America’s future status as a sole superpower capable of imposing a new dis-
cipline on the international system was being raised. As one expert put it, “If
the United States could not handle a low-level dictator in a country where it
maintained bases and large forces, how would it be able to deal with far more
serious international challenges?” 111 The invasion of Panama, with its over-
whelming use of force, was thus like the invasion of Grenada, however in a
post–Cold War context. The power of the American military was summoned
not only to deal with a resistant client, but also to help demonstrate America’s
power in a perilously changing world.
Even the use of American military force to reinstall Aristide in Haiti in
1994 can be understood within the context of hegemonic decline. On the
one hand, the reinstallation was predicated on a breakdown of clientelism.
The clientelistic relationship had plagued successive American administrations
ever since the second Duvalierian regime (of Jean-Claude Duvalier, or “Baby
Doc”) began to crumble under the weight of domestic instability and popular
protest. Aristide rode that wave of populism, but his fiery leftist and anti-
U.S. rhetoric did not win him friends in Washington. The American-supported
elections in 1990 were a pragmatic compromise: The Bush administration
hoped that elections would subdue social disorder and elevate former World
Bank official Marc Bazin into office, thereby replacing one client (Duvalier) with
another (Bazin). However, Aristide’s victory took Washington by surprise. The
CIA waged a covert campaign to discredit him, while the Bush administration
gave de facto support to the bloody coup led by General Raoul Cédras. 112
What followed was yet more popular protest, violent repression of pro-Aristide
forces, and widespread international attention, as well as a refugee problem
produced by the crisis. The Clinton administration was finally pressed to adopt
a strategy of reinstalling Aristide while nonetheless aiming to discipline him
and make him a more amenable client.
Although peripheral instability played a part in the installation of Aristide,
America’s economic interests played a role as well. One of the reasons why
the United States took such an interest in the internal affairs of Haiti in the
first place was that Haiti had been a critical site for the post-1970s strategy of
exporting capital to manage falling profitability at home. The Caribbean Basin
Initiative touted Haiti as one of its models. 113 Clinton’s decision to send troops
to Haiti was made in the same year that it announced plans to build on the
CBI by extending NAFTA to the whole hemisphere (through the Free Trade
of the Americas initiative). These plans, deemed by strategists as critical for
managing hegemonic decline, were threatened by unrest and political disorder

in Haiti. “If the international and hemispheric community allows thugs such
as Raul Cedras, Michel Francois, and Phillipe Biamby to continue to rob and
terrorize the people of Haiti,” stated Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott,
“that country is likely to become a haven and a breeding ground for the forces
of instability and criminality in the region.” 114
Aristide had to return to power lest America’s economic plans were unrav-
eled. Upon announcing his plan to end the embargo against Haiti, Clinton
declared: “I want to do more than lift the embargo; I want to help rebuild the
economy of Haiti. That would be good for America.” 115 The president of Inter-
national Industrial Exporters, Inc., a major transnational corporation dealing
in contracting in Haiti, explained his support of Clinton’s plan to restore Aris-
tide to power as follows: “Mr. Aristide isn’t any more the answer to Haiti’s
problems than is the military. But his return to power is worth the cost of the
U.S. military incursion if it fosters a resumption of free trade and the sale of
U.S. goods and services.” 116 It followed that the reinstallation of Aristide by
the hand of the American military came with a host of stringent conditions,
including a new structural adjustment program. 117 Financial aid would help
secure Aristide as a client. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was
unabashed: “Even after our exit in February 1996 we will remain in charge
by means of the USAID and the private sector.” 118 In turn, Aristide would
restore stability and help the American state try to realize its regional strategy
for managing its economic woes.
Whereas Haiti and Panama were within America’s traditional sphere of
influence, the Balkans were not. What explains America’s successive interven-
tions there in the 1990s? Peripheral instability was the spark. The integrity of
Yugoslavia had been maintained by both the United States and the USSR, but
the end of the Cold War unleashed intra-Yugoslavian conflict. This in itself
solicited interest from the big powers. But if local disorder was the spark,
geopolitical concerns in the context of decline fanned the flames. The reason
why intervention in Yugoslavia was so important to the United States, and
why it took the form of U.S.-led NATO operations, had to do with America’s
relationship with the European Union.
As noted, the Cold War had provided the United States with its primary
justification for its military presence in Europe in the form of NATO, and
hence for Europe’s dependence on the United States, but the end of the Cold
War threatened to unsettle this dependent relationship. Why should Europe
depend on the United States if the Communist threat had been effectively
tamed? Why should Europe continue with the NATO alliance? Why not form

a new European-based security apparatus outside the control of the American
state? These questions plagued planners and policy makers in Washington in
the early 1990s. Rightfully so. An end to American-controlled NATO would
spell the end of American political hegemony in the region and enable new
political-economic rivals to consolidate, grow, and expand. This was all the
more terrifying given the increasing economic weight of the European Union,
Russia, and China (which might ally with Russia). 119 Accordingly, a Pentagon
paper in 1992 had declared that “Our strategy [after the fall of the Soviet
Union] must refocus on precluding the emergence of any potential future global
competitor.” 120 As Western Europe was deemed by many in Washington as one
such possible competitor from the Eurasia region, the continuance of NATO
was critical. “A new Europe is still taking shape,” Brzezinski stressed, “and
if that Europe is to remain part of the ‘Euro-Atlantic’ space, the expansion
of NATO is essential.” 121 The real trick was to keep NATO intact while also
ensuring U.S. control over it. 122
The decision to intervene in Bosnia and the subsequent campaigns in the
latter part of the decade followed from these considerations. Before the first
campaign, Air Force Chief of Staff General Michael J. Dugan wrote in the New
York Times that a “win in the Balkans would establish U.S. leadership in the
post-Cold War world in a way that Operation Desert Storm never could.” 123
In 1997, after the first 1995 campaign (but before the 1999 Kosovo operation),
a document circulating in the CIA stated that the first intervention had created
the exact outcome pinpointed by Dugan: “European publics will continue to
support the US military presence in Europe, partly as a hedge against Russia and
renationalization of defenses, and as a result of NATO’s entry into the Bosnia
imbroglio – a step that reaffirmed the effectiveness of the Alliance in managing
post-Cold war crises. Europeans will not find anything sacrosanct about the
number of US forces stationed in their countries – their views of American
leadership will be determined less by the size of the American presence than by
the use of these forces for combined operations.” 124 As former Colonel Andrew
Bacevich eloquently concludes, it is clear that Operation Allied Force “was
neither planned nor conducted to alleviate the plight of the Kosovars. . . . The
intent . . . was to provide an object lesson to any European state fancying that
it was exempt from the rules of the post–Cold War era. It was not Kosovo
that counted, but affirming the dominant position of the United States” in
Europe. 125
Hitched to these concerns were direct economic interests. Europe had been
a vital site for American exports. As Secretary of State Warren Christopher

stressed in 1995, “all told, Europe accounts for almost half of the foreign rev-
enues of American firms. Our investment in Europe alone roughly equals that
in the rest of the world put together.” 126 A loss of standing in Europe, con-
tinued instability in the region, or the formation of a rival trading bloc would
be disastrous for the American economy. Former director of the NSA William
Odum warned in 1992 that “failure to act effectively in Yugoslavia will not only
affect US security interests but also US economic interests. Our economic inter-
dependency with Western Europe creates large numbers of American jobs.” 127
Stability in Europe was necessary for maintaining the profitability of Ameri-
can capital amidst the threat of economic decline; ending the Bosnia crisis was
necessary for that stability. 128 Just before the bombing campaign in Kosovo
in 1999, President Clinton said so. He told an audience of local government
employees of the AFL-CIO: “[I]f we’re going to have a strong economic rela-
tionship that includes our ability to sell around the world, Europe has got to
be a key. . . . That’s what this Kosovo thing is all about.” 129 Senator Richard
Lugar (R-Indiana) hit the nail on the head. He said he supported intervention
in Bosnia because “there will be devastating economic effects in Europe of a
spread of war and, thus, the loss of jobs in this country as we try to base a
recovery upon our export potential.’” 130
America’s approach to the African continent offers an informative contrast.
As Andrew Bacevich points out, Africa saw instability and disorder through-
out this period, just like the Balkans, Central America, and the Caribbean. Yet
U.S. intervention there involved small deployments (Somalia) or missile strikes
(against the Al Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum in response to the ter-
rorist bombing of U.S. diplomatic missions in Tanzania and Kenya). 131 These
deployments did not involve the same amount of military power deployed in
Panama, Haiti, or the Balkans. Nor did they necessitate continued visits. The
crisis in Haiti conjured American deployments not only in 1994 but also in
2004. The Balkans called for two major interventions in the 1990s. America’s
hand in Africa, however, was minimal. Why? The answer is that Africa was not
important in the context of American decline. Although certain raw materials
had been seen as essential for America’s economic base in the mid-twentieth
century, many of those raw materials had lost their vitality as alternative tech-
nologies and new industries emerged. Unlike Europe or the south of the West-
ern hemisphere, therefore, it was not part of the American state’s plan for
economic recovery amidst America’s economic fall. The Clinton administra-
tion had hoped that, one day, the African continent and its “700 million

consumers” might serve as a fruitful field for American products, but the fact
remained that the entire continent only made for 1 percent of total U.S. trade in
the 1990s. Whereas U.S. direct investment in Europe reached $389,378 million
and in Latin America $155,925 million in 1996, it was a mere $8,162 million
in Africa. 132 Given these figures, it should not be surprising that instability in
Africa warranted minimal concern.
Iraq in Context
We can now put Iraq into a new light. Like the foregoing cases, American
intervention in Iraq was the result of a conjunction of factors particular to the
context of decline. The first factor was peripheral instability brought on by
the logics of informal imperialism. Before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait,
he had been a client of the United States. After Iraq and Iran had begun
their war in 1980, the Reagan administration decided to enlist Hussein as
an ally. The United States sent financial aid, agricultural exports, and military
intelligence. Reagan also sent a presidential envoy (Donald Rumsfeld, then head
of a major multinational pharmaceutical firm) to consult with Hussein and his
regime. 133 Iran conceded defeat in 1988 and American support continued.
Until at least 1990, U.S. firms sold aircraft to the regime; the U.S. government
approved licenses for American firms to sell biological products and electronics
equipment to Iraqi missile-producing plants; and under George H. W. Bush
agricultural credits to Iraq were doubled to $1 billion a year. 134 Yet Hussein
overstepped his bounds by invading Kuwait. In part, the logics of clientelism
help explain the action: Hussein had previously sent “feelers” to the Bush
administration to get a sense of how the United States would respond to an
invasion. The responses were ambiguous. Although Secretary of Defense Dick
Cheney responded that the United States would not take kindly to an invasion
of Kuwait, the U.S. State Department and the U.S. ambassador implied that
the United States would not take an opposed stance. 135 In any case, Hussein
did invade Kuwait, and this created a scenario that called for some kind of U.S.
action.
The reasons why the action took the form of a massive military strike are
twofold. The first has to do with oil. This might be obvious, but it was not so
simple as U.S. oil interests hoping to tap Kuwait. Rather, the threat was that
Iraq might monopolize oil reserves in the Gulf. Washington feared that Iraq, by
taking Kuwait, would not only have its own oil and Kuwaiti oil but also Saudi
Arabia’s oil. In such an event, Iraq would control a majority of the region’s oil
reserves. This was the frightful scenario of a single “oil hegemon”; to the power
establishment in Washington, it was simply impermissible. 136 The possibility

Patterns of Empire
seemed real to U.S. officials. It is now known that the United States had made
contingency plans to invade the Middle East as a result of the oil embargo of
1973. 137 The invasion of Kuwait appeared to be a similar contingency. Richard
Haas, who received a Presidential Medal for his role in developing the invasion
plan (he was the Special Assistant to Bush the Elder and National Security
Council Senior Director for Near East and South Asian Affairs), thought so for
sure. He said that the invasion of Kuwait raised fears in the administration that
“Iraq was preparing to invade Saudi Arabia. Even if not, it was thought that an
Iraq that controlled Kuwait could intimidate Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf
states – and as a result dominate the world’s energy markets.” Therefore, an
overriding objective of the invasion was to maintain “the security and stability
of Saudi Arabia and the entire Gulf region.” Among the more “immediate
concerns” guiding the invasion, he said, were “energy interests and the well-
being of America’s traditional friends in the Middle East.” 138
There is, however, a final factor. This helps explain not only the decision
to use force but also the fact that the use of force was so overwhelming –
the largest deployment in the Middle East perhaps since World War II: that
is, a symbolic display to maintain America’s global position amidst potential
charges of decline. In part, the display was a signal to Europe that it still
needed American patronage. According to the historian Thomas McCormick,
the 1991 invasion was not just an attack on Iraq but simultaneously a de
facto policy toward Europe. It was a “‘resource war’ to remind Europe that
it still needed America to maintain access to global raw materials in a post–
Cold War world.” The subsequent air strikes under Clinton served a similar
function, acting “as a continuing reminder to EU nations (and Japan) that
they still needed American protection to maintain the stability of the Persian
Gulf region and its oil production, on which they depended.” 139 At the same
time, the war was a signal to American publics and the world more generally
that the United States was not in fact in decline, that its military power could
effectively maintain America’s dominance, and that countries like Germany and
Japan would not be able to overtake America. Casting out Saddam Hussein’s
army from Kuwait would “showcase the capabilities and competence of the
US military”; it would not only justify the military build-up of the preceding
decade, but also “demonstrate the utility of American military power, now
outside the context of the Cold War.” According to Colonel Bacevich, who
was posted in the Gulf, “this would validate America’s continuing capacity to
exercise global leadership – thereby giving lie to the forecasts, then much in
fashion, that the United States faced imminent decline, its standing soon to be
eclipsed by economic powerhouses like Japan or a just-reunified Germany.” 140

Bush began speaking of a “new world order”: a world order that was to depend
on America’s leadership and patronage. If the United States could not dominate
economically, at least it could dominate militarily.
The subsequent invasion of Iraq in 2003 in the wake of September 11
revealed the fissures of that new world order. It is already clear that terrorism
and the threat of weapons of mass destruction were pretexts at best. At issue
was control over oil. Oil had been at issue in 1991 too, but now the threat of
a rival oil hegemon was even more frightening. For one thing, given that the
September 11 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia, the United States faced the
threat of having to eventually terminate its relations with its long-standing oil
client. For another, the rapid rise of China had finally put it on Washington’s
list of potential alternative power centers. Already in 2000, the chairman of
the National Intelligence Council declared: “[T]he real question, then, is not
whether China will be a major regional power, but rather how big a power
it will be and, more importantly, how China will use its power.” 141 Later, in
2003, the year the U.S. invasion of Iraq was unleashed, the Council on Foreign
Relations tried to downplay China’s capabilities, asserting that it was decades
behind the United States in terms of military power. But by then China’s eco-
nomic growth had already fanned fears among officials in Bush the Younger’s
administration of the rise of a Eurasian superpower capable of overtaking the
United States once and for all. 142 And the Institute for International Economics,
which had on its board prominent economic strategists like Paul Volcker and
Larry Summers, warned of an “East Asian economic bloc that could create
a tripolar world economy, with significant geopolitical as well as economic
implications for the United States.” 143
These economic and strategic concerns regarding China were only further
fueled by Russia’s “strategic relationship” – as the National Intelligence Coun-
cil called it – with China, which included the sale of Russian technology and
weapons. Attendant with this fear was Russia’s own bid for regional power,
manifested in part by its continual attempts to gain oil and natural gas from
the Caspian region. 144 Even the Economist magazine took note, warning in
1999 that China and Russia would work together to gain preferential con-
trol over the energy-rich Caspian Sea basin. The following year, in 2000, a
National Intelligence Council report forecasted possible global scenarios that
could unfold by 2015. One of them was that “China, India, and Russia form a
defacto geo-strategic alliance in an attempt to counterbalance U.S. and Western
influence.” 145
Many scholars across the political spectrum have argued that the Iraq inva-
sion was motivated in light of these Eurasian economic and political threats.

David Harvey (2003) notes that a permanent U.S. presence in Iraq would pro-
vide a new site for controlling oil that, in turn, would provide the United States
with “a powerful U.S. military bridgehead on the Eurasian land mass.” This
would give the United States a “powerful geostrategic position in Eurasia with
at least the potentiality to disrupt any consolidation of a Eurasian power.” 146
The Chinese economy, after all, depends on foreign oil. Any future Chinese mil-
itary force would also depend on foreign oil. In The American Conservative,
Anthony Layne thus argues:
The real reason the administration went to war had nothing to do with terrorism. . . . The
administration went to war in Iraq to consolidate America’s global hegemony and
to extend U.S. dominance to the Middle East by establishing a permanent military
stronghold in Iraq for the purposes of controlling the Middle Eastern oil spigot (thereby
giving Washington enormous leverage in its relations with Western Europe and China);
allowing Washington to distance itself from an increasingly unreliable and unstable
Saudi Arabia; and using the shadow of U.S. military power to bring about additional
regime changes in Iran and Syria.
Without access to administration documents, it is difficult to conclusively assess
these arguments. Yet the facts already available speak volumes. The first is
that, before the 2003 invasion, policy makers with experience in the Gulf were
already forecasting the need for future American intervention. Richard Haas
wrote in 1999 that the use of American military force was imminent because
“vital U.S. interests would suffer sharply were the Persian Gulf to fall under the
sway of a hostile Iran or Iraq.” 147 The second is that Iraq’s oil reserves, thought
to be the second largest in the world, amount to five times the total in the United
States and remain the least explored of the world’s oil-rich areas. Only two
thousand wells have been drilled in Iraq, whereas a million have been drilled
in Texas alone. 148 The third is that, despite all talk of a temporary occupation,
after the invasion the United States initiated the construction of massive military
bases in Iraq that the Pentagon referred to as “enduring bases.” By 2007, at
least five self-sufficient bases were under way. One of them, reported in the
Washington Post, is the Balad Air Base, which has a miniature golf course, a
cinema, a football field, and a neighborhood called “KBR-land,” named after
a Halliburton subsidiary. All of the bases have been built far away from major
urban centers but close enough to have “power projection capacity,” that is,
potentially capable of hitting regional targets outside Iraq. 149 Fourth, the Bush
administration pushed the Iraqi government to pass a new law for dealing with
the distribution of oil revenues. The U.S. version of such a law ceded nearly
all the oil to Western companies, making it the most open to foreign control

compared with the nationalized controls exercised by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
and Iran. 150
There are thus parallels and precursors. In more than one sense, America’s
military deployments in the Middle East at the turn of the twenty-first century
replayed the scramble for Africa one hundred years earlier. They were part of a
wider struggle to control raw materials vital for the world economy. The only
difference is that whereas Africa had been the site of much of Britain’s new
imperialism in the late nineteenth century, one hundred years later the strategic
site of concern had shifted to other regions – in this case the Middle East. But
beyond this difference the overarching similarity remains. Both Britain’s and
America’s new imperialisms were unleashed during the two states’ period of
decline and heightened global competition because, in several respects, they
were responses to decline and heightened competition. They do not represent
the work of powerful empires flexing their muscles, but rather ailing hegemons
tactically trying to ward off impending doom. Rather than feats of strength,
they are acts of desperation amidst the threat of final demise.

In 1879, the British sociologist Herbert Spencer wrote to liberal parliamentar-
ian and free trader John Bright. Urging him to support a new Anti-Aggression
League, Spencer bemoaned the “aggressive tendencies displayed by us all over
the world – picking quarrels with native races and taking possession of their
land.” 1 Decades later V. I. Lenin referred to a similar process. He spoke of the
“tremendous ‘boom’ in colonial conquests” by the British state that had begun
in the late nineteenth century. 2 Of course, Spencer and Lenin were speaking of
Britain’s “new imperialism,” about which we already know. Occurring in the
context of Britain’s economic decline, it marked a new aggression on the part
of the British state. We also know about the American counterpart to this. In
the 1980s, in the context of its own economic decline, the American state too
embarked on a new path of direct imperialism. Both states shifted their imperial
modalities and intensity; they become more bold, direct, and aggressive.
However, the fact that both the British and American states embarked on
new imperialisms should not be the end of our story. It merely invites us to con-
sider larger historical dynamics. The fact that both states initiated new imperi-
alisms intimates the possibility of older imperialisms. It suggests the possibility
of imperial shifts or transformations over longer periods of time. It intimates
a story about imperial states sometimes becoming more violent and bold and
sometimes more restrained and less direct. The new imperialisms might just be
fragments of a larger pattern of imperial expansion and contraction, relative
stability and renewed assertion, and imperial stagnation and growth.

This chapter explores such imperial shifts over time. Whereas previous chap-
ters have looked at specific phases or moments in the two empires’ histories,
this chapter looks at the bigger picture. It illuminates overarching patterns,
processes, and dynamics over the course of the two states’ modern imperial
histories. It locates a historical structure to imperialism. Since the fall of the
Rome, it has become a cliché to speak roundly about the rise, decline, and fall
of empires. This chapter does something different: It speaks about the ups and
downs of imperialistic aggression.
The Phases of Empire
In previous chapters, we have seen the British and American empires’ respec-
tive ascendancies to global power, their colonial policies and regimes, their
preferred modalities of imperialism during their respective hegemonic phases,
and their new imperialisms during their periods of decline. If we put these
discrete stories together into a larger whole, however, we can induce a
larger historical pattern. The pattern consists of three phases: imperial expan-
sion, abatement, and reassertion. These phases roughly correspond with
the two states’ phases of ascendancy, hegemonic maturity, and decline (see
Table 6.1).
To elaborate: The first phase occurred as the British and American states
ascended toward global economic dominance. As seen in Chapter 1, during
this period the two states’ respective paths to global preeminence were paved
by youthful imperial aggression. This aggression took the form of bold terri-
torial conquests and military power to secure the conquests, expand trading
networks, and protect borders. Britain expanded in the Americas and then
into parts of Africa and Asia. Similarly, the United States reached westward
in the Americas and took possessions in the Caribbean and the Asia-Pacific.
The next phase of the sequence occurred during the two states’ periods of208
Patterns of Empire
hegemonic maturity. As seen in Chapter 3, in this phase, the two states’ terri-
torial expansion slowed if not stagnated entirely, and they resorted to informal
imperialism. Rather than continuing to conquer colonies, both states preferred
to cultivate clients. For instance, just as the British state preferred to estab-
lish allied sovereign dependencies in Latin America rather than ruling them
as colonies, so did the United States cultivate its covert machinery to silently
topple regimes rather than invade them. In short, as the two hegemons reaped
the fruits of economic dominance in the world, both states opted for indirect
means of exercising influence.
The final phase occurred during the two states’ respective periods of hege-
monic decline. In this phase, both states reasserted themselves in the world
with new vigor. Facing increasing competition from rivals and new economic
troubles, the British and American states became more and more aggressive
in their imperial tactics. As we learned in previous chapters, the form of this
aggression differed: The British empire became more aggressive through formal
imperialism as well as militarism, whereas the U.S. empire’s reassertion took
the form of military invasion, air strikes, or temporary military occupations.
But whatever the particular form, both states became more overtly and directly
imperialistic in this period.
We can detect this overarching pattern of expansion, abatement, and reasser-
tion by looking at quantitative data. Even if they do not tell us everything,
numbers sometimes speak. The numbers here affirm the historical narrative of
preceding chapters. Consider the number of colonies seized by the British state
per year (i.e., the rate of British colonization). This offers a good indicator of
Britain’s imperial aggression: Land grabbing and direct rule are quintessentially
imperialistic. When we look at these numbers, the historical structure surfaces.
During the late eighteenth century (during Britain’s ascent phase), we see bouts
of expansion followed by a relative abatement in the mid-nineteenth century.
Then, in the late nineteenth century, during Britain’s decline, we see an upswing
(Figure 6.1). Admittedly, the first phase of imperialism should be broken up
into two peak periods: an upsurge in the 1760s and then a new and longer
wave in the 1780s. 3 Yet when taken together, they can be seen as part of a
larger single wave of imperialism; larger, that is, relative to the mid-nineteenth
century.
We may also visualize the historical dynamics of U.S. imperialism by a sim-
ilar approach, although we should be sensitive to historical context. Because
colonialism had become illegitimate for any world power in the latter half of the
twentieth century, we would not expect American imperialism to be measured
3
These two waves are separated temporally and geographically: The first wave in the 1760s
occurred largely in the Americas and the Caribbean (including the annexation of Quebec, Cape
Breton, Grenada, St. Vincent, and Tobago), whereas the second wave beginning in the 1780s
included not only territories in the Americas, but also new additions farther off in Asia and
Africa (e.g., parts of India, New South Wales, Penang, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, and the Cape
Colony).8

solely by direct colonization. Accordingly, if we wish to examine patterns of
imperialism over the longer durée of the nineteenth century through the early
twenty-first century, we should look at colonization and direct military inter-
ventions together. Although direct military intervention is not the same as
colonization, it is nonetheless more costly and overt than diplomacy, financial
aid, or other (perhaps more subtle) mechanisms of influence. Looking at both
colonization and military interventions thereby provides a window into the
historical ups and downs of U.S. imperial aggression that is more comparable
to Britain’s ups and downs. Doing so yields a complicated picture, but from it
emerges the same sequence of expansion, abatement, and reassertion (Figure
6.2). There are four peak periods or waves of heightened imperialistic aggres-
sion (marked by letters A, B, C, D). The highest point is the period around 1898
(wave C). The next major wave occurs in the late twentieth century, beginning
circa the 1980s (wave D). In between there is a low trough. The first three
waves taken together correspond with America’s period of hegemonic ascent.
The fourth and most recent wave (wave D) corresponds to America’s period
of decline. The historical pattern of British imperialism is thus reiterated in
American imperialism.
We should be more precise. We have been treating the entire historical
period up until hegemonic maturity as part of a single ascent phase, but this
is problematic. Surely we cannot consider the entire history of Britain up until
1815 as part of its ascent phase. So when does ascent begin? To address this,
we can draw on world-systems theorists and their demarcation of global cycles.
In this approach, the period of ascent officially begins when the prior hegemon
declines and the global system becomes more competitive. For instance, the
proper period of America’s ascent would begin in 1874 when the prior hegemon
(in this case, Britain) began its fall and the global field became more competitive.
For Britain’s ascent, the issue is more complicated, but we can take the year
1763 as a starting point. This is the year when Britain proved itself to be
a real contender for global power by defeating France in the Seven Years’
War. 4 Demarcating the ascent periods in this way does not alter our story:
We still see more imperialistic activity in the ascent phase than during the
maturity phase. We also see higher average annual rates of activity in these
periods of ascent and decline than during the hegemonic maturity phase (see
Tables 6.2 and 6.3).
In short, just as all empires surely rise and surely fall, so too have the two
hegemonic empires in the modern era – the American and British empires –
followed a pattern of extension, stability, and reextension. In the two states’
imperial careers there have been moments or periods when they became more
directly imperialistic, employing more direct and costly means to exert influence
in the world than in other moments or periods. Furthermore, these fluctuations

global hegemon, but does not consolidate its position until 1815. See Wallerstein (1980), p. 245;

correlate with the phases of the two states’ hegemonic careers. The two states
were less aggressive during their respective periods of hegemonic maturity than
during their periods of ascent or decline. 5
Drawing on lessons from earlier chapters, we can see that there are other
correlates to these phases. We have seen, for instance, that the phases of impe-
rialism came with certain discursive patterns. During their respective periods
of hegemony, talk of “empire” was suppressed or at least lessened in both
countries. The banner of empire was lowered only to then be raised again dur-
ing the decline phase. In fact, in the United States, talk of American empire
proliferated during both the ascent and decline phases. As the United States
constructed its overseas empire in the Caribbean and Pacific, talk of the United
States as an empire came to the fore, just as it did during the late twentieth and
into the present century as America’s “new imperialism” was unleashed amidst
America’s decline. The structure of imperial discourse over time followed the
fluctuations of imperial aggression.
U.S. and British trade policies roughly correspond with the phases of hege-
mony and imperialism too. During their respective phases of hegemonic matu-
rity, both the U.S. and British imperial states pursued similar economic policies
and espoused similar trade rhetoric at the same time that they lessened their
direct imperialism. In particular, as seen in Chapter 3, both liberalized their
trade policies and made gestures toward global free trade. For the British state,
this was reflected in the repeal of the Corn Laws and various tariff reductions
through the 1860s. For the American state, it was reflected in the General Agree-
ment on Tariffs and Trade (1947). 6 This is not to say that both states acted as
benevolent economic hegemons or that they uniformly pursued so-called free
trade in full. Many economic sectors remained under tariff protection, and the
free trade rhetoric was often performative, sometimes contradicted by hypocrit-
ical policies. It is the case nonetheless that the trade policies of both states were
more liberal than during the ascent phase. As hegemons, both states not only

Quantitative studies of the world system have suggested similar dynamics to imperialism,
although they examine the dynamics at the level of global system (rates of colonization by
all states). See Bergesen and Schoenberg (1980) and Boswell (1989).
These economic parallels, as well as main differences, are covered in O’Brien (2002). On U.S.
trade policy, see especially Chorev (2007).The Dynamics of Imperialism

preferred informal empire; they also preferred the open door to mercantilist
gates – in rhetoric at least if not in practice.
The pattern thus holds: Both the British and American states extended their
direct imperial aggression, retracted or at least stabilized it, and then reextended
it during their respective periods of decline. This invites us to wonder whether
there is some kind of deeper logic to it all. Is the pattern of imperialism expli-
cable or just accident – a miraculous coincidence? The previous chapter has
explained why the British and American states embarked on new imperialisms
during their respective phases of hegemonic decline. Yet this only accounts for
why the two states reasserted themselves during their decline phases. It does
not explain why they both became more aggressive during their ascent phases
or why their direct imperialism receded during their periods of hegemony. It is
a historically specific explanation of one moment in a larger cycle; it does not
illuminate the cycle in its entirety. The question remains: Might there be some
kind of logic governing the foregoing fluctuations of imperial aggression?
Explaining the Pattern
Surely any explanation for the American and British cycles of imperialism
would have to include a multitude of factors. Reaching across seas and over
historical eras, the pattern of imperialism might not reduce to a single explana-
tory force. If the story were to turn on any single force at all, however, it should
have to do with the structure of the global field; or more precisely, global eco-
nomic competition. We would expect this to be important because it is exactly
what differentiates the different phases of hegemonic cycles in the first place.
The concept of hegemony refers to global economic structures. The idea is that
the world system oscillates between phases of hegemonic maturity and com-
petition. The hegemonic maturity phase (or “unicentric” or “unipolar” phase)
is when one state enjoys a preponderance over the world economy. The other
phase is one of competition (or “multicentricity” or “multipolarity”); this is a
time of intense economic rivalry between states. 7 The former is a period when
there is a single hegemon; the latter is when that hegemon declines as competi-
tion arises. Facing unprecedented rivals that are capturing increasing shares of

Patterns of Empire
world output, the hegemon no longer enjoys a preponderance over the world
economy. The global field shifts from a unipolar or unicentric structure to a
multipolar or multicentric structure.
We have just seen that the British and American cycles of imperialism corre-
spond with these phases in the hegemony cycle. The two states turned to more
direct modalities of imperialism and heightened their aggression when they
faced decline; that is, when the global economic field became more competitive
and entered a multicentric phase. The same goes for their periods of ascent. As
each state rose to power, the prior hegemon was in decline and the global field
became more competitive. In that phase, each imperial state was more prone
to step up its imperial aggression. It was only during their respective phases of
hegemonic maturity when the states’ respective aggression and boldness gave
way to indirect modalities of imperial power. Put differently, it was only when
the field was less competitive and the system entered an unipolar phase that
direct imperialism waned.
The pattern can now be understood in more precise relation to competitive
structures of the global field. In brief, when economically dominant in the world
economy relative to other states – that is, when the global field was unicentric
and so competition was low – the British and American states preferred to
cultivate clients through subtle mechanisms of power rather than deploying
either colonization or overt military force. But when either state was struggling
economically against other states in a more competitive global field – that is,
when the field was multicentric – they were more willing to colonize or use
overt military force. In short, competitive structures of the global field appear
to breed direct imperial aggression. The question is why.
Competition and Multicentricity
To answer, let us turn first to Britain’s waves of imperial aggression. In Chap-
ter 5, we saw something of how competition in the global field during the late
nineteenth century pushed the British state to become bolder and more aggres-
sive. Beginning in the 1870s, Britain’s economic supremacy was challenged by
upstarts and older powers. British firms were threatened by foreign firms while
competing states like Germany, the United States, France, Italy, and Russia
introduced or reasserted new tariff systems that threatened to cut Britain out.
Some of the rivals (not least Germany and the United States) began using their
new economic muscles to build their military power. In this highly competitive
context, British firms pushed the British state to annex new territory in order
to secure routes, markets, and raw materials. The British state often responded
affirmatively, operating out of its own concerns. Fearing rivals’ military power
and the loss of economic access, the British state annexed new territory and
initiated military interventions in hopes of regaining some advantage, ensuring
economic inputs, and keeping rivals at their heels. In short, although there were
other factors involved in Britain’s new imperialism – such as the breakdown of
clientelism abroad and domestic economic crises – global competition played
an important part by making the British state feel more threatened and insecure.The Dynamics of Imperialism
215
Imperial aggression was a defensive move against an increasingly competitive –
that is, multicentric – global environment.
If this is true, then we should expect a similar logic to have produced Britain’s
earlier wave of direct imperialism in the eighteenth century (from the 1740s to
1815), when Britain was not in decline but struggling to ascend. This period
was not different in structure from the later decline period from 1874 to World
War I. Like that period, it was a highly competitive phase in the global sys-
tem. In 1750, the United Kingdom’s percentage share of world manufacturing
output was 1.9. France’s was 4.0, Russia’s was 5.0, and Austria-Hungary’s
was 2.9. 8 The European system, as Paul Kennedy notes, was “one of five
Great Powers – France, the Habsburg Empire, Prussia, Britain and Russia –
as well as lesser countries like Savoy and declining states like Spain.” 9 This
economic and attendant political competition was thus expressed overseas. By
the mid-1700s, for instance, Britain had already established a string of satel-
lite colonies along the North American coast and in parts of the Caribbean
(which were vital to Britain’s growing economy); however, Spain and France
were poised to halt Britain’s advance. 10 France dominated the slave trade, the
sugar sector, and the entrepôt trade in Caribbean produce; and both France
and Spain were positioned to take over Britain’s activities in other sectors. 11 In
the Ottoman empire and the Mediterranean, British merchants also faced com-
petition. Anglo-French rivalry in textiles was intense. Finally, Britain’s trade
with the European Continent faced repeated challenges. The Continent was the
dominant destination of British exports until the early 1770s. In 1750, Europe
accounted for 71 percent of British exports. 12 But Britain had to jostle against
rivals, especially France, to maintain position in the European market. 13
As with the late nineteenth century, this overarching climate of competition
at the close of the eighteenth century created consistent worry and concern
among British merchants, producers, and policy makers who fretted about
being pushed out completely. Men on the spot, as well as intellectuals in Lon-
don, watched Spain’s activities in the Americas and predicted that Spain was
making a comeback from its previous imperial heyday. 14 France was even
more of a threat. A common fear was that France would “master the whole
continent” in North America; that the French were “artfully working for uni-
versal Empire in America.” 15 London also worried about French expansion
in Europe, which would cut off Britain from a key market. 16 Meanwhile, in
Asia, the British envoys in Constantinople repeatedly worried about French

“encroachments on our trade” and that the French would “ruin us” in the
East Indies. 17 British political economists framed the competition as a zero-
sum game: Britain’s rivals had to be out-competed rather than just allowed to
coexist. Britain, they declared, must “control a general kind of lead in com-
merce distinct from any of the governments of Europe.” Only by gaining a lead
would Britain enjoy a vast “commercial dominion” without fear of rivalry. 18
Given this context, the same processes that led to imperial aggression in the
late nineteenth century unfolded during this phase too. First British capitalists
and merchants pressured the British state to annex new territories for protection
and advantage. Merchants pressed London for colonies so that they could have
“safe and unimpeded access to the consumers and sources of supply” all around
the world (much in the same way that merchants in the late nineteenth century
pressed for African colonies to ward off rival tariff blocs). 19 Various other
interest and lobbying groups – ranging from overseas planters to middle-class
merchants to financiers – also pushed for expansion on the same ground. 20
The pressure intensified during the formative decades of Britain’s industrial
transformation (the 1760s and 1770s). As rivals threatened to undo Britain’s
progress, financial interests and manufacturing groups pressed more firmly for
access to inexpensive raw materials and colonial markets. 21
Second, the British state became increasingly concerned about geopolitical
threats: The imperative of securing capital was conjoined with the imper-
ative of containing geopolitical rivals. Economic competition did not only
mean that capitalists’ interests were impacted; it also had implications for
security. In the Indies and the Americas, French merchants could undercut
British trade while French colonial holdings could serve as springboards for
invading Britain’s wealthy settlements or blockading vital trade routes during
wartime. 22 Furthermore, Britain’s “fiscal-military state” of the time demanded
that large portions of public funds go to the military, and public funds – when
not borrowed – depended on healthy foreign trade. Taxes from customs rev-
enues were especially important, not only as a new means to acquire money,
but as a domestic political strategy to keep a lower tax burden on Britain’s
landed class (who remained important political actors despite the onset of
industrialization). 23 Thus were trade and security intertwined. As one British
writer in 1735 summed, “[O]ur trade is the Mother and Nurse of our Seamen;
Our Seaman the Life of our Fleet; And our Fleet the Security and Protection
of our Trade: And that both together are the WEALTH, STRENGTH, AND

GLORY OF GREAT BRITAIN.” 24 Another writer asserted in 1765: “A Nation
cannot be safe without Power; Power cannot be obtained without Riches; nor
Riches without Trade.” 25
As with the late nineteenth century, British imperialism in this multicentric
phase was a response to heightened competition. Imperial aggression became
a way for the British state to fend off both economic and geopolitical threats
from rivals amidst its own bid for dominance in the field. It followed that
the targets of most of Britain’s territorial aggression were in the Americas and
the Caribbean; those very sites where Britain had growing economic interests
and where rivals were well positioned. 26 Taking territories in these areas was
aimed, first, at maintaining the security of Britain’s preexisting colonies and
trade routes against those rivals. William Pitt explained in 1761 that the key
objective in acquiring territory in the New World was the “entire safety” of
Britain’s North American possessions and especially “the secure possession
of that most valuable conquest of Canada.” 27 Taking territory was likewise
aimed at expanding trade into new areas, which in turn involved ousting or at
least containing rival empires. “The growing advantages [of taking additional
territory in Canada],” said William Shirley, former governor of Massachusetts,
were
. . . the State of Security, which the Settlers in North America would be put into, by
the Removal of the French; The extensive Trade with the Indians, the Increase of the
Fishery, the Rich vacant Country for new Settlements, and the quick Growth of their
Estates would make the Inhabitants increase if not in a Duplicate proportion to what
they have hitherto done, yet in a much greater degree. 28
The annexation of Florida was motivated similarly. It would remove the threat
of Spanish invasion of British North America from the south while also, as
Lord Shelburne explained, opening “a new field of commerce” and providing
“great additional resources for the increase of our naval power.” 29
Territorial expansion was also aimed at undercutting rivals’ trade and eco-
nomic power, thereby removing the economic and security threat at once.
In the 1740s, William Pitt had already laid out the essence of this idea, in
regard to Cape Breton: “The possession of this valuable island,” he said, “puts
it in our power absolutely to ruin the great trade carried on by the French to
North America.” 30 Later in the century, British statesmen like Secretary of State
Henry Dundas argued that taking complete control of the West Indies would be
beneficial “both in the view of humbling the power of France, and with the view

of enlarging our wealth and security.” 31 Proponents of expansion in London
in the 1790s asserted:
France is the only power whose maritime force has hitherto been a balance to that of
Great Britain and whose commerce has rivaled ours in the two worlds; whose intrigues
have fomented and kept alive the ruinous wars in India. Could England succeed in
destroying the naval strength of her rival; could she turn the tide of that rich commerce,
which has so often excited her jealousy, in favor of her own country . . . the degree of
commercial prosperity . . . would exceed all calculation. It would not be the work of a
few years only, but it would require ages for France to recover. 32
France’s Caribbean colonies had accounted for two-fifths of its total trade and
two-thirds of its ocean-going shipping tonnage by the late eighteenth century.
Taking former French colonies would disrupt this French circuit of economic
and naval power while expanding Britain’s own. 33 Fittingly, the British state
took the French colonies Tobago and St. Lucia because of their strategic posi-
tion within France’s network and the prospect of consolidating Britain’s net-
work in turn. 34
The similarities between Britain’s period of ascent (1750s–1815) and its
decline (1873–1914) should now be clear, as should the reason for why both
were marked by imperial boldness and assertion. Both were periods of multi-
centrism, which in turn meant a competitive global field. Aggressive imperial-
ism served as a way for the British state to gain or maintain position in that
competitive field. During its period of ascent in the late eighteenth century, the
British state was a rising contender, and direct imperialism accompanied its
bid to hegemony. Territorial expansion and related military might were ways
of cultivating strength while beating down rival bidders. By the same token
but from the other historical end, the British state employed direct imperialism
during its period of decline in the late nineteenth century to meet rising chal-
lengers. The very aggression that Britain had previously employed amidst its
bid was exhibited by challengers in the late nineteenth century, and the British
state responded in kind.
The fact that America’s waves of imperial aggression corresponded to multi-
polar phases in the global field can be explained similarly. As noted, there were
three waves of heightened imperialist aggression by the American state dur-
ing America’s long ascendancy from the late eighteenth century to World War
II. These are worth elaborating. The earlier two waves followed regional and
hemispheric dynamics (waves A and B, Figure 6.2). They were aimed at oust-
ing rival European powers, securing territory and control over the frontier, and
ultimately attaining hemispheric dominance. The earliest wave, beginning circa
1810, marked the American state’s drive to regional dominance. It involved
annexations and interventions to gain control over contiguous territory and to

fend off threats from rival European powers. The War of 1812 with Britain
was part of this wave. Other interventions included the occupation of the Ore-
gon territory and engagements in Spanish Florida. Fittingly, near the end of
this wave, President Monroe gave his 1823 annual message later known as the
Monroe Doctrine. Monroe bragged that over the previous decades the United
States had acquired vast new territories and had ended interference by Britain,
France, Russia, and Spain. He concluded: “[T]he American continents . . . are
henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any
European powers.” 35 This wave was likewise aimed at securing mercantile
power against rivals. Merchants had seen threats to their activities beginning
in 1808, and trade with Latin America and Caribbean countries offered some
hope, as long as the Spanish and British could be kept out and “freebooters”
contained. 36 Accordingly, although some deployments in this period took place
as far away as Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers, most took place in the Caribbean
(Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Santo Domingo) and involved troop landings to chase
down or suppress freebooters, pirates, or “marauders.” 37
The second wave of aggression occurred in the years from 1840 to 1870.
Whereas the previous wave marks America’s rise to regional dominance, this
wave represents America’s consolidation of hemispheric dominance. Fewer
instances of military force or territorial annexation involved activities in or
around contiguous territory on the continent (Table 6.4). The other instances
occurred outside the continent but within the hemisphere. For example, inter-
ventions in the Caribbean and Latin America doubled in number from the first
wave. This suggests that the United States, having secured mercantile control,
sought to expand it westward, looking for profitable passageways to the Pacific
through Nicaragua and Panama. The Gadsen Purchase from Mexico was part
of this endeavor, and American forces were deployed in Nicaragua at least
twice. Merchants also intensified their interest in places like Cuba and Santo

Domingo, leading to various instances of force in those areas. 38 The United
States also looked to the Asia-Pacific area as never before. The majority of
instances in this second wave took place there, whereas none had taken place
during the first wave (see Table 6.4). 39
As opposed to the first two waves, the third wave from the 1880s to 1914
(wave C, Figure 6.2) was much higher in frequency and intensity. It propelled
the American state onto the global stage. This was the period of America’s
ascent that coincided with heightened global competition. At the system level,
it was a multicentric phase, occurring at the same time as Britain’s decline
from hegemonic status. For Britain, multicentricity meant the appearance of
formidable rivals like Germany and the United States, poised as pretenders
to power. But for rivals like the United States, it meant facing a declining
hegemon threatening to reassert itself. It also involved potential confrontations
with a range of other pretenders to power. The famous American thinker
Brooks Adams, in his prescient book America’s Economic Supremacy (1900),
captured the scene. There was a “new struggle for life among nations,” he
wrote. It involved the relative decline of Britain (and older powers like Spain)
and the emergence of Russia, Japan, France, and the United States as rising
powers. Adams rightfully concluded that this period of heightened competition
was “one of those memorable revolutions wherein civilizations pass from an
old to a new condition of equilibrium.” He also noted that the period was
strikingly similar to the previous period of multicentricity in the late eighteenth
century when Britain was on the rise (1760 to 1815). The “last such revolution
ended with Waterloo,” Adams wrote, and “the one now at hand promises to
be equally momentous.” 40
Just as competition in the global field had fueled Britain’s bout of imperial
aggression in the late eighteenth century, so did it fuel the American states’
imperial aggression in this period. As revisionist historians have long shown,
American imperialism at this time was driven by multiple pressures felt in the
metropole: new racial ideologies and Social Darwinian discourses, the eco-
nomic crisis of 1893 and the related search for new markets and materials,
and an increasingly capable American state poised for global greatness after
emerging from the Civil War as a unified, powerful nation. 41 No doubt, these
factors are critical for understanding this wave of imperialism. Domestic eco-
nomic concerns associated with the 1893 depression would stand as partic-
ularly noteworthy. In fact, the Hobson-Lenin thesis that imperialism results
from capitalists’ fear of overproduction at home and the need for new markets

By 1855, in fact, “America’s commerce with Cuba had doubled during the previous decade,
becoming seven times greater than Great Britain’s and even four times larger than Spain’s –
which owned Cuba” (LaFeber 1989: 135).

originated in American business and policy-making circles. Before Hobson and
Lenin drafted their theories, American producers, led by the National Asso-
ciation of Manufacturers, and economists like Charles Conant argued that
America’s productive forces were overflowing and the domestic market could
not keep up. 42 They urged the American state to help secure global markets
to resolve the problem. The famed “China market” was one of the promised
outlets. 43
Still, the global climate of competition was also an important factor in
driving America’s imperialism. After all, domestic concerns may have made
capitalists in the National Association of Manufacturers or other business
groups pressure the American state to become interventionist overseas, but
this in itself would not guarantee an agreeable response on the part of the
American state. For imperialism to happen, the American state had to have
interests in it too. It did. This is because the new economic competition also
meant geopolitical competition.
For example, American policy makers and statesmen feared that upstarts like
Germany would thwart America’s hemispheric domination by making moves
on Latin America or the Caribbean. President Roosevelt spoke of how the
kaiser might “seize some Venezuelan harbor and turn it into a strongly forti-
fied place of arms . . . with a view to exercising some measure of control over the
future of the Isthmian Canal, and over South American affairs generally.” 44 He
and other statesmen at the time also worried about British or French encroach-
ment. During the 1895 Venezuelan boundary dispute with Britain, Senator
Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts connected the issue to a wider context of
threat. He argued that if the British were allowed to gain more territory in the
Americas, France and Germany would do the same, and so the United States
should take action lest “South America pass gradually into the hands of Great
Britain and other European powers.” 45
America’s subsequent involvement with Cuba and Puerto Rico in this period
partly followed from these concerns about the European threat. Control over
the Caribbean islands was seen as vital for controlling entry to the region and
for securing the route to the Panama Canal, which was also seized by the United
States at this time. The American state’s numerous troop deployments and
military occupations of Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti were
similarly preemptive. Military power was meant to deal with internal disorder –
this was important for American investment – but it was also meant to prevent
rival European powers from stepping in. Unchecked domestic instability would

Conant (1898).
The classic work on this thesis is McCormick (1967). A more recent view of American expansion
that sees Asia-Pacific more broadly as vital for U.S. interests is Cumings (2009). The argument
that the United States expanded abroad to meet domestic economic demands is a common
one among the revisionist historians: See, for instance, Williams (1972), LaFeber (1963), and
Williams (1969), pp. 408–53 especially.

Lodge quoted in Healy (1970), p. 26.222
Patterns of Empire
give rival powers an excuse to bring their own military power and hence gain
a foothold at the expense of U.S. interests. 46
America’s aggression in the Pacific was due to the same competitive structure.
The United States seized islands in the Pacific as stepping stones toward the
famed China market; that expansion was necessary to preempt control over
China and Asia-Pacific trade by other powers. In part, this necessitated building
up America’s naval capacities in the region. Alfred Mahan, the naval strategist
whose writings were widely influential on statesmen, was clear on this point.
He pinned the need for territory in the Pacific on the need for a powerful navy,
which was in turn necessary due to heightened international competition:
The general strenuous impulse of the great civilized states of the world to find and to
establish markets and commercial relations outside their own borders and their own
people, has led to multifold annexations, and to commercial and naval aggressions. In
these the United States has had no part, but they have constituted a political situation
that immensely increases her political and commercial anxieties and consequently her
naval responsibilities.
Mahan especially worried that other nations were expanding economically to
seek privileged markets and control: “[T]here is . . . the effort to extend and
sustain commercial advantage by the extension of political power, either by
controlling influence or by actual annexation, under cover of either of which
the commercial system of the particular country obtains favored conditions,
injurious to others, from special privilege all the way up to a practically exclu-
sive market.” 47 The only way to stop this was to expand militarily. That, in
turn, entailed imperial expansion.
Mahan’s views were representative and influential. In 1898, Charles Denby,
U.S. minister to China, conveyed the same fear of competition. His worrisome
observations are worth quoting at length, for they are indicative of the tenor
of the times:
The eyes of Europe are turned toward China and the European powers are arranging
far-reaching plans dictated by territorial ambition. . . . France is annexing territory on
her Tonquin frontier, and is building railroads into Yunnan. Russia has laid her hand on
Manchuria, and six hundred miles of Russian railroad in Chinese territory will shortly
connect the trans-Siberian system with the port of Viadivostock on the Pacific. Germany
is obtaining concessions. . . . Japan . . . is daily adding to her military and naval strength,
preparing to take her part in the coming struggle for supremacy on the mainland.
England has opened new territories for her commerce by asserting the right of British
merchants to navigate the West River, the key to the southwest of China. British trade
was never so flourishing in China as to-day and the supremacy of England’s naval
power in Asiatic waters sears testimony to her intention to defend it. All these powers
recognize the fact that trade follows the flag. Where their ships go and where they
make their national influence felt, there trade springs up to meet them. They recognize

that the present is a critical period in the history of China; that when the breaking up
and the inevitable partition come, those who have established themselves will obtain
recognition of their interests, those who have failed to do so must see their trade go to
the masters of the soil. . . . The people of the United States must not be content to see
their neighbors to the West, with their boundless potentialities of trade, handed over,
an uncontested prize, to the ambitions of Europe. 48
These concerns over European competition in the Asia-Pacific region had
already led to America’s interest in Hawaii and Samoa. “Hawaii holds in
the western sea much the same position as Cuba in the Atlantic,” wrote Secre-
tary of State James Blaine in 1881. “It is the key to the maritime dominion of
the Pacific States . . . under no circumstances can the United States permit any
change in the territorial control of either which would cut it adrift from the
American system, whereto they both belong.” 49 Most in Washington agreed,
which is why both areas were seized. “We need Hawaii just as much and a
good deal more than we did California,” asserted President McKinley in early
1898. 50 Henry C. Ide pressed for the acquisition of Samoa and Hawaii in
1897 on the grounds that “European nations have been swift to seize upon
the vantage points” in the region, and so the United States must swiftly do the
same. 51
America’s wave of imperial aggression was thus directed toward the “Open
Door”: The door not only had to be thrust open through force, but kept open
as rivals tried to close it. 52 The wider competitive environment made the threat
of closure all the more frightful. The interest of the McKinley administration in
the Philippines was partially dictated by this fear. McKinley worried that “our
commercial rivals in the Orient,” such as France and Germany, might annex
the Philippine archipelago if the United States did not. 53 These fears were not
allayed by the appearance of a German squadron in Manila Bay in early 1898;
nor by rumors circulating in the State Department that Germany was hoping
to annex the Philippines for itself. Taking the Philippines, Roosevelt argued,
would preempt any such attempts. 54
Other factors propelling America’s imperial expansion in the late nineteenth
century have been discussed in the scholarly literature. Here the point is to high-
light the similarities between U.S. direct imperialism in the late nineteenth cen-
tury with the late twentieth century and also the similarities between Britain’s
two phases of imperial expansion. On the one hand, each of these phases

Patterns of Empire
of imperial aggression involved distinct casual factors: In the late nineteenth
century, for instance, ideologies of racial inferiority likely helped propel col-
onization by the United States, whereas in the late twentieth century, U.S.
imperial aggression was partly due to the breakdown in clientelist networks
(as seen in the previous chapter). On the other hand, what all of these different
bouts of imperial aggression share is that they occurred in the systemic state
of multicentricity, those periods when one hegemon is in decline and rivals are
ascending. From our foregoing examination, we can now see that this multi-
centric structure of the global field matters, because multicentric phases mean
heightened economic competition. Such competition puts states at perilous risk.
For hegemons, there is the prospect of ultimate decline, as rising contenders
nip at their heels and steadily grow in strength. For the rising contenders, there
is the prospect that their ascent will be thwarted by their peers, as everyone
makes their bids for power. Thus, for both the declining hegemon and the rising
contenders, direct imperial aggression becomes the tactic of choice; a means of
warding off rivals, tempering the challenge from competitors if not undercut-
ting them, and securing position in the field. In this way, global competitive
fields breed imperial aggression.
But what about periods of hegemony, when competition is lessened?
Hegemony and Abatement
Periods of hegemony entail a different global structure than multicentric peri-
ods. In hegemonic periods, a rising state emerges typically from the ashes of a
world war to maintain a preponderance over the world economy. The global
field becomes unipolar: One state commands global economic flows more than
any single competitor. We have seen the correlates of this scenario: Both the
British and American states during their respective periods of hegemony less-
ened their direct aggression. Although still imperialistic, they nonetheless tem-
pered their boldness and entered a phase of imperial abatement. They initiated
fewer military interventions and slowed their rate of territorial expansion,
instead preferring clientelism, financial entanglements, and covert operations.
So what is it about hegemonic states that make them less interested in direct
imperialism?
The beginnings of an answer can be found if we reconsider Britain’s trade
policies. The British state took steps to liberalize global trade amid its period
of hegemony. Despite the protectionist Corn Law of 1815, the British state
nonetheless enacted the Reciprocity of Duties Act (1823) that promoted recip-
rocal agreements with foreign governments to free up trade. Progress was slow,
but these steps demonstrated Britain’s willingness to reduce mercantilist restric-
tions if not eventually abandon them altogether. 55 In the end many restrictions
were lifted, as Britain entered into various treaties that reduced discriminatory
tariffs and repealed the Corn Laws in 1846. Thus, Britain showed a stronger
55

225
desire to end mercantilism during its period of hegemony than during the
late eighteenth century. The reason why is informative: British firms and the
British state were confident that open markets would be to their benefit. Of
course, Britain’s industrialization and population growth compelled industry
to seek more markets and raw materials, and this was one reason behind lib-
eralization. However, the related push came from British industry’s belief that
markets and materials would be more easily obtained through liberalization
rather than restricted mercantilist markets attendant with colonialism. That
belief was premised on the assumption that British capital would benefit most
from any such liberalization. 56 Provide an open playing field, and British firms
will fare best. Obviously, this was a very different view than those espoused in
the eighteenth century, when mercantilism ruled. Mercantilism assumed that
tariffs were the best way to serve the interests of capital. But the new view of
liberalization was different: It marked a new confidence.
As scholars have argued, the new view and self-confidence became dominant
during Britain’s period of hegemony because of that hegemony precisely. The
self-confidence driving liberalization first emerged among British industrialists
and traders who saw monumental success during the Napoleonic Wars. It
continued to spread as more and more firms saw increasing successes and
looked to fields abroad. 57 British officials and policy makers came around
to the notion at the same time. 58 Together they liked liberalization because
they knew Britain enjoyed comparative advantage. Dominant already in the
economic field, and enjoying the most capital, machinery, and high relative
productivity, British firms would out-compete anyone given a level playing
field and thus reap the most rewards from an open trading economy. 59 If
anything, tariffs would hurt British capital: It would encourage other nations
to maintain tariffs, thereby shutting British capital out.
Anticolonialism followed partly from this view. If colonialism meant mer-
cantilism, and if mercantilism hurt rather than helped British capital, it would
be better not to bother with the expense of territorial rule. The reality at the
time must have given sustenance to this view, for British trade in these years
saw as much economic fruit outside of the British empire as within it. By the
1850s, exports to the British formal empire constituted only about 30 percent:
The rest went to nominally independent nations, especially the United States,

“Britain found no need to strive for preferential access in foreign markets, remaining confident
that its comparative advantage in manufactured goods would ensure the success of exporters,
provided only that non-discriminatory treatment of its goods abroad was assured.” Irwin
(1993), p. 94.
See, on the immediate post-1815 period, Hilton (1977). See also the excellent overview in Cain
(1999), pp. 38–9.

This is an argument made by proponents of the “hegemonic stability” thesis, among many oth-
ers. See especially Gilpin (1978) and Krasner (1976). Gilpin argues that the strongest countries
reap the most benefits from liberalization (see for example Gilpin [1975], p. 84).226
Patterns of Empire
Europe, and Latin America. 60 In 1860, only one-fifth of imports came from
within the empire. 61 Although trade within the empire was still important,
policy makers and businesses alike began to see that trade could flourish even
without colonies. Trade needed to expand, but, as the historian Kitson Clark
put it long ago, the expansion was not to occur through “force of arms, or the
extension of territorial sovereignty,” but rather through “the much more subtle
weapon of cheapness, the cheapness of the goods produced in Great Britain, a
weapon which did not need the might of empire to back it up.” 62
Britain’s imperial abatement in the nineteenth century can now be appre-
hended. Compared to the previous period of ascent or the later period of
decline, the threats to British economic power were minimal. Therefore, there
was less of a need to seek privileged access to markets or materials through
direct imperialism or to spend resources trying to undercut rivals. All that was
needed was the open market. This is likely why the British state, by its trade
agreements with other states, reduced tariffs even for its colonies: It no longer
saw the need for a colonial empire covered under a mercantilist umbrella.
Colonies might still be useful, not least for military bases; but they were no
longer the only route to economic prosperity. Lord Macauley argued against
taking over all of India in 1833 on these grounds exactly. “The mere extent
of empire is not necessarily an advantage. . . . It would be . . . far better for us
that the people of India . . . were ruled by their own kings, but wearing our
broadcloth, and working with our cutlery, than . . . performing their salaams
to English collectors and English magistrates.” 63 Hegemony meant compara-
tive advantage. Comparative advantage meant a preference for markets over
force and money over territory.
This notion of comparative advantage was articulated by various govern-
ment offices in London when deciding against new annexations. For example,
the British state repeatedly declined opportunities to take Sarawak in the 1850s
and 1860s. Although some British firms near Sarawak supported annexation,
arguing that it was necessary to fend off the nearby Dutch, British officials in
London were not worried. Lord Carnavaron explained that the Dutch need not
be feared, because “our freer system of trade might give us some advantages
over the Dutch.” 64 The Foreign Office concurred, adding that “the Dutch are
and must remain too weak to cause us any alarm.” 65 Similarly, although British
trade with the Niger Delta slowly grew in importance through the 1840s to the
1860s, the British state appointed a consul to the region rather than colonize it.
The reason was simply that there was no other European presence in the region,
and British trade need not worry about competition. 66 Another example is Fiji.

When the Colonial Office in London was offered by Fijian chiefs to annex Fiji,
it turned the offer down, despite rumors that the French might take it instead.
Part of the reason was fear of settler–native conflicts (as discussed in Chapter
4), but another was Britain’s comparative advantage. Even if France took Fiji,
France would not pose an economic threat, but rather a possible boon: Given
Britain’s position in the region, the French would be forced to import from
British sources. “Should she [France] seize the Islands, England would have lit-
tle cause of inquietude; as in forming her Establishments France would import
largely from the English colonies.” 67
None of this is to say that the British state failed to initiate direct imperi-
alism entirely. We have seen in previous chapters that the British state took
colonies like Hong Kong and added territory to its domains in India. Yet these
acquisitions were fewer in number relative to Britain’s previous ascent phase
or its later decline phase (both phases of multicentrism). They are exceptions
that prove the rule. And their acquisition was not governed by the same forces
that propelled expansion in multicentric periods. They were not about obtain-
ing privileged access or undercutting rivals amidst the threat of competition.
Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Falkland Islands were taken as trading ports or
naval stations so that Britain could enhance existing trade or expand into new
areas on which Britain had commercial rather than territorial designs (e.g.,
China and Latin America). As ports rather than massive territories of land,
these were small acquisitions that made larger acquisitions unnecessary. Other
acquisitions were governed by a settler-frontier logic. Most of the territories
annexed in this time were contiguous with or adjacent to preexisting British
settlements, for instance, on the coast of Africa, around India, in Canada,
and/or in Australia. These were typically taken at the behest of settlers to
protect the integrity of preexisting boundaries against local populations. 68 To
be sure, except for areas like India, rival powers were few and far between.
As Kennedy puts it, “between 1815 and 1880 much of the British Empire
existed in a power-political vacuum. . . . [I]n many parts of the tropics, and for
long periods of time, British interests (traders, planters, explorers, missionaries)
encountered no foreigners other than the indigenous peoples.” 69
In the absence of competition from serious challengers, the principle of
restraint was at work. With economic dominance in the global field and the
attendant lack of competition, new territory was not necessary. If anything,
colonial expansion or other forms of direct imperialism would upset the status
quo from which Britain so benefited. It might incite the anger of other states,
delegitimate British hegemony, and invite others to make their own bids. “We
have possession,” wrote Wellington in 1829, “of nearly every valuable port
and colony in the world, and I confess that I am anxious to avoid exciting

the attention and jealousy of other powers by extending our possessions, and
setting the example of gratification of a desire to seize more territories.” 70
Restraining from territorial aggrandizement was partly performative, aimed at
ensuring the existing geopolitical structure and hence the British position in it.
In 1857, Lord Palmerston advised against annexing Egypt on these grounds
precisely. In his letter to Lord Clarendon, he admitted that “many parts of
the world would be better governed by England.” However, because Britain’s
position depended on “the maintenance of the existing balance of power,”
Britain should be careful not to become “unprovoked aggressors” overseas or
acquire African territory: “[L]et us try to improve all those countries by the
general influence of our commerce, but let us abstain from a crusade of con-
quest which would call down upon us the condemnation of all other civilized
nations.” 71 The same principle animated Secretary of State Aberdeen’s position
on California in 1841. Sir Thomas Pakenham, minister to Mexico, at that time
conveyed an interest in setting up a British colony in California (then part of
Mexico). Aberdeen replied that he was “not anxious for the formation of new
and distant Colonies, all of which involve heavy direct and still heavier indi-
rect expenditure, besides multiplying the liabilities of misunderstanding and
collisions with Foreign Powers.’” 72 In short, rather than upset the system from
which they and capitalists benefited, state managers preferred to keep things
intact by not seizing new swaths of territory. As long as the British state was on
top of the hierarchy with little threat from below, it had an interest in stability
and order.
This interest meant not only restraining from territorial aggrandizement; it
also meant diplomacy with other states rather than military force. Too much
aggression would incite other powers and threaten to overthrow stable rela-
tions. This was the approach taken by British officials during the Congress
of Vienna at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Having emerged victorious and
comparably unscathed, Britain negotiated a postwar settlement that was aimed
at preventing disruptive wars and maintaining a balance of power on the Euro-
pean Continent. Because Britain was the most powerful economically, it stood
to gain from this arrangement: If other states agreed to the settlement, direct
military intervention and costly war would be unnecessary. 73 The strategy
involved buying allies. Britain used subsidies and loans to states like Prussia,
Austria, and Sweden – as well as arms and contributions to Spain, Portugal,
and Sicily – to help win the war and render them dependent on British good
will. The subsidies were known as “Pitt’s gold.” 74 Yet this form of making
alliance was precarious, not to mention expensive. So the British state also

strove for cultural hegemony. In the words of G. John Ikenberry, it exercised
“strategic restraint” to maintain the status quo. 75 Britain strove to legitimate
its dominance and maintain a balance of power on the European Continent by
showing that it would use excessive force. This would limit the possibility of
future rivalry and hence limit future threats to British hegemony.
Strategic restraint at the Congress of Vienna translated into performative
anticolonialism. To show its moderation, Britain deliberately opted against
acquiring the former Dutch colonies at the Congress. “I am sure our reputation
on the Continent as a feature of our strength, power and confidence,” declared
Castlereagh, “is of more real value to us than any acquisition thus made.” 76
British officials also stood back as various crises broke out across the European
Continent, trying not to meddle directly and thereby upset the equilibrium
from which Britain so clearly benefited. This “minimalist participation,” notes
Patrick Karl O’Brien, was meant “to avoid enmity towards the Empire and
envy at Britain’s huge stake in overseas trade, shipping, and investment.” In
fact, over the entire period, the only time when British troops again operated
on the European Continent was during the Crimean War of 1854–1856. This
stands as the exception; for the most part, British power was aimed at “co-
opting” other states “into a system for the orderly and predictable conduct
of international relations, especially commerce, that could remain efficient for
the security of the empire and for the preservation of the dominant role that
the British economy had attained in world trade and in servicing the global
economy.” 77
Britain’s imperial abatement was thus driven by its place within the over-
arching global field and by that field’s very structure. Because Britain was
hegemonic, and by the same token because the global field was unipolar with
minimal competition, the British state tended toward restraint. Its comparative
advantage in the economic field meant that serious competition was absent,
and direct imperialism was not necessary for undercutting rivals or gaining
privilege. Moreover, Britain’s position in the field meant that it had an interest
in maintaining the status quo, which in turn meant influencing other states
through hidden and subtle exercises of power rather than bold, direct, and
provocative imperialism that might mobilize opposition. We now know that
it was only when Britain’s share of trade was later threatened that this strat-
egy shifted and military aggression or direct rule became more necessary. But
generally for the nineteenth century, the British state followed the principle of
informal rule when possible and formal rule when necessary (to paraphrase a

O’Brien (2002), p. 11. It is the case, as seen in a previous chapter, that the English state
summoned its military might to attack China and threaten South America. But as Kitson Clark
notes, in general “these occasions were only the contingent consequences of the movement
caused by the ebullient power of a world-wide commerce, which normally did not need the
power of empire to secure its entry.” See Kitson Clark (1967), p. 78. See also for this point

famous phrase from Robinson and Gallagher). It only became more necessary
during the multicentric phase of intense competition and British decline. 78
Was America’s imperial abatement during its hegemonic phase in the mid-
twentieth century governed by the same logic? From a previous chapter, we
have already seen that the United States did not seize colonies during its period
of hegemonic maturity. Besides turning the former Japanese mandated islands
into “strategic trust” territory in the immediate aftermath of the Second World
War, it tempered its territorial ambition and preferred informal mechanisms
of imperial power. We have also seen that part of the reason for this was the
global spread of anticolonial nationalism. Anticolonial nationalism made the
costs of recolonization far too high. Still, territorial annexation is not the only
expression of direct imperialistic aggression. Besides annexation, the United
States might have initiated temporary military occupations or military assaults
such as those that proliferated later in the century during America’s period of
decline. So why were there fewer of those types of actions during the period of
U.S. hegemonic maturity?
Part of the answer lies in the rivalry between the United States and USSR
during the Cold War. Too much military aggression would anger the Soviets
and spark a global confrontation that, given the development of nuclear tech-
nology, would be disastrous to everyone. The fear of provoking the Soviets
was important to key policy makers of the period, such as Dean Acheson in
the State Department, who preferred covert operations for precisely this rea-
son. Covert operations, such as the clandestine activities by the CIA against
Communists in Greece in 1947, were meant to fight against Soviet influence
without being blatantly aggressive and confrontational. 79 Similarly, President
Dwight Eisenhower was reluctant to intervene in Hungary in 1956, despite his
talk of “liberating” Eastern Europe from the USSR, because of this same fear
of provoking the Soviets. 80
Yet in itself, the desire to avoid direct confrontation with the USSR does
not explain abatement. The 1945 Yalta agreements with Churchill, Stalin, and
Roosevelt had specified different spheres of influence: The USSR would have
one-third of the globe (much of east of the Oder-Nesse Line in Europe across
through China), whereas the United States and its allies would de facto control
the rest. This means that the United States could have heightened its imperi-
alistic activity in its own spheres of influence – such as its own hemisphere –
with less risk of a hot war. And we know that the American state did indeed
heighten its military activity in Central America despite the Cold War: In the
1980s, during America’s period of economic decline, the United States invaded
Panama and Grenada. So why, during America’s period of hegemony were
there not more Panamas and Grenadas? Why the relative decrease in imperial
aggression?

As was the case with Britain in the nineteenth century, part of the answer lies
in America’s structural position as hegemon and, therefore, America’s compar-
ative advantage. From 1948 onward, the United States accounted for a larger
proportion of international trade than any other country. 81 Of the world’s fifty
largest corporations in 1956, forty-two were American. 82 In 1950, no country
in the world had a GNP totaling even one-third that of America’s. 83 Econom-
ically dominant, the United States had fewer economic rivals than in other
periods, and American firms as well as the American state fretted less about
obtaining privileged access to other countries or regions than they did earlier
in the century. As long as doors were kept open through treaties or subsidies,
they need not have been forced open by military power.
Due to America’s relative economic power after the war, this is exactly
what happened. We have already seen that the United States used its economic
power after the Second World War to compel the European empires to open
their colonies up to American trade. Here it should also be noted that the
United States used its economic might to compel Europe itself to be opened
up. By conditions attached to various loans and subsidies from 1945 onward,
the United States was able to make the dollar supreme and increase trade with
Europe. 84 Given the power of its dollar, the American state did not have to
employ direct imperialism to open up the world to its economic interests. It
could buy it. This repeated what Britain had tried to do during and after the
Napoleonic Wars. 85 It is the hegemon’s privilege to use money so that direct
imperialism would be less necessary. Pitt’s gold is the hegemon’s gold.
America’s economic hegemony also meant that officials and policy makers
in Washington had a stronger interest in maintaining rather than altering the
status quo from which the United States so benefited. The global order had to
be kept intact rather than transformed, if only because U.S. hegemony relied on
it. This is how the Cold War fits into the story. The containment policy – first
advocated by Dean Acheson to help justify the Korean War and then embedded
in the famous National Security Council document 68 (NSC-68) of 1950 – was
to let the USSR coexist with the United States because this was deemed the best
way to ensure stability. 86 The Yalta agreement of 1945 had expressed the basic

The United States encouraged a regional European bloc in the interests of promoting its internal
development, which in turn helped increase trade, even as the actual stipulations in the loans did

see the seminal works by Gaddis (1982) and Leffler (1992). Gaddis and Leffler differ in their
opinions on America’s global ambitions: Leffler suggests that America’s Cold War containment
strategy was essentially about overthrowing the Soviet Union in the end, whereas Gaddis is
closer to the view that containment was more about maintaining a bipolar political order.232
Patterns of Empire
idea. By Yalta, the Soviets were unofficially granted jurisdiction over the areas
essentially occupied by the Red Army already, and the United States was given
the rest. This was simply “an agreement on the status quo,” as Wallerstein puts
it. 87 The agreement had the effect of global stabilization. As both the United
States and USSR more or less kept their end of the bargain, overt military
aggression would not be necessary for security. 88
In short, America’s hegemonic position gave the American state an interest
in the existing geopolitical structure. The status quo was vital for America’s
own vitality. This was not just a matter of maintaining the peace; it was a
matter of maintaining the existing structure of the global hierarchy so that
the United States remained at the apex. If the order from which the American
economy benefited was unraveled, so might America’s economic hegemony.
George Kennan neatly summed up the imperative in a foreign policy review
by the State Department in 1948: “We have about 50% of the world’s wealth
but only 6.3% of its population. This disparity is particularly great as between
ourselves and the peoples of Asia. In this situation, we cannot fail to be the
object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise
a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of
disparity without positive detriment to our national security.” 89
One result of this search for stability was containment. Another was the
Atlantic Charter and then, ultimately, the United Nations. The final and more
important result for our purposes was strategic restraint. As for Britain after
1815, so too for the United States: Strategic restraint meant displays of moder-
ation in order to gain the acquiescence of other states. In the case of the United
States, strategic restraint was partly directed at the colonial and postcolonial
world. Already we have seen that American policy makers were concerned
about their prestige in the eyes of the colonial world and the newly indepen-
dent countries. This concern militated against any American-led recolonization
of postcolonial areas. However, the concern over maintaining prestige also
prevented the United States from engaging in excessive militaristic aggression.
This is why covert action was preferable to overt action: Not only would overt
action anger the Soviets, it would incite third-world nationalists and put the
global political equilibrium from which the United States benefited at risk. 90

The times when it became more necessary were when the ambiguities in the Yalta agreements
became manifest, such as during the Korean crisis that led to the Korean War. But this, along
with Vietnam, was the exception that proved the rule. To be sure, even those instances when
the United States and USSR were unclear on their boundaries – such as the Greek civil war
(1946–1949), the Hungarian crisis (1956), the question of Eastern Europe as a whole from
1945–1947 – there was no full-scale conflict. American military power was not used to resolve
it. Generally, Yalta worked. See Wallerstein (2006), p. 79.

The concern over prestige and global stability also explains why the Eisen-
hower administration was so incensed over the French, British, and Israeli
invasion of the Suez Canal in 1956. This is an instance where U.S. interests
were threatened and direct imperial aggression could have been used – but was
not. The reason why it was not cuts to the heart of our story.
Successive American administrations had not been happy with Egyptian
President Gamal Nasser. His decision to nationalize the Suez Canal was a
direct challenge to America’s influence in the region. But Eisenhower did not
command U.S. forces to join the French-British-Israeli invasion. To the con-
trary, he pulled the invasion back, precisely because he worried about Amer-
ica’s loss of prestige and hence, potentially, disequilibrium in the global order.
Eisenhower had said in early October of 1956 that direct military action to
oust Nasser “could not be taken where there is as much hostility as at present.
For a thing like this to be done without inflaming the Arab world, a time free
from heated stress holding the world’s attention as at present would have to be
chosen.” 91 Ambassador Jefferson Caffrey had prefigured Eisenhower’s views. If
Arab nationalists were aroused, he had warned, the Suez would “explode with
a loud bang at no distant date, an explosion with a potential chain reaction of
occupation, revolution, eventual Commie domination.” 92 It is not surprising
that, in the wake of the curtailed invasion, the United States chose to han-
dle Nasser through covert operations. 93 Hidden imperialism was preferable
to direct imperialism, lest the world mobilize its anger against the American-
dominated global order.
Even before the onset of the Cold War and the containment policy, and
before the 1956 Suez fiasco, the postwar American state was concerned about
displaying restraint in order to maintain the status quo. Here restraint was
aimed not at the colonial or postcolonial world, but at its allies. We have seen
that British officials from Wellington to Palmerston often militated against new
colonial acquisitions on the grounds that it would incite envy or resentment
from other states, unwittingly encourage them to also seek colonies, and ulti-
mately threaten the balance of power. The American state did the same in the
wake of World War II. When the Truman administration pondered seizing
the former Japanese Pacific territories unilaterally after the war, it hesitated
because of this very concern. Unilateral seizure would make the United States
appear too greedy and set off, as Wm. Roger Louis puts it, “a new scramble for
territory.” 94 The State Department similarly worried that unilateral seizure of

Lucas (2000), p. 152. Louis (1985), p. 414. The subsequent invasion by British and French
forces invoked the Eisenhower administration’s ire not only because the Americans had not
been consulted, but also because the administration feared how the invasion would look to the
rest of the world. Dulles hit the nail on the head: The invasion was “nothing but the straight
old-fashioned variety of colonialism of the most obvious sort,” and this the United States could
not abide (ibid., p. 414).
Louis (1978), p. 85.234
Patterns of Empire
the islands would invite Britain to reinitiate colonialism in the Middle East and
threaten stability there. 95 Acquiring colonies would also undermine America’s
“moral prestige and political leadership” – as one State Department official
put it – and run against “our general security policy.” 96 Of course, later, as
anticolonial nationalism and the Cold War extended its grip over the world, the
United States would also restrain from colonial acquisitions lest third-world
nationalists retaliate with ire. But in this immediate postwar period, one of
the main worries was that territorial aggrandizement would set off other grabs
for power and initiate a chain of destabilizing events, thereby threatening the
geopolitical hierarchy upon which American hegemony rested.
Much more could be said about America’s period of imperial abatement, but
the similarities with the British state in the nineteenth century should be clear
by now. As both the American and British states were economically dominant,
both were intent on maintaining the status quo. This involved a policy of
strategic restraint and therefore an aversion to direct imperialism. Rather than
delegitimate their hegemony or upset the existing structure by blatant land
grabbing or hasty military assaults, the two hegemonic states tried to cultivate
imperial power by more indirect and hidden means.
Finally, understanding this process helps us apprehend the trends in imperial
discourse. For both states, self-identification as “empire” was minimized during
the hegemony period. This can be seen as part of an attempt to legitimate their
global dominance and prevent inciting others. The historian A. P. Thornton’s
classic study of mid-Victorian British self-conception is telling. “In the view
of all Englishmen of substance [in the 1840s and 1850s], whose own idols
were progress, Free Trade, and the pax Britannica, ‘Empire’ was a foreign joss,
whose worshippers, where they were not simply benighted, were assumed to be
the sinister agents of the forces of wrong. Secure in that mid-Victorian power
which was based jointly on the buoyancy of her economy and her navy, Great
Britain had no need to pursue politics of national self-aggrandisement. Having
no need, she had accordingly had no business to seek to do so.” 97 This might
apply equally well to American denials of empire in the mid-twentieth century.

Conclusion
To an outsider, the fact that America is an empire is the most obvious fact of all.

The so-called American Empire is in fact a feeble imitation of the Roman, British,
and French empires.
– Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. (2005) 2
It has become more common to think of the United States as an empire.
Although some “empire deniers” persist, they face an increasingly loud chorus
of post-revisionist scholars, pundits, and even officials who are willing to enter-
tain the idea that the United States is and always has been imperial. 3 This book
joins that chorus, but it has also sought to push further, dig a little deeper, and
look more widely. Rather than seeking a warrant to call the United States an
empire, this book has put America’s imperial formation in comparative light.
It has examined differences and similarities between America’s imperial prac-
tices, forms, and dynamics on the one hand and Britain’s imperialism on the
other. The United States is and has been an empire; this book has examined its
differences and similarities with its predecessor.
To be clear, this book has not been about world powers or “great powers.”
Empire is not the same thing as a great power. Nor has this book been con-
cerned with every aspect of the two empires or every actor or group involved
in the two empires. Such an analysis would hardly be possible in a single vol-
ume. Instead, in our search for similarities and differences, we have focused
on the imperial policies, modalities, and forms exercised by the imperial state
(rather than private corporations or transnational institutions). Furthermore,

Patterns of Empire
we have covered only those imperial issues summoned by existing exception-
alist claims. Exceptionalism implies that the U.S. colonial empire has been
more liberal, benign, and tutelary than other empires. Accordingly, Chapter 2
has tried to assess this claim by examining U.S. colonialisms in Puerto Rico
and the Philippines, comparing them with other colonies in the U.S. empire,
and comparing them all with Britain’s. Similarly, exceptionalist thought sug-
gests that America’s nonterritorial imperialism in the twentieth century reflects
America’s domestic political values. Therefore, Chapters 3 and 4 explored the
United States’ and Britain’s informal imperialism and the forces shaping them.
In brief, the focus of this book has been on the exceptionalist themes implicitly
and explicitly raised in existing discussions about American empire. The over-
arching goal of this book has been to assess these exceptionalist themes; to see
how far exceptionalism gets us and perhaps look beyond.
The comparative method of the book has been precisely motivated. Rather
than arbitrarily comparing the two empires or picking from the archive what-
ever suits our argument, the exploration has used economic historical phases as
a guiding light. We have compared the policies, practices, and forms of the two
empires by looking at them at comparable stages in the larger cycle of hege-
mony: ascent, hegemonic maturity, and decline. This has given some amount
of control to an otherwise slippery comparison, enabling us to make sure that
our comparative claims about the empires are not spurious. The method carries
limitations of course. By using relative economic status in the world system as
the guide, the analysis runs the risk of overlooking other important dimensions
of the two empires. But the bet is that this comparative method offers greater
analytic purchase than otherwise. At the very least, it enables us to better
assess existing assertions of American exceptionalism that have not attempted
to validate their claims through controlled comparisons.
What, then, does the book tell us of the exceptionalism thesis for understand-
ing American power abroad? The conclusion here is unequivocal. Exception-
alism obscures more than it enlightens. It masks complex histories of imperial
power exercised by both the U.S. and British empires. It overlooks important
similarities between the two empires and blinds us to localized and sometimes
global logics that shape imperial policies, practices, and processes. As both a set
of claims about what happened and as explanatory framework, exceptionalism
should be put to rest.
As a set of claims, exceptionalist thought has long posited a fundamental
break between American and British history: The United States cast off English
tyrannical monarchism and set a course for a new anti-imperial, liberal demo-
cratic future. Yet we have seen that the United States did not so much break
with its English imperial past as it did pick up the mantle. It did so, first, as
the original thirteen colonies expanded westward, adopting some of the same
imperial tactics and techniques that the British had handed down. It did so
again in the late nineteenth century, as it expanded overseas to rule colonies
such as Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Guam, and Samoa, sometimes deploying
modalities of colonial rule not unlike those of their British peers and, in someConclusion
237
cases, modeled directly on them. And it did so again after the Second World
War. The American state first outsourced imperial functions to the British state.
Then, once the British imperial formation began to fissure under the pressure
of global anticolonial movements, the American state took over in the spaces
the British empire (and European empires) left behind. To do so, the Ameri-
can state mobilized the very same tactics of informal empire that the British
state had deployed in places like Africa and Latin America a century earlier.
The United States did not denounce the imperial legacy it inherited; rather, it
repeatedly deployed its forms.
We have also seen that the two empires developed similarly over time. Both
began as settler empires expanding into contiguous areas. Both then moved
farther and farther away from the metropolitan center, constructing adminis-
trative colonial empires that ruled a diversity of peoples. As the British empire
expanded to Asia and Africa after 1815, it crafted colonial states employing
multiple modalities of rule, ranging from assimilation projects to paternalistic
protection to sheer repression. Likewise, as America’s frontier expansion led
to overseas expansion into the Caribbean and the Pacific, the United States
crafted colonial regimes exhibiting similar variations in colonial governmen-
tality. Finally, over the longer dureé, the American empire reiterated the waves
of aggression initiated by its British predecessor. Following the same pattern
of extension, abatement, and reassertion, the American empire summoned the
tactics of the British empire while also replaying its historical dynamics – and
perhaps, too, its foibles and follies. Plus ça change, plus c’est la meme chose.
Exceptionalism runs the risk of overlooking these similarities by claiming an
essential difference between the American and British empires. It also occludes
its own banality. Some historians have insisted that because the United States
has produced so much exceptionalist anti-imperial scholarship, it must be
intrinsically anti-imperial. 4 Yet this misses the fact that exceptionalist discourse
itself is not unique: Britons in the nineteenth century likewise exhibited ambiva-
lence about their empire, if they did not deny its existence entirely. When they
did admit of empire, they saw it as uniquely benign and liberal – a distinct
empire for liberty (as seen in Chapter 1). Even the historical swings and shifts
in exceptionalist discourse are not unique to the American scene. During both
states’ hegemonic phases, imperial self-identification was much weaker than
during the later period associated with the two states’ new imperialisms or the
earlier period of ascent. Exceptionalist thought in the two empires’ hegemonic
phases thus extended the imperial states’ own historically specific global strat-
egy. Just as the United States during its hegemonic mode preferred informal
empire to formal rule and sought to legitimate itself to the world as a benign
power, so too did exceptionalism’s proponents portray the United States as
an anti-imperial force. And just as the British empire in the mid-nineteenth
century portrayed itself as a non-empire rooted in free trade rather than mer-
cantilism, so too did many Britons hesitate to recognize the British empire as
4
Suri (2009), p. 531.238
Patterns of Empire
an empire proper. Such shifts and cross-imperial comparisons invite us to his-
toricize exceptionalism as a mode of thought. Rather than illuminating truths,
exceptionalist thought (whether in its American or British variant) more likely
reflects the empire’s own shifting self-consciousness – not to mention its strate-
gic public image. According to Karl Marx, bourgeois economics is bourgeois
society’s understanding of itself. It may be that, likewise, exceptionalist thought
is empire’s preferred self-apprehension.
None of this is to deny differences between the American and British imperial
formations. Some scholars have already probed some differences in the two
states’ economic hegemonies and military capacities. Renowned historian Paul
Kennedy remains amazed that the United States in 2000 accounted for close
to 36 percent of world defense spending, far exceeding anything Britain might
have mobilized during its heyday. “Nothing has ever existed like this disparity
of power; nothing.” 5 Still, the concern here is of the two states’ imperial policies
and practices, not their standing as great powers; and on this count there
are differences too. America’s approach to some of its colonies, for example,
had a much more palpable and consistent tutelary character than Britain’s. In
Puerto Rico and the Philippines, the United States provided colonial institutions
like elections and native offices much more swiftly than in Britain’s colonies.
Furthermore, after the Second World War and the subsequent acquisition of
the former Japanese-mandated territories (current-day Micronesia), the United
States did not seize any more colonies. Whereas Britain annexed new territory
in the nineteenth century, the United States a century later resorted primarily
to military occupations and informal tactics of imperial influence. Compared
to Britain’s, America’s imperial formation since the mid-twentieth century has
been much less territorially bound.
These differences cannot be overlooked. Exceptionalist thought surely does
not overlook them. It seizes on them to validate its assertions. But let us remem-
ber: Difference is not the same thing as exceptionalism. Exceptionalism not
only asserts difference; it sees the difference as unrivaled uniqueness – that
is, everything else is the same and the United States deviates from that same-
ness. Furthermore, exceptionalism treats difference as essential, a matter of
fundamental quality, not quantity, and explains difference between entities
by reference to that essence. In this view, the United States deviates from the
sameness – from the general rule – because of its unique national character and
institutions.
The differences between the U.S. and British empires that we have found
in this book are not of this sort. First, America’s liberal governmentality in
Puerto Rico and the Philippines was not reflective of an American essence: It
was itself an exception in light of America’s colonial policies in Guam and
Samoa. Second, even America’s approach to Puerto Rico and the Philippines
was not entirely unrivaled; in comparative perspective, it appears as little else
than a more extended form of Britain’s preexisting approach to India – a
5

239
matter of degree rather than fundamental kind. In addition, the reason for
the tutelage approach in the Philippines and Puerto Rico had less to do with
America’s inherent character of culture than with preexisting local conditions
in the two colonies conjoined with the colonial state’s legitimacy imperative.
Liberal policies in the colonies reflected the advanced political culture of the
local colonial elite rather than the political culture of the United States.
The same goes for the other difference we have found. The American
empire’s reliance on informal modalities of power after World War II rather
than formal colonialism was not determined by America’s intrinsic qualities but
rather by the qualities of the global field in which it operated. This is probably
why the United States is not an exception even on this score: Few if any major
states in the entire world have annexed territory in the mid- to late twentieth
century. 6 Yet according to exceptionalism’s logic, the United States should be
the only nonterritorial imperialist. And according to exceptionalism’s logic,
China’s current unwillingness to colonize Africa and its preference for infor-
mal methods of imperialism on that continent must mean that it is intrinsically
anticolonial, that China’s “national character” or “culture” militates against
imperialism. It is hard to accept that claim.
Here we arrive at the other aspect of exceptionalism that this book chal-
lenges. Exceptionalism falters not only in its descriptive claims about what
happened, but also in its explanations. According to exceptionalist thought,
what the United States does is determined by what ostensibly it is: a benign lib-
eral democracy with a deep anti-imperial tradition. The reason why the United
States acts the way it does in the world is because of its so-called national style,
its deep values, its constitution, or its culture. Presumably, colonial modes
of rule or imperial policies are determined by America’s national character,
its cultural forms, or the dispositions of imperial personnel. 7 Here, however,
the underlying problem with exceptionalism’s explanatory regime is starkly
disclosed: “methodological nationalism.” Exceptionalism explains what the
United States does in the world by isolating its “culture,” “character,” or
“institutions” from wider relations, thus explaining outcomes by reference to
internal factors alone. 8
On this count, exceptionalism’s mode of explanation bears similarities
to traditional “metropolitan-centered” explanations of imperial expansion.
Metropolitan-centered explanations explain what empires do in terms of what
imperialists do and who they are. They explain colonial policies or impe-
rial projects by reference to events, actors, institutions, or characters in the
6

See data on rates of colonization in the world system in Bergesen and Schoenberg (1980).
This mode of thought thus bears similarity to other arguments regarding “national character,”
such as the argument first articulated by David Hume who observed that European colonial
practices in the Americas reflected each European nation’s individual style and culture. Hume
said: “the same set of manners will follow a nation, and adhere to them over the whole globe,
as well as the same laws and languages. The Spanish, English, French and Dutch colonies are all
distinguishable even between the tropics,” quoted in Elliot (2006), p. xiv.
On “methodological nationalism,” see Wimmer and Schiller (2002) and Chernilo (2006).240
Patterns of Empire
imperial nation. They account for imperial dynamics by reference to imperial
policy makers; they explain imperial exploitation by reference to metropolitan
capitalists’ tendencies; they reduce acts of imperial benevolence or liberality
to imperial rulers’ character or the imperial states’ political institutions. They
even explain imperial success or failure by reference to imperialists’ sole agency.
The pro-empire neo-revisionist commentator Niall Ferguson urges Americans
to own up to America’s imperial tendencies but only so that it might be a better
empire. The implicit assumption is that American empire would be successful
if only Americans had the proper will and commitment; as if empire succeeds
or fails based on the imperialists themselves. 9
Historians Robinson and Gallagher long ago mounted an assault against
such metropolitan-centered thinking. To understand why Britain expanded
in the late nineteenth century, they urged, we have to look beyond forces at
home and instead attend to dynamics in the periphery where colonization was
actually taking place. As opposed to a metrocentric explanation, they proposed
an “excentric” one. 10 This was meant for investigating the causes of Britain’s
new imperialism in the late nineteenth century, but its general principle can be
applied to more than just imperial expansion. It can be enlisted to transcend
exceptionalism’s explanations of imperial forms and practices – as well as its
portrayal of empire more broadly.
In explaining what the United States does by reference to a presumably
unique American “national character,” exceptionalism portrays empires as
entities with special characteristics or styles rooted in the imperial nations’
values, institutions, and traditions. It thus paints empires as monolithic states
whose policies and practices are determined by those essential characteristics.
Empires are shaped from within. The evidence marshaled in this book offers
a different approach entirely. First, rather than seeing empires as monolithic
essences, it seems them as imperial formations with potentially conflicting ten-
dencies, tactics and techniques, and multiple modalities of power that do not
always add up to a coherent style or singular character. Across the empire at
any given point in time, a variety of policies and practices are mobilized; over
time they are substituted, replaced, transferred, or modified, and the impe-
rial formation as a whole undergoes shifts, transformations, extensions, and
contractions. In both America’s colonial empire and Britain’s colonial empire,
there were a variety of colonial regimes and governmentalities, ranging from
paternalistic protection to tutelary assimilation; both imperial states deployed
informal mechanisms of influence in other parts of the world; and both states
later substituted some direct methods for indirect ones while undergoing var-
ious historical waves of aggression in the longer run. One is hard pressed to
find homogeneity or national essences here.
Second, rather than seeing empires as shaped only from within, the analysis
in this book sees empires as located in wider global fields of conflict and

241
competition as they reach across, through, and down to more localized settings
of power relations. Embedded in and moving about these fields and power
relations, empires are in turn shaped by them. They project their power on
a global scale, but adapt their techniques and forms to better suit the global
fields they seek to dominate. They rule natives but sometimes also “go native,”
adapting themselves to local conditions and to the spaces and places they seek
to rule – if only to better rule them. 11 And they sometimes shift, redirect, or
modify their imperial policies and practices depending on the character of the
local fields in which they operate and the place they occupy within those fields.
Imperial formations change over time, and their changes depend in part on
the dynamics of the wider arena and the imperial states’ position in it. To be
sure, as seen in Chapter 6, during both their periods of hegemony, the U.S. and
British empires preferred “informal” imperialism and adopted seemingly “anti-
imperial” promarket stances resulting from their hegemonic status. Here, the
two empires did what they did partly because of the wider relations in which
they were embedded and, even more importantly, their dominant place within
those relations. Sitting at the apex of the global system, they had an interest
in abating their aggression and shifting toward informal tactics. The structural
position of the empire at the time – not its internal character or culture, its
institutions or traditions – helps explain the empires’ activities.
In sum, as opposed to methodological nationalism and metropolitan-
centered theories, the approach to empire culled from this book emphasizes
various scales of determination beyond the imperial nation itself. Exceptional-
ism’s analysis of national essences must be replaced with an analysis of local
and global relations. 12
The point is not to discard metropolitan determinants entirely. Colonial
agents overseas will carry some influences with them as they craft policies
and strategize on the ground. In the imperial state itself there are a variety
of actors, from presidents and prime ministers to parliamentarians and con-
gressmen, judges and jurists – all of whom reside within the metropole, and so
will be influenced to some degree by what happens there (including, in some
cases, domestic public opinion). Ultimately, imperial policies have to be forged
by actors in the metropole. 13 But this book has tried to show that sometimes
metropolitan factors in themselves are not determinant; that nonmetropolitan
factors must also be taken into account. It has tried to show that sometimes non-
metropolitan factors can matter more than domestic forces, if only to influence
11

This might apply not only to the U.S. or British empire, but probably also to other empires as
well, from the French to the Ottoman to the Russian. See especially for the Ottoman empire
Barkey (2008); for the Russian empire, see Lieven (2002). For an impressive macro comparative
view, see Cooper and Burbank (2010).
In social science parlance, the epistemology of exceptionalist thought exemplifies “essentialism,”
whereas the approach in this book adopts “relationalism.” On essentialism versus relationalism
in sociology, see Emirbayer (1997).
For an examination of domestic factors shaping foreign policy that does not fall prey to excep-
tionalist thought, see Zelizer (2010).242
Patterns of Empire
exactly what policies and imperial programs actors in the metropole formulate
and enact.
The point, then, is not to hastily discount the possibility that metropolitan
forces matter. It is to challenge the exceptionalist assumption that those fac-
tors amount to a singular essence or character. Rather than a singular political
culture or set of monolithic political beliefs and values, it is more likely that
the United States, as with Britain before, has had tendencies within it of both
imperialism and anti-imperialism, of benign posturing and ruthless exploita-
tion, of liberal governmentality and more illiberal tyranny – as well as shades
in between. Why one tendency becomes more dominant rather than another,
why empires formulate one policy or deploy one modality and not the other –
such things are likely the result of a host of factors, rather than just factors
within the metropole. In the story told in previous chapters, we have seen some
of those factors (not least the particular structure of the field in which the
empires happened to be operating and the empires’ place in the overarching
global structure).
The related point, finally, is not to entirely discount metropolitan determi-
nants, but instead overturn the still-dominant exceptionalist assumption that
everything that happens flows outward from the metropole, as if power were
only a one-way street, as if empires can be analytically extracted from the spaces
they inhabit or the peoples they dominate. Empires might wish for these things.
But global structures can overwhelm and alter imperial designs; the agency of
subject peoples can thwart, reshape, and transform them too. Our theories
should capture this banality of power; they should reflect the messy realities of
power’s applications. 14 Exceptionalist histories realize in theory what empires
wish for in practice. Our theories can and should do better.
Still, if this book offers a critique of exceptionalism and an alternative ana-
lytic approach to empire, why bother? Is such a critique of exceptionalism still
worth making? The proliferation of empire talk might suggest that exceptional-
ism as a mode of thought has already reached its limits, that exceptionalism at
best is a specter that haunts lesser minds only. Yet the stubborn persistence of
exceptionalist themes in some sectors of scholarship suggests otherwise. Even
as an increasing number of scholars treat American empire as worthy of exami-
nation, skeptics remain. 15 Besides, admitting the existence of American empire
does not in itself overthrow exceptionalism as an analytic framework. The
notion of an exceptional American empire endures, as does the explanatory
regime that lends primacy to metropolitan factors. Exceptionalism remains a
deep and powerful mode of thought in scholarly investigation: Even some crit-
ics of exceptionalism (and, for that matter, critics of American imperialism) do
not always challenge its foundations. For example, some criticisms claim that

On the “banality of power” in the African postcolonial context, see Mbembe (1992).
See, for instance, the refusal to see the United States as an “empire” in Suri (2009); others refuse
to stake a claim either way (e.g., Maier [2006]). For a recent reinscription of exceptionalism
for understanding U.S. development, see Rauchway (2006).Conclusion

American imperialism has not been benign and virtuous, if only because it was
not benign and virtuous in the first place (rather exploitative, racist, and vio-
lent), or because true American “ideals” and “character” have been corrupted
by imperialism. 16 As the diametric opposite of exceptionalist thought, these
criticisms risk carrying its problematic assumption that empires first and fore-
most express the national character of the metropole or the will of its people.
Agency is reserved for the imperialists.
Exceptionalism remains powerful outside scholarship too. Everyday lan-
guage is filled with talk of an “American way.” Perhaps by the same token,
exceptionalist themes continue to shape foreign policy. Donald Kagan (Yale
historian and formerly of the influential policy group called “Project for the
New American Century”) insists that “all comparisons between America’s cur-
rent place in the world and anything legitimately called an empire in the past
reveal ignorance and confusion about any reasonable meaning of the concept
empire.” 17 Furthermore, recent U.S. presidents from Reagan to Bush the Elder
to Bush the Younger have shown themselves to be believers in American excep-
tionalism, and their beliefs have probably provided some of the ideological
arsenal for American military interventions. At the very least, exceptionalism
has underpinned American hubris. 18 “America is a Nation with a mission,”
declared George W. Bush in his Inaugural Address of 2004, still amidst the
second Iraq War, “and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs. We
have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of empire.”
Pundits have wondered whether President Barack Obama is a “post-
imperial” president. 19 But we might also wonder: Is he a post-exceptionalist
president too? Consider his major speech on foreign affairs, titled “A New
Beginning,” given in 2009. On the one hand, President Obama reiterates
exceptionalist denials of empire: “America is not the crude stereotype of a
self-interested empire. The United States has been one of the greatest sources of
progress that the world has ever known. We were born out of revolution against
an empire. We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we
have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words –
within our borders, and around the world.” On the other hand, elsewhere in
the speech, the president admits to America’s role in the overthrow of Iranian
16

William Appleman Williams argues that American foreign policy has been guided by “three
ideals”: (1) a “humanitarian impulse,” (2) “the principle of self-determination,” and (3) the idea
that foreign societies should “improve their lives.” The “tragedy,” however, is that American
foreign policy has failed to live up to these ideals in practice: “America’s humanitarian urge
to assist other peoples is undercut – even subverted – by the way it goes about helping them.”
Williams (1972), pp. 13, 15.
Kagan (2002)
President George W. Bush’s speech in 2004 to the Philippine Congress justifying the Iraq War
and continued U.S. military support of Manila’s campaign against Islamic separatists in the
southern Philippines is but one example. On exceptionalism’s influence on American human
rights policy, see Ignatieff (1995).
Zakaria (2009).244
Patterns of Empire
president Mohammed Mosaddiq in 1953. “For many years, Iran has defined
itself in part by its opposition to my country, and there is indeed a tumultuous
history between us. In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played
a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government.” 20
Here Obama figures as a revisionist exceptionalist, or perhaps even a liberal
exceptionalist. By referring to the overthrow in 1953, he admits America’s
imperial tendencies. Yet he also insists on America’s potential for a benevolent
imperialism based on America’s national character and founding ideals.
President Obama’s liberal exceptionalism is strikingly resonant with the
exceptionalist discourse seen throughout this book. Also resonant is the fact
that his speech was given in Cairo, Egypt. This was where, in 1882, some
20,000 British troops also stood, having mounted an assault on the Suez Canal
and seized Cairo. British troops would occupy the country for another seventy-
two years. President Obama’s speech did not refer to that. Nor did it refer to
the fact that Obama would soon call for additional troops to be deployed in
Afghanistan where British troops had also been, multiple times. In 1878, for
example, just four years before the invasion of Egypt, British commanders led
close to 40,000 forces into Afghanistan from three different points, beginning
an attack that led to an occupation, an apparent peace, and then an unexpected
anti-British uprising that left the British envoy killed. This summoned the return
of British forces soon after. Although the British did not remain too long, they
did return again to Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, alongside American
troops. The world’s past and present hegemonic empires have not only been
similar, they continue to be conjoined.
But for how long? Britain’s imperial determination has already abated. In
December 2010, a year after President Obama gave his speech in Cairo, the new
British prime minister, David Cameron, vowed not to deploy any more British
troops in Afghanistan, thus declaring Britain’s imminent withdrawal. 21 Con-
versely, America’s imperial activities persist. As 2010 approached, President
Obama vowed to increase the number of American soldiers in Afghanistan.
He called upon 21,000 more to join the fight. He also called for enhanced
operations in neighboring areas in Pakistan. His justification should be eerily
familiar: “[W]e will use all elements of our national power to defeat al Qaeda,
and to defend America, our allies, and all who seek a better future. Because the
United States of America stands for peace and security, justice and opportunity.
That is who we are, and that is what history calls on us to do once more.” 22
This marks a persistent if not stubborn empire. It also marks an enduring
exceptionalism upon which the sun has not yet set.

This is frightening. If the story in this book tells us something, it is that
empires that insist on their exceptionality do not behave well. And self-
fashioned exceptional empires that are falling behave worse still. In this sense,
our affair in Iraq and Afghanistan may just be a portent. Something more is
coming.Appendix
Notes on Data
Time-series data on British annexations come from the compendium by Stewart
(1996). This lists every territory annexed by Britain since 1493 with the initial
date of annexation. It also provides brief historical information on each terri-
tory. This data is more robust than the data from Henige (1970) that has been
typically used in world-system analyses of colonization. Henige lists colonial
governors appointed by all states. Scholars have used the data as a rough mea-
sure of the year when a new colony was annexed, corresponding with the year
when the first colonial governor was appointed. The shortcoming is that the
data does not differentiate between territories that are newly acquired and ter-
ritories that are renamed or reorganized. Alternatively, Stewart’s book enables
us to ascertain the year when Britain first annexed a territory and thus treat it
as a single event. Stewart’s book provides the name of each territory and year
of founding while providing a brief historical overview. The overview enables
the analyst to ascertain whether the territory had been previously colonized by
Britain or not. If it had been, it would not be counted in the data as a new
colonial annexation. Conversely, Henige’s data would include when a colony
that has already been taken is simply reorganized or renamed.
Data on British military interventions are compiled from the following
sources: (Clowes 1903), (Farmer 1984[1901]), (Harris 1944), (Kohler 1975),
and Public Record Office files (ADM 171–1, “Naval General Service Medal
1793–1840”; ADM 171/202: “Naval Medals and Clasps Awarded from 1818
to 1914”). Information from these sources is necessary for supplementing infor-
mation in traditional war databases such as the Correlates of War data in Singer
(1987), which only lists large-scale interstate wars. Because of data limitations,
the data begins in 1800 only. “Military intervention” includes small wars, big
wars, and troop or naval deployments. Small operations involving slave raiding
or infrastructural building are not included. The data is coded to specify the
year the intervention began. Each intervention is treated as a single event, so
repeated deployments of troops for the same engagement are not added; only
the initiation of the event is entered.

Appendix: Notes on Data
For the United States, data on colonial annexations are compiled from
Goertz and Diehl (1992), Henige (1970), and Tir et al. (1998). Data on U.S.
military interventions come from Collier (1993) and Grimmett (2004). These
are lists complied by the State Department and Foreign Affairs and National
Defense Division of the Library of Congress. They cover “instances of the use
of United States forces abroad” covering, together, the years 1798 to 2004.
The list represents “a judgment as to which US armed interventions overseas
represented major military actions” and provides, for each action, a date and
a very brief description [see (United States Congress Committee on Foreign
Affairs 1970), p. 15]. The actions include official and undeclared wars, naval
operations and uses of air force, troop deployments and land invasions, and
provision of direct military support to other nations. It excludes the opera-
tions of the U.S. military in the western frontier. To cover the years prior to
1798, I used various secondary sources. Number of covert operations/subverted
elections comes from data in “Basic Statistics for United States Imperialism”

Yugoslavia, 198–200‘expansive’ use of steam.	watt	steam
 Rather than steam pushing the engine’s piston through its entire stroke, Watt realized that as steam has a natural propensity to expand, it would continue to push the piston even if the supply to the cylinder was shut off early.	watt	cylinder
 The engine was also redesigned to make it ‘double-acting’; that is, steam not only pushed the piston down, but up as well, combining with the effect of the sun and planet gear to provide the smooth, constant power output essential if the engine was to be used by textile mills.	steam	engine
 The final major improvement was to find a new way of attaching the piston to the beam.	beam	
 The old atmos- pheric engines only required strong wrought-iron chains for the piston to pull down upon.	engine	engines
 But with double action the piston’s upward stroke would simply double up the chains.		
 To get around this, Watt developed his ‘parallel motion’, a parallelogram of metal rods that provided a flexible but resisting connection between the piston rod and beam.	watt	beam
 Watt was particularly proud of its graceful motion, calling it ‘one of the most ingenious, simple pieces of mechanism I have ever contrived’.	watt	
 The first of Boulton & Watt’s rotative engines set running outside Soho was built for John Wilkinson in 1783, and by 1800, they had built 278 as opposed to 171 pumping engines.	watt	engines
 Boulton & Watt’s customer list reflects the rotative engine’s utility in a wide range of tasks.	watt	engine
 Customers included lead works, rope works, malt distilleries, sugar, tobacco and snuff manufactories, druggists, rolling mills, forges and foundries, glazers, bark and cork mills, even a mustard manufacturer.	forge	
 So Boulton & Watt’s engine was in considerable demand from customers spread broadly across Britain, and three- quarters of English counties had one at work.	watt	engine
 There were also large concentrations of engines working in relatively small areas, and one of the greatest of these was in Lancashire, with 44 engines erected by Boulton & Watt for cotton mills, along with eleven more in other industries.	watt	cotton
 But not all was as the raw numbers suggest.		
 Boulton & Watt’s rotative beam engine was a highly effective machine, but there was not necessarily a clear-cut link between steam power and production.	watt	machine
 Potential customers’ power requirements varied considerably.		
 james watt 152 Overwhelmingly the demand for power – of any type, steam or water – was for small units.	watt	steam
 For many producers, remaining small offered distinct advantages: less risk of overcapacity in a downturn, the ability to more easily change production to suit markets.		
 Sheer size ‘guaran - teed neither efficiency in good times nor viability in bad’.		
 Even where a factory was big, it was not necessarily power-hungry: Boulton’s Soho Manufactory and Wedgwood’s Etruria works used steam for some processes, but many of their workshops demanded no more power than could be provided by a foot treadle or a kickwheel.	watt	workshop
 It was common, where a large mill building was constructed, only to grad - ually fill it with machinery, or even sublet space to different companies, offering ‘room and power’ in return for rent.	machine	
 The average Boulton & Watt engine built before 1800 developed only 15 horsepower.	watt	horsepower
 So, potential customers for their rotative engine wanted power, if they wanted it at all, on a small scale.	watt	beam

 Many prospective customers were also very timid in their approach to power.		
 Although they might have had experience of production driven by waterwheels or even horses, they were less likely than miners or colliery owners to have prior experience with any sort of steam engine, meaning they needed more guidance in commis- sioning and operating new plant.	steam	waterwheel
 They could be led astray by engine builders like the two Matthew Boulton described as ‘drunken, idle, stupid, careless, conceited rascals [who] say, and their masters seem to believe, that it required the learning and knowledge of a University man to keep an engine in order’.	boulton	engine
 There was less enthu- siasm for adopting an efficient but relatively unproven Watt engine if there was any chance of it being less than entirely reliable.	watt	engine
 Best to rely on a tried and tested alternative.		
 Often that alternative was a variant of Newcomen’s atmospheric engine.	engine	
 This could be connected to a crank and flywheel to make a rotative motion; it might not work very evenly, due to the engine’s single-acting cycle, but could sometimes be made more so by using a heavy weight on the flywheel to act as a counter to the engine’s power ful downstroke.	engine	flywheel
 Or, more simply, an atmospheric engine could be used alongside a waterwheel, recirculating water from below the wheel to a reservoir above it.	engine	waterwheel
 If the water supply was reli- able, the engine might need to be used only in the event of a summer drought.	engine	
 Both these schemes found favour because manufacturers accepted the atmospheric engine’s higher fuel consumption as a price worth paying for simple and reliable operation.	engine	
 In advance of developing their sun and planet engine, even Boulton & Watt’s ‘Old Bess’ engine was used at their Soho Manufactory to recirculate water over a wheel, and John Wilkinson had one at his ironworks, ‘an engine of great magnitude which brought up the contents of the river as it were at one stroke’, that ‘shook the buildings and ground for a considerable distance’.	watt	iron
 Further, waterwheels remained a serious proposition for many prospective customers.	waterwheels	waterwheel
 They were by no means a crude alternative to steam power.	steam	waterwheel
 The same year that Watt patented his separate condenser, 1769, John Smeaton was beginning to apply cast-iron compon ents to a wheel at the Carron Foundry in Scotland, which was ‘found to answer much better than wooden ones’ and was james watt 154 ‘constantly recommended afterwards by Mr Smeaton for other mills which he designed, and by degrees came into very general use’.	watt	smeaton
 By substitution of cast iron, careful testing and design, Smeaton doubled the waterwheel’s efficiency.	smeaton	iron
 The capabilities of waterwheels are suggested by one that Jabez Fisher saw at Stockport, 40 feet in diameter but so finely poised that it was ‘turned by about as much water as could go out of a Pint Mug’.	waterwheels	stockport
 A waterwheel like that installed at Arkwright’s Cromford mill might generate 12 horsepower but, by 1800, wheels of 80 horsepower were in use.	arkwright	horsepower
 In the following decades, they reached 100, even 200 horsepower – far more than the steam engines then available.	arkwright	horsepower
 These developments reduced the incentive to adopt steam power.	steam	
 If they wished to purchase an engine, customers need not turn just to Boulton & Watt: there were many other competing firms.	watt	engine
 Some, like Matthew Murray in Leeds, presented a major challenge, being ‘the first to set an example to Boulton and Watt themselves in that superior finish to the steam-engine which has now become general’.	watt	steam
 In Manchester the company of Bateman & Sherratt was acknowledged as having ‘very ingenious and able’ engineers who built engines that were ‘of a small size, very compact, stand in a small space, work smooth and easy, and are scarcely heard in the build- ing where erected’.	manchester	engineer
 Others were less of a threat: an engine built by Ebenezer Smith and Co. was described by James Lawson, an engine erector for Boulton & Watt, as ‘one of the worse made I ever saw’.	watt	engine
 As in scientific instrument making, there was room alongside the very best for those building machines that were just sufficient for the job in hand.	instrument	machine
 John Farey recorded that in the early 1790s ‘great numbers’ of old atmospheric engines were being constructed to drive mills on account of the cheap coal available locally: ‘These engines answered the purposes for which they were applied, and were used for many years.	engine	engines
 ’49 It is telling, then, that Manchester 155 steam mill mad?.	manchester	steam
 1781–95 writer John Aikin recorded that only ‘some few [engines] are also erected in this neighbourhood by Messrs Bolton and Watts’ [sic].	watt	neighbour
 So, although Matthew Boulton predicted that rotative engines presented ‘a field that is boundless’, this declaration did not neces - sarily transpose into orders for engines.	boulton	engines
 Boulton & Watt’s engine, for all its technical prowess, was one of a number of potential options which could be provided by a range of different suppliers.	watt	engine
 Out of more than 2,000 engines built in Britain by 1800, two-thirds were of the older atmospheric type, and Boulton & Watt built only one- quarter.	watt	engines
 What mattered more to their customers than the sheer scale and the type of power source used was the modernity and ingenuity of the machinery that it drove.	machine	
 This was reflected in the contrast, noted by visitors to Manchester, between the smoke and confusion outside the mills, which was in large part produced by steam engines, and the precision mechanical movements of the production machinery within.	manchester	machine
 One of visitors’ abiding memories of Manchester was its ‘dark black smoaky atmosphere’, the product of a growing number of chimneys, each connected to a boiler for raising steam.	manchester	steam
 In 1786 there was only a single chimney in the town but by 1801 there were more than 50 and, visiting the town in 1802, Eric Svedenstierna was moved to write how ‘in order to carry away the coal-smoke, the chimneys at most of the mills are taken up high above the roofs.		
 ’54 Together they supplied the town with a constant fug of smoke, ‘an inky canopy which seemed to embrace and involve the entire place’.		
 Alongside the polluted atmosphere, Manchester at street level must have been an assault on visitors’ senses; in 1835 Alexis de Tocqueville described ‘the crunching wheels of machinery, the shriek of steam from boilers, the regular beat of the looms, the heavy rumble of carts’ as ‘the noises from which you can never escape in the sombre half- light of these streets’.	manchester	machine
 If the external effects of engines were the subject of negative comment, the machinery inside, by comparison, left a very favourable impression on those who saw it.	engine	machine
 In 1782 an anonymous author wrote that ‘those who are lovers of invention, and fond of mechanical im provements, must admire the ingenuity of the cotton mills and the engines lately erected in the neighbourhood of Manchester’.	manchester	neighbour
 james watt 156 In 1786 Joseph Smith & Robert Peel of Manchester summed up the main advantage of the English cotton trade as arising ‘from our machines both for spinning and printing; by means of these we can spin both cheaper and better, and we can print . . . cheaper and better’.	watt	cheaper
 And from a slightly later vantage point Edward Baines attributed to cotton machines ‘as great a revolution in manufactures as the art of printing effected in literature’.	revolution	machine
 Britain became the world’s principal textile manufacturer by solving the mechanical problems of production – and that was most evident among the whirring shafts and spinning flyers inside the mills.	britain	
 A question arises, then, over who the people were to best deliver this modern, mechanical world.		
 Earlier chapters have explored the links between blacksmithing, instrument making and early machine making.	instrument	machine
 Another major source of engineering skill was among millwrights.	engine	engineer
 This class of men emerged to design and construct windmills and watermills, pumping machines and ‘all the various kinds of rough machinery in use’ into the nineteenth century.	machines	machine
 A vivid description of the millwright has been provided by William Fairbairn.		
 He characterized the millwright as a ‘jack-of-all-trades, who could with equal facility work at the lathe, the anvil, or the carpenter’s bench . . . he thus gained the character of an ingenious, roving, rollicking blade, able to turn his hand to anything’.	lathe	
 Millwrighting was originally a peripatetic job, and millwrights, ‘like other wandering tribes . . . went about the country from mill to mill, with the old song of “kettles to mend” reapplied to the more important fractures of machinery’.	machine	
 However, as the eighteenth century progressed, more millwrights were employed at a single site.		
 Fairbairn was apprenticed to the Northumberland millwright John Robinson, who maintained all the machines working at a colliery and who, perhaps because of his wide responsibilities, had a ‘rough, passionate temper’ and ‘indulged in . . . profane swearing, carried to such an excess that an order was scarcely once given unless accompanied by an oath’.	machines	machine
 Elsewhere Fairbairn notes the existence of Millwrights’ Institutes in public houses, where drink and disagree - ment over points of practical science led to members imparting knowledge with a fist aimed at ‘the sensitive parts of the body, instead of appealing to the higher organs of intellect’.	ment	science
 157 steam mill mad?.	steam	
 1781–95 Such men, at once foul-mouthed, belligerent and highly skilled, found themselves drawn in two directions.		
 Engines like Watt’s, which required precision manufacture, needed the facilities of a dedi cated works, making use of specialized equipment like cylinder-boring machines and lathes.	watt	machine
 In these places the millwright became sub - sumed into the machine making profession alongside engineers, turners and fitters, working alongside carpenters, wheelwrights, cabinetmakers, joiners, smiths, clockmakers and others attracted from their original trades by better wages.	engine	engineer
 However, a second path allowed mill wrights to retain a distinct identity: the engine (or other power source) still had to be assembled on site, and its power trans- mitted to the production machinery that it drove.	engine	machine
 This remained the millwright’s specialized domain.		
 In fact those writing in the early nineteenth century pointed to Watt’s engine and Arkwright’s cotton-spinning machines as leading to the advance in millwork, making the expert millwright more indispensable than ever.	watt	machine
 The millwright’s particular job was to construct the shafts and wheels known as ‘mill-work’, needed to couple a power source to the production machinery.	machine	
 This entailed planning out the entire scheme, calculating the proportions and strength of the individual parts and determining the arrangement of the machinery.	machine	
 The mill- work was required to be strong, stiff and ‘easy of repair’.		
 Fairbairn recalls rising with the sun in summer, and some hours before it in the winter . . . For the remainder of the day I had either to draw out the work, or to ride fifteen or sixteen miles on a hired hack to consult with proprietors, take dimensions, and arrange the principle and plan on which the work was to be constructed.		
 Practical work was matched by skill at negotiation and draughts- manship as well.		
 All was underpinned by the millwright’s ability to manipulate materials.		
 At first, they worked mainly with timber, forming ‘large square shafts and wooden drums, some of them 4 feet in diam- eter’ but this, with other associated pieces of mechanism, ‘not only crowded the rooms, but seriously obstructed the light where most james watt 158 required, in the more delicate and refined operations of the different machines’.	watt	machine
 Wood began to be replaced with metal to better withstand the higher speeds at which the machinery was required to operate; bulky millwork was shrunk, the ‘ponderous masses of wood, cast iron, and their enormous bearings and couplings’ giving way to ‘slender rods of wrought iron and light frames or hooks for sus- pending them, [and] pulleys and straps of moderate diameters and dimensions’.	iron	machine
 So, the means of building the internal systems of a mill were provided by the millwright, using many of the techniques used to construct engines that we have earlier discussed.	engine	engines
 But alongside them worked a second distinct group of workmen, from the world of clockmaking.	engine	clockmaking
 As the eighteenth century progressed, and possession of a time- keeper became as much a mark of social standing as it was a record of timekeeping per se, horology was a growing trade.		
 It was also highly skilled, requiring ‘no great strength’ but ‘a mechanic head, a light nice hand; and a strong sight, there being scarce any trade which requires a quicker eye or steadier hand’.		
 These factors attracted James Watt, who took an interest in clockmaking alongside his other 159 steam mill mad?.	watt	clockmaking

 projects.		
 He and his friend William Small were exchanging notes on a new design of clock in 1771, with Small telling Watt how ‘I have perfected my clock with one wheel of nine inch diameter, which is to tell hours, minutes, and seconds, and strike, and repeat, and be made for thirty shillings.	watt	
 ’73 And even before that, in 1758, Watt was in partnership with Joseph Black and Alexander Wilson to make clocks – his workshop contains an incomplete timepiece movement and a number of unfinished clockwheels that may date from this period.	watt	partnership
 How clockmaking was organized varied across Britain.	britain	clockmaking
 At one end of the scale were the makers based in London.	makers	
 The metropolis was home to a complex trade exporting finished clocks all over the world, comprising large numbers of specialized workers – Abraham Rees counted up to eighteen different trades – movement makers, spring makers, enamellers, brass founders and more.	trades	brass
 The move- ments, springs, chains and cases were all manufactured by different tradesmen, though it was the watchmaker who ‘puts his name upon the plate, and is esteemed the maker, though he ha[d] not made in his shop the smallest wheel belonging to it’.	ment	trades
 In contrast to the London trade stood those making clocks who might have been trained as blacksmiths and in associated trades, build ing locks or even firearms.	trades	
 Their biggest products would have been large ‘turret’ clocks intended for churches and other places from where the time was told by the wider public.		
 These clocks were accurate timepieces but, owing to their physical size, their construction owed as much to the blacksmith as to the bench-based clockmaker.	clockmaker	
 For this reason, these self-contained and multi-skilled tradesmen have sometimes been called ‘clocksmiths’.	tradesmen	trades
 The nature of the clocksmith’s workshop reflected their combin - ation of skills.	workshop	trades
 It would ideally admit as much natural light as possible, to illuminate intricate work such as polishing, engraving and mark- ing out clock dials.	workshop	
 The bench would be positioned close to the window and, if very small work was carried out there regularly, might have a groove along its front and ‘wings’ around the sides to catch com pon ents rolling off.		
 For very small work, wineglasses broken off at the stem were traditionally used, turned upside down, to protect delicate components placed beneath them while a mechanism was 161 steam mill mad?.	steam	
 1781–95 dismantled.		
 But alongside the bench for small work, the workshop would also contain much shared with the blacksmith: ‘forge, bellows, anvil, tongs, hammers, screwplate and taps, bench and hand vices, drills, and pliers’.	workshop	
 The forge might be placed in a separate, darker room, or as far away from the window as possible, the better to accu- rately gauge the colour and working temperature of the metalwork being heated upon it.	forge	
 The presence of the forge is a reminder of the need to heat materials so that they could be shaped.	forge	
 Much clocksmith’s work was carried out in brass, rolled into sheets or cast into columns, gear- wheels or plates.	brass	
 The plates would then be hammered flat using a round-faced planishing hammer to avoid leaving sharp indentations before hand-filing to a smooth finish: brass can be ‘work-hardened’ – that is, the more it is worked, with a hammer, file or in the lathe, the tougher it becomes.	lathe	brass
 Wrought iron would be used to fabricate larger clock frames and movements, the pieces being heated and shaped using hammers and an anvil, and held together by nuts and bolts or wedges driven through holes.	iron	
 The clocksmith had to carefully consider the relationship between these different materials.		
 Components bearing onto each other, like clock-wheels and the smaller pinion wheels which connected them, were usually of different materials, brass for the former and steel for the latter.	brass	
 This reduced the amount of friction generated and used the stronger material where the strains imposed by the clock mech- anism were largest.		
 Although it was less easily shaped than brass, steel was cheaper: in the early eighteenth century it might cost one penny per pound compared to ten pence for brass.	brass	cheaper
 So clocksmiths were prepared to use steel to save money on materials, even if it took longer to work, and it was sometimes employed for parts that were hidden away inside the mechanism, unseen.	clocksmiths	
 Alongside tools like hammers and files, which might be found across a variety of trades, clocksmiths were early in adopting special-purpose tools.	clocksmiths	tools
 The latter were particularly useful in making the gear wheels, often referred to as ‘wheel-work’, that much of a clock movement consisted of.		
 In a relatively small movement, these wheels were often stamped out of brass: material was removed to save weight, leaving spokes behind.	brass	
 Then teeth were cut into the james watt 162 circumference in two stages: a wheel-cut
