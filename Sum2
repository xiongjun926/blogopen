A World Transformed The nineteenth century marked one of the great watersheds in human beings  power over the world around them
In many basic ways, daily life in the eigh- teenth century differed little from that in ancient times
People still relied on  their own muscles or on those of horses or oxen to carry their loads and pull  their plows; on the wind to drive the sails of their ships; and on falling water  to turn their mill wheels and grind their grain
Some fi rst efforts had been  made to harness the power of steam, but before 1780 it was used for little more  than pumping water out of mines in (1)(2) Communications, too, had  changed little for centuries: a message could still travel no faster than the per- son who carried it, and a traveler in 1780 typically took two months to cover  the 900 miles from Rome to London, and anywhere from three weeks to three  months to cross the (1)(2)
Jump forward a little more than a century, say to 1910, and we fi nd a very  different world
Steam engines now drive giant factories, and networks of elec- trical lines spread power and light throughout the worlds cities
Railroads and  steamships have turned crossing a continent or an ocean from a perilous jour- ney of weeks or months into a routine trip of a few days
The fi rst automobiles  have begun to appear on the roads and the fi rst airplanes in the skies
Com- munication has not just been sped up but has become almost instantaneous:  a vast web of telegraph cables circles the globe, and telephone lines carry the  sound of distant voices right into peoples homes
Wireless telegraphy has be - gun to emerge from its infancy, and the advent of radio broadcasting is already  in sight
Along with these sweeping changes in the technologies of daily life, the  nineteenth century also witnessed striking advances in scientifi c understand- ing
Charles Darwins theory of evolution is the best known of these, but the  physical sciences made great strides as well, particularly in the study of energy,  atoms, and electromagnetism
The scale and organization of the scientifi c en - terprise also changed dramatically, as science came to be recognized as a pro- fession and was increasingly pursued by legions of specialists working in great research laboratories and university departments
By the opening decades of  the twentieth century, science and technology had become in many ways the  defi ning features of modern life
One of the most persistent and important questions in the study of both  science and technology is that of the relationship between the two
Is technol- ogy simply “applied science,” with scientists making all of the original dis- coveries and inventors and engineers then straightforwardly applying them to  practical purposes
Or are scientifi c discoveries themselves largely by-products  of the demands and opportunities presented by advancing technologies
Is the  course of technological development determined chiefl y by the course of pre- vious scientifi c discovery, or is it the other way around
Many people have tried to defi ne “science” and “technology” and to mark  out the exact differences between them
None of these attempts have proven  entirely satisfac tory, and we should be wary of trying to defi ne our way to an  answer; however precise and carefully drawn our defi nitions, it will remain an  open question whether they really capture what people mean when they use  the words science and technology
It is nonetheless useful to draw a general dis- tinction between the two, and perhaps the best is one of the simplest: broadly  speaking, science is about knowing, while technology is about doing
Of course  we often need to do a lot (with experiments and apparatus) to be able to know much, and we often need to know a lot (in the sense both of specifi c facts and  of skills or “know-how”) to be able to do much, but this still leaves us with a  broad distinction in aims and focus
The remaining overlap between know- ing and doing refl ects what seems to be a real overlap between science and   technology
The English philosopher and statesman Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) fa - mously declared that “knowledge is power
” He also said that researchers ought  to pursue “experi ments of light, as well as of fruit,” that is, experiments aimed  at producing disinterested knowledge or enlightenment, as well as ones aimed  at producing direct profi t or benefi t
¹ Modern science is partly about the pur- suit of “light” in this sense, but as Bacon suggested, it is also about the pursuit  of practical power, particularly through technology
The interaction between  the pursuit of knowledge and the pursuit of power comes across especially  clearly in two cases drawn from nineteenth-century technology and physics:  the relationship between the development of the steam engine and the study  of heat and energy, and the relationship between the development of the tele- 1

graph and the study of electrical currents and waves
The fi rst of these culmi- nated in the formulation of the laws of thermodynamics—particularly the  grand principles of the conservation of energy and the increase of entropy— and in the development and improvement of new power technologies
The  second culminated in the formulation of fi eld theory and the electromagnetic  theory of light, and in the discovery of radio waves and their use in wireless  communications
Steam and electrical technologies have transformed daily life  over the last two centuries; they also transformed much of science
By examin- ing their history, we will be able to cast light not only on some of the most  important points in the history of modern physics, but also on fundamental  questions about the evolving relationship between science and technology
The nineteenth century was powered by steam
Most of the textile mills that  launched the fi rst wave of the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century  were driven by falling water, but it was steam that would eventually transform  the industrial landscape, fostering the growth of smoky factory cities and pow- ering the locomotives, river boats, and ocean-going ships that revolutionized  transportation
The harnessing of steam was principally the work of engineers  (literally, people who built and ran engines) and only secondarily of scientists
Historians of science and technology have often and quite rightly observed  that the steam engine did much more for science than science ever did for the  steam engine
Many of the builders of the fi rst steam engines were inspired by a scientifi c  view of the world as something to be grasped and controlled, and several of  them made excellent use of scientifi c methods of analysis and measurement
Their achieve ments owed little, however, to any existing stock of scientifi c  knowledge about the connection between heat and work, for little such knowl- edge yet existed; in the eighteenth century, most scientifi c thinkers regarded  heat and work as quite separate subjects
Real scientifi c knowledge of the rela- tionship between the two—what came to be known as thermodynamics—was  attained only several decades into the nineteenth century, as scientists and sci- entifi cally minded engineers sought to understand and improve the workings  of the steam engines they saw proliferating around them
The story of the  steam engine and the birth of thermodynamics provides a clear illustration of  the chief theme of this book: that technology is not simply “applied science”  but has often taken the lead and shaped the development of scientifi c knowl- edge
Power from Steam The expansive power of steam was known in ancient times, and as long ago as  the fi rst century AD, Hero of Alexandria described how jets of steam escaping  from a small boiler could be used to spin a pinwheel
Steam power was not put to much practical use until the late seventeenth century, however, when it  came to be linked both to new ideas about air pressure and the vacuum and to  economic demands for a better way to clear water from deep mines
As coal  mines, and particularly the copper and tin mines of Cornwall in southwestern  England, were carried further below the water table, the difficulty and expense  of pumping them out with human or animal power became overwhelming
Miners had the sense that riches lay just beneath the waters that were con- tinually fl ooding their shafts and tunnels
In the late seventeenth century sev- eral people toyed with ways to use the pressure of steam to pump out the water,  and in the 1690s Thomas Savery, a prolifi c English inventor and “projector”  of speculative schemes, secured a patent on what he called “an engine to raise  water by fi re
”¹ It was an innovative and important device, though it never  quite lived up to Saverys claims for it
Saverys engine consisted of a boiler (a sort of glorifi ed tea kettle), a metal  “receiver” that could hold 10 or 15 gallons of water, a few connecting tubes and  valves, and two pipes, one running down into the water to be pumped out and  the other pointing up to where it was to be discharged
The only moving parts  were the valves used to control the fl ow of steam and water
After fi lling the  receiver with steam from the boiler, the operator closed the connecting valve  and poured cold water over the receiver
This condensed the steam within it  and produced a partial vacuum
The pressure of the surrounding atmosphere  (about 15 pounds per square inch) then pushed water up the lower pipe and  into the partially evacuated receiver, much as when a person sucks water up a  straw
In principle, water could be sucked up as much as 30 feet in this way,  but since the vacuum in the receiver was never perfect, the practical limit was  about 20 feet
Once the receiver was nearly full of water, the operator closed  the valve on the lower pipe, opened one on the upper pipe, and reopened the  valve from the boiler, letting in high-pressure steam that blew the water in the  receiver out through the upper pipe
The operator had to complete the entire  cycle about four times per minute while also tending the fi re under the boiler  and maintaining a supply of cooling water
Saverys claim in his 1702 book The Miners Friend that a boy of 13 could learn to work the engine in half an hour  should perhaps be taken with a grain of salt
Small versions of Saverys steam pump could be made to spurt water very  impress ively, and he erected demonstration engines in London that could raise  50 gallons per minute to a height of nearly 60 feet, the fi rst 16 feet by suction 1
Thomas Savery, The Miners Friend; or, An Engine to Raise Water by Fire (1702; repr, Lon- don: (1) Clawes, 1827)
and the rest by pressure
He found it hard to sustain such performance, how- ever, for the boiler and receiver leaked steam and even threatened to explode  when subjected to the high tempera tures and pressures required to blow the  water out the upper pipe
Although he managed to persuade Parliament to  extend his patent until 1733, Savery was never able to make his engines work  well in a practical setting
Most later Savery engines dispensed with the blow- out stage and worked purely by suction
This made them much simpler and  safer to operate but meant they could raise water no more than 15 or 20 feet,  making them almost useless for their original purpose of clearing water from  deep mines
The fi rst really practical steam engine was developed between 1700 and  1712 by Thomas Newcomen (1663–1729), a maker of iron goods in southwest- ern England who was acutely aware of the Cornish miners need for effective  pumps
How much Newcomen knew about recent scientifi c ideas about air  pressure and the condensation of steam is unclear; indeed, he apparently began  his work without even knowing of Saverys recent invention
He soon showed  himself, however, to be an astute designer and builder of workable machines
In place of Saverys simple but troublesome receiver, Newcomen built his en - gine around a brass cylinder fi tted with a sliding piston, much like that in an  ordinary force pump
When the steam in the cylinder was condensed, the  resulting partial vacuum did not suck water up directly, but instead pulled  down on the piston (or rather, allowed the pressure of the atmosphere to push  down on it), providing enough force to pivot a beam that could then work a  pump or other machinery
By using steam only at low pressures, barely above that of the surrounding  air, Newcomen avoided the danger of bursting boilers that had bedeviled Sav- ery
Indeed, because the actual work in Newcomens engines was done by the  pressure of the atmosphere, his machines were often called “atmospheric  engines”; the steam was used only to produce a partial vacuum when it was  condensed
The cylinder of a typical early Newcomen engine was about two  feet across and eight feet long; after condensation, the pressure within it fell to  seven or eight pounds per square inch, or about half that of the surrounding  atmosphere
With only this reduced internal pressure now opposing the full  weight of the atmosphere that was bearing down on the pistons surface area of  more than three square feet, each stroke delivered a force of nearly two tons,  which could be repeated 15–20 times per minute
The fi rst Newcomen engines  could put out about fi ve horsepower; by the 1780s, the largest could produce  nearly 20 times that
By eighteenth-century standards, a Newcomen engine  was a very powerful machine
To make his engine a practical success, Newcomen had to solve a thousand  small problems, from sealing the piston against seeping air to clearing the cyl- inder of air and water after each cycle
He also devised clever valve gear that  made the whole thing run almost automatically
He was apparently led to one  of his most important improvements by accident: having surrounded the cyl- inder with a jacket full of cooling water to help condense the steam, he was  surprised one day when the piston suddenly slammed down with unusual  force and speed, breaking the connecting machinery
It seems a small leak had  allowed cold water from the surrounding jacket to spray directly into the cyl- inder, condensing the steam within it far more fully and abruptly than the old  method of applying water to the outer surface ever could
Once Newcomen  deliberately adopted it, such cold water injec tion became one of the keys to the  effective operation of his engines
By later standards, Newcomen engines were terribly inefficient
In the  1770s the English engineer John Smeaton (1724–92) carefully measured the  “duty” of various engines—that is, how much work they could perform per  bushel of fuel burned
He had earlier done similar tests of the efficiency of dif- Savery Steam Pump The English inventor Thomas Savery   patented a steam pump in the 1690s that  worked by a combination of suction and  steam pressure
The operator started by  opening a valve and letting steam from a  boiler (F) fi ll a large oval receiver (A)
(The  version shown here had two receivers
) The  operator then sprayed the receiver with  cold water, condensing the steam within it  and creating a partial vacuum that sucked  water up a pipe (C) and through a one- way valve (D) until it fi lled the receiver
A  fresh blast of high-pressure steam from the  boiler then blew the water out of the  receiver, through another valve (B), and  out an upward-pointing pipe
The cycle  was then set to repeat—if the high-  pressure steam had not blown out the  joints on the receiver, as it often did
ferent types of water wheels, and such engineering measurements helped lay  the groundwork for ideas that later became important in physics, particularly  the concept of energy
Smeaton found that for each bushel of coal burned, a  typical Newcomen engine could do work equivalent to raising between 4 and  5 million pounds of water a distance of one foot
By making systematic tests  and modifi cations, he was able to build an engine whose duty approached 10 million pound-feet
This seemed to be about the limit, however, and it meant  it paid to use a Newcomen engine only where it helped produce something of  unusual value, as at a Cornish copper or tin mine, or where its fuel was practi- cally free, as at a coal mine
Of about 700 Newcomen engines known to have  been built in Britain before 1780, over 80 percent were used to pump water  from mines, the great majority being coal mines
² A number of Newcomen  engines were also erected on the European continent, and a few in the Ameri- can colonies, again mainly to pump out mines
The Newcomen engine did not revolutionize the world economy; indeed, Newcomen Steam Engine Thomas Newcomen began building   piston-driven steam engines in the early  1700s
The operator started one of New- comens engines by opening a valve and  letting steam at low pressure pass from a  boiler into a large cylinder fi tted with a  sliding piston; in the version shown here,  the cylinder sat directly above the boiler
A  counterweight attached to a rocking beam  was then able to raise the piston
Once the  piston reached the top of the cylinder, the  operator sprayed cold water into the cylin- der, rapidly condensing the steam inside it
The resulting partial vacuum allowed the  pressure of the surrounding atmosphere to  push down on the upper surface of the pis- ton
The powerful downward stroke of the  piston worked the rocking beam, which was in turn used to drive a pump or other  machinery

it had little immediate impact outside the British mining industry
Newcomen  him self won little acclaim during his lifetime, and few recognized the real  signifi cance of what he had begun
In hindsight, however, it is clear that by  harnessing the power of steam and putting it to practical use, Thomas New- comen had taken one of the fi rst big steps toward building the modern tech- nological world, based on burning fossil fuels, with all of the consequences for  both good and ill that have followed in its train
James Watt James Watt (1736–1819) came along much too late in the development of the  steam engine to deserve the credit he is often given as its “inventor
” Once he  took it up, however, he did more than anyone else to turn the steam engine  into a practical and efficient source of industrial power
Born into a Scottish  family of surveyors and mathematics teachers, Watt had a strong interest in  machines from an early age
In his twenties he set up shop as a maker of scien- tifi c instruments for Glasgow University, and early in 1764 he was asked to  re  pair a model Newcomen engine used in lecture demonstra tions
Though it  had been carefully built to scale, the model burned a disproportionate amount  of fuel and could scarcely be made to run for more than a few strokes at a time
While tinkering with the little engine, Watt became intent not just on repair- ing it, but on understanding its workings and improving its design
He made  careful measurements to track down the cause of its high fuel consumption  and consulted with Joseph Black, the Glasgow professor of medicine and chem- istry, about his recent work on the “latent heat” that seemed to be absorbed  when water was vaporized and then released when steam was condensed
Black  helped Watt clarify his thinking about heat and temperature, but it is clear that  Watts main fi ndings grew out of his own experiments
It had long been known that much of the fuel burned in a Newcomen  engine went simply to heat up its brass cylinder, which was then immediately  cooled by the jet of cold water used to condense the steam
If the cylinder  could somehow be kept hot through a full cycle, the fuel required to heat it  back up after each condensation would be saved
But how could this be done
To produce a working stroke, Watt needed to produce a partial vacuum in the  cylinder, and the only way he could see to do this was to cool the cylinder  enough to condense the steam within it
Yet to start the next cycle, he had to  fi ll the cylinder again with steam, which quickly used up much of its heat  simply bringing the cold brass walls back up to the boiling point
There seemed  to be no way to avoid the wasteful cycle of heating and cooling
Then one day in May 1765, as Watt was walking across the Glasgow Green, he hit on the solution: simply condense the steam somewhere else
Instead of  injecting cold water directly into the hot cylinder, why not let the steam pass  into an adjoining chamber that was kept immersed in a bath of cold water
As  the fi rst fl ow of steam entered this chamber and began to condense, the result- ing partial vacuum would suck the rest of the steam out of the cylinder and  be  gin the power stroke
A small pump would then remove the resulting water  and any residual air from the condenser chamber, and the cycle could be re - peated
Watt could thus keep the cylinder hot and the condenser cold, saving  an enormous amount of fuel
Once he had hit on the idea for the separate condenser, Watt faced the long  work of development and refi nement needed to put it into practical form
For  tifi ed with a loan from Black (as valuable in its own way as any earlier ad - vice about latent heat), Watt experimented with various confi gurations and  in 1769 secured a patent “for a method of lessening the consumption of steam  and fuel in fi re-engines
” A few years later he moved to Birmingham in the  English Midlands and formed a partnership with Matthew Boulton, an am - bitious local maker of metal goods
There they built a substantial engine- making works and began designing and building hundreds of engines for buy- ers throughout (1)(2) As Boulton famously told a visitor, “I sell here, sir,  what all the world desires to have,—power
”³ Boulton and Watt found a ready market among those seeking more effi - cient pumping engines
In 1778 Smeaton tested one of the new Watt engines  and found that, for each bushel of coal burned, it could raise nearly 19 million  pounds of water a distance of one foot—nearly four times the duty of an ordi- nary Newcomen engine and twice that achieved even by Smeatons own im - proved version
With improved workmanship, particularly in the accurate  boring of cylinders, Watt soon raised the duty of his engines to over 25 million
By charging a royalty amounting to one-third the cost of the fuel saved by  switching to their more efficient engine, Boulton and Watt were able to save  their customers money while turning an excellent profi t for themselves
Boulton saw that the market for pumping engines was inherently lim- ited—as he observed, “there is no other Cornwall to be found”—and he began  to push Watt to design engines that could be used to drive textile mills and  other factories
⁴ Such applications required steady rotative motion of the kind  that had long been supplied by water wheels
In fact, some desperate mill own- 3

ers, beset by low water or diverted streams, had already begun to use Savery  and Newcomen engines to pump water back up to turn their wheels
The ob - vious inefficiencies of this “water-returning” technique led various millwrights  to try to couple their old engines directly to mill machinery, but the jerky  stroke of the Newcomen engine made this difficult
In the early 1780s Watt  introduced improved valves and linkages that smoothed out the stroke of his  engines and enabled them to deliver steady rotative motion
This soon set off a boom in the use of steam engines to power mill machinery
Nearly two-thirds  of the steam engines built in the eighteenth century went up in the 1780s and  1790s, and more than half of these new engines were used to drive textile mills  or other factories
Watt ran his boilers at pressures only a little above that of the atmosphere,  so that in his engines, as in Newcomens, the work was done not by the expan- sive force of the steam but by atmospheric pressure pushing on the piston after  the steam had been condensed
Watt knew that steam at higher pressures could  be used to drive the piston directly, but his deep fear of boiler explosions kept  him from pursuing this course
Others were not always so cautious, and by  the 1790s engineers around Britain were beginning to experiment with high- Watt Steam Engine  with a Separate Condenser In the 1760s, James Watt hit on a way to  improve the Newcomen engine by adding  a separate condenser
Instead of being  forced to cool the entire cylinder in order  to condense the steam within it, one could  now condense the steam in a separate  chamber (C) that was kept constantly cool  by a bath of cold water
Watt made many  other improvements to the steam engine,  including adding a steam jacket to keep  the cylinder constantly hot and a small  pump (A) to remove water and residual air  from the chamber
pressure steam
Richard Trevithick, a Cornish builder of pumps and engines,  began producing steam at several times atmospheric pressure and using it to  drive a piston directly
He dispensed with the separate condenser and simply  vented the spent steam into the air, leading to his engines being called “puffers
” Such engines were compact and powerful, and between 1801 and 1804 Trevithick  used them to drive his fi rst experimental steam carriages and locomotives
Even without condensers, the little puffer engines were surprisingly efficient, often achieving duties greater than those of much larger Watt engines
Unfor- tunately, working at such high pressures posed real dangers, and when the  boiler of one of Trevithicks engines exploded near London in 1803, killing  four, Boulton and Watt spread the word that using high-pressure steam was  not worth the risk
Safety fears kept high-pressure engines from coming into  wide use in Britain until years later, and when they were eventually adopted to  power steamboats and railway locomotives, the death toll from bursting boil- ers turned out to be almost as high as Watt had warned
Trevithick knew his high-pressure engines were efficient, but he was not  sure why
One of the keys was expansive working, a principle Watt himself had  hit upon some years earlier
If we let high-pressure steam into a cylinder and  then cut off the fl ow before the piston has completed its upward stroke, the  steam will continue for a time to expand on its own, pushing against the piston  with gradually diminishing force until the pressure within the cylinder drops  to that of the atmosphere
An engine worked expansively puts out a little less  power than one in which steam is admitted throughout the full stroke, but it  uses far less fuel, since more of the expansive force in the steam is put to work  before it is sucked into the condenser or vented into the air
The advantages of  expansive working come into play, however, only when the pressure of the  steam entering the cylinder is substantially greater than that of the atmos- phere, and Watt did not pursue the idea in his own low-pressure engines
Trevithick practiced expansive working in some of his high-pressure engines,  though initially more by accident than design
Other engineers, particularly  Arthur Woolf, made more deliberate use of the principle in two-stage engines  that used the exhaust steam from a small high-pressure cylinder to supply a  larger low-pressure cylinder fi tted with a condenser
Such compound engines  could wring even more work from a given quantity of steam, but they were  expensive to build and tricky to operate
In England, where coal was abun- dant, it was usually cheaper to build a simple single-stage engine and pay for  the extra fuel it burned than to invest in a more efficient compound engine
British engineers found a better market for their fuel-efficient designs in coun- tries where coal was more expensive, and after 1815 compound engines came  into wide use in (1)(2)
Smeaton, Watt, and a number of other early steam engine makers bor- rowed methods and techniques from science, particularly to analyze the work- ings of their engines and test their performance
Smeatons measurements of  duty provide a clear example of such scientifi c engineering, as do his systematic  efforts to improve the design and operation of the Newcomen engine
Watt,  too, made careful measurements, fi tting his cylinders with pressure gauges that  enabled him to check that the condensation was complete and the valve set- tings were optimal
In the 1790s, he and his assistants devised an “indicator  diagram” that tracked how the internal pressure changed as the piston moved  along the cylinder
By simultaneously marking on a single sheet both the pres- sure on the piston and the distance through which it acted, the indicator dia- gram gave a graphic depiction of the output of the engine: the area enclosed  by the curve measured the work delivered by each stroke
By carefully study- ing such diagrams, an experienced engineer could see how to adjust an engine  for maximum efficiency, or even how to improve its design
Not surprisingly,  Boulton and Watt considered the indicator diagram one of their most valuable  trade secrets, and it did not become public knowledge until the 1820s
While engineers such as Smeaton and Watt drew on scientifi c methods and  techniques, they made little use of scientifi c knowledge about the relationship  between heat and work, for little such knowledge yet existed
The mechanics  of force and work were well understood in the eighteenth century, and phe- nomena of heat and temperature were becoming the focus of close scientifi c  study by both chemists and physicists, particularly toward the end of the cen- tury
Within the main Newtonian tradition, however, heat was thought to have  little to do with work
Although the physical sciences made rapid advances in  the decades around 1800, they did so mainly along lines unrelated to the power  revolution that was gathering steam in those same years
Laplacian Physics Isaac Newton (1642–1727) once said that if he had seen further than others, it  was because he stood on the shoulders of giants
In the eighteenth century no  giant loomed larger than Newton himself, and for more than a century after  the publication of his Principia (1687), scientists and natural philosophers  viewed the physical world largely in the light cast by his achievements
Build- ing on the work of Nicholas Copernicus and Johannes Kepler on the structure  of the planetary system and of Galileo Galilei on the motion of bodies, New- ton had formulated a set of mathematical laws of force and motion that could  account for everything from the orbit of a planet to the fall of an apple
His  law of universal gravitation, which states that every particle in the universe  attracts every other with a force proportional to the product of their masses  and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, came  to be seen as the model of what a good scientifi c theory ought to be
Many  natural philosophers in the eighteenth century hoped they would eventually  be able to explain the phenomena of heat, light, electricity, and magnetism in  the same way, as consequences of mathematically defi nable forces acting across  the short distances between microscopic particles
Most engineers of the day  followed a different course, for while they found Newtons laws of motion use- ful for analyzing the workings of their machinery, they saw little practical  ad vantage in attempting to reduce macroscopic phenomena to the action of  molecular forces
Among the strongest and most ambitious proponents of the Newtonian or  “astronomical” approach to physics were the French mathematician Pierre- Simon Laplace (1749–1827) and his circle of followers, known as the Lapla- cians
Laplace had shown great mathematical talent at an early age and rose  rapidly in the scientifi c establishment of prerevolutionary France, winning  election to the Royal Academy of Sciences when he was just 24
He refi ned and  extended Newtons work on the motions of the planetary system, developing  powerful new mathematical techniques that he eventually codifi ed in his mon- umental Mécanique céleste (Celestial Mechanics), published in fi ve volumes be - tween 1799 and 1825
Laplace came to be known as “the Newton of his age,” a  title that appealed to his considerable vanity
The mathematician (1) (1) Lagrange (1736–1813) supposedly once said that  Newton was the happiest man who could ever live, for there was only one  system of the world and he had found it
If true, that left Laplace in an awk- ward position: he might be the Newton of his age, but Newton had apparently  left him with no more worlds to conquer
Perhaps in response, Laplace turned  to what was in effect a new world: that of the minute particles that he and  many other scientists of his day believed were responsible for the phenomena  of heat, light, electricity, and magnetism
Newton had sometimes speculated  about such things; now Laplace would bring Newtons own methods and stan- dards to bear on this microworld, measuring and calculating the forces act- ing between tiny molecular particles just as Newton had found those acting  be  tween the sun and planets
Laplaces friend Claude Louis Berthollet (1748– 1822) sought to do the same for chemistry, explaining the whole range of chem- ical properties and reactions by attractive and repulsive forces between particles  of matter
Laplace began his move from celestial mechanics to terrestrial physics in  the early 1780s when the chemist Antoine Lavoisier (1743–94) asked him to  help with some experiments on heat
Together they developed the ice calo- rimeter, a device that used the melting of measured amounts of ice to gauge  the heat released in various reactions
Lavoisier and Laplace looked on heat as  a fl uid made up of tiny weightless particles of “caloric
” By using their calo- rimeter to measure how heat passed between different states and substances,  they hoped to be able to fi nd quantitative laws governing how particles of ca - loric acted on one another and on ordinary matter
Laplace was also intrigued by work the French engineer Charles Coulomb  (1736–1806) published in 1785 on electrical forces
It had long been known that  electrically charged bits of chaff or paper attract or repel one another, but  Coulomb was the fi rst to measure these minuscule forces quantitatively, using  a sensitive torsion balance he had devised
He found that electrostatic forces  followed an inverse square law, just like Newtons law of gravitation: double  the distance between two charged particles and the force between them falls  by a factor of four
This discovery opened a wide new fi eld to which Laplace  and his followers could transfer the powerful mathematical tools he had de - veloped for celestial mechanics, enabling them to solve electrical problems  with great precision and rigor
Laplace wanted to do the same thing across the board, and by the 1790s he had formulated a comprehensive explanatory program
As he declared in  his 1796 System of the World, by discovering the laws of molecular force, “we  shall be able to raise the physics of terrestrial bodies to the state of perfection  to which celestial physics has been brought by the discovery of universal gra- vi tation
”⁵ Laplace sought to explain all physical and chemical phenomena,  and ultimately the workings of the entire universe, by attractive and repulsive  forces acting between invisibly small particles
Moreover, he would base his  claims not on loose speculation and guesswork but on rigorous mathematical  theory coupled to precise experimental measurement
In its sweep and ambi- tion, the Laplacian program was truly (1)(2)
Laplacian science was Napoleonic in a more direct sense as well: it relied  on the patronage of Napoleon Bonaparte himself
Napoleon had been trained 5

as an artillery officer and was proud of his scientifi c and mathematical abilities
As a rising young general in 1797, he had won election to the scientifi c section  of the Institute of France, the successor to the old Royal Academy of Sciences  and the pinnacle of the French scientifi c world
His chief sponsors had been  Laplace and (1)(2) Both before and after he seized control of the French  state in 1799, Napoleon liked to surround himself with scientists, both to draw  on their expertise and to use their intellectual prestige to bolster his own claims  to legitimacy as the proper heir to the ideals of the (1)(2) He brought  Berthollet and many other scientists along on his 1798 expedition to Egypt and  later appointed several to high posts in his government, including Laplace,  who served briefl y as minister of the interior before it became clear he was  temperamentally unsuited to such an administrative position
Napoleon sub- sequently named both Laplace and Berthollet to the French Senate, positions  that brought them great prestige and substantial incomes
The depth of Napo- leons real commitment to reason and science is questionable; his main con- cern was to strengthen his own grip on power, and he was quite willing to pull  back from the ideals of the Enlightenment when it suited his political pur- poses
Whatever his true motives, however, Napoleons rule provided fertile  ground for French science and particularly for the ambitious efforts of Laplace  and (1)(2)
In 1801, Berthollet bought a large country house at Arcueil, just outside  Paris; in 1806 Laplace moved in next door
Berthollet built an excellent lab o- ratory there, and in 1807 he and Laplace launched the Society of Arcueil, a  pri vate scientifi c club that met at Berthollets house
Although it never had  more than about 15 members and lasted only until 1814, this little society did  much to shape the course of French physics and chemistry
Laplace and  Berthollet would invite bright young students to its meetings, befriend them,  draw them into working on the Laplacian program, and then pull strings to  advance their scientifi c careers
The Ecole Polytechnique provided their chief  recruiting ground
An elite school founded by the revolutionary government  in 1794, it offered a hand-picked group of a few hundred “cadets” intensive  instruction in science and mathematics intended to prepare them for later  specialized engineering training and eventual military or government service
Both Laplace and Berthollet taught at the Ecole Polytechnique at various  times, and almost all of the younger Laplacians, including Jean-Baptiste Biot,  Siméon-Denis Poisson, Joseph Gay-Lussac, and François Arago, had been stu- dents there
From their base at Arcueil, Laplace and Berthollet used their combination  of scientifi c eminence and political power to run much of the business of the scientifi c section of the institute, and thus much of the French scientifi c world
They made active use of the system of prize competitions, in which the in - stitute would set a research topic, solicit anonymous entries, and then choose  a winner, who received a cash award and a big boost to his or her career
By  se  lecting an appropriate topic, recruiting entrants, and then helping judge the  results, Laplace and Berthollet were able to steer research in directions they  desired while also cementing the loyalty of their Laplacian recruits
This strat- egy worked especially well in the competition announced in 1808, when en - trants were asked to explain double refraction, the puzzling ability of certain  crystals to split a beam of light into two beams with oddly different properties
Etienne Malus won the prize in 1810 with a brilliant paper that bolstered the  Laplacians favored particle theory of light by showing how short-range molec- ular forces could produce the splitting
In the course of his experiments, Malus  also discovered that light refl ected off glass at a glancing angle becomes “polar- ized,” so that it can pass through a double-refracting crystal or other fi lter only  if the crystal or the fi lter is oriented in a particular way
It was as if the beam  of light had acquired left and right “sides
” Maluss discovery opened a new  realm of optical research, and his death in 1812 deprived the Laplacian group  of one of its rising stars
The Laplacians scored successes in other prize competitions, notably one  in 1811 on the specifi c heats of gases, but they ran into increasing troubles after  the initial fall of Napoleon in 1814 and his fi nal defeat at Waterloo in 1815 de - prived them of their most powerful political backing
When the French mon- archy was restored, Laplace quickly swore allegiance to the new king and in  1817 was rewarded by being made a marquis, but his willingness to turn with  the political winds led many to deride him as “the weathercock
” The Arcueil  circle was by then clearly in decline
Laplace and Berthollet were in their late  60s, and though Biot and Poisson remained loyal, several of the younger mem- bers, especially Arago, chafed at being mere followers
The Laplacians grip on  prize competitions began to slip
One on the vibrations of elastic surfaces,  set in 1809 with the expectation it would be solved in Laplacian fashion, re - mained open until 1816, when Sophie Germain (1776–1831), who as a woman  had been excluded from the Arcueil circle, won it with a brilliant mathemati- cal analysis that ignored the Laplacians model of particles and forces
The  Laplacians faced another setback two years later when they used a prize com- petition to try to head off a feared resurgence of the wave theory of light
The  outcome of the latter episode reveals much about both the strengths and weak- nesses of the Laplacian program
The chief French proponent of the wave theory of light was a young grad- uate of the Ecole Polytechnique, Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1788–1827)
He had  not been drawn into the Laplacian circle and had instead begun work as a  government engineer, building roads and bridges in the provinces
In his spare  time he took up optics, performing delicate experiments and becoming con- vinced that light consists not of streams of bullet-like particles but of waves in  a jelly-like “ether” that fi lls all space
Thomas Young (1773–1829) had been de - veloping similar ideas in England, but he attracted little support, and Fresnel  seems initially to have been unaware of his work
Amid the political turmoil  of 1815, Fresnel returned to Paris and soon attracted the attention of Arago, by  then a sort of renegade (1)(2) Together they launched an anti-Laplacian  insurgency that was partly a political struggle for control of French scientifi c  institutions and partly an intellectual struggle over the true nature of light:  particles or waves
The main evidence in favor of the wave theory was the appearance of dark,  light, and colored bands around the edges of otherwise crisp shadows
Accord- ing to wave theorists, these diffraction bands, and the even more striking pat- terns of parallel lines produced when light was allowed to pass through two  closely spaced slits, could result only from the interference of waves of light, as  the crests and troughs of waves coming from different points either reinforced  each other or canceled each other out
The Laplacians wanted to blunt this  argument by fi nding an alternative explanation based on molecular forces act- ing on streaming particles of light, and in hopes of eliciting such a theory they  set diffraction as the topic of the 1818 prize competition, now under the aus- pices of the resurrected Royal Academy of (1)(2) Arago was named to the  committee of judges, but the rest of its members were Laplacian loyalists: Biot,  Poisson, Gay-Lussac, and Laplace himself
Fresnel submitted a very strong entry  in which he showed not only how to measure the wavelengths of the different  colors of light, but also how to calculate the positions and even the intensities  of the diffraction bands they produced
With its close fi t between precise ex - perimental measurements and elaborate mathematical theory, Fresnels entry  met all of the Laplacians criteria except one: it was not based on particles and  forces
Would the committee nonetheless award Fresnel the prize
In 1819 it  did just that, with Laplace himself apparently casting the deciding vote
In the  end, the Laplacians standards of mathematical theory and quantitative exper- iment were evidently more important to them (or at least to Laplace himself )  than was their model of particles and forces
By the mid-1820s the Laplacian group was rapidly passing from the scene,  but it had already left a permanent mark on how science is done
By uniting precise quanti tative experi ment with mathematical theory, the Laplacians had  helped bring Newtonian physics down to earth
They had important successes,  but their grand ambitions soon led them to push physics into areas in which  their own model of particles and forces did not work well, and it was eventu- ally forced to give way to approaches that recognized other mechanisms and  modes of action
The new experimental and mathematical physics the Lapla- cians had forged lived on, however, and the high standards they had set soon  came to pervade the physical sciences
By the 1820s, and more fully and defi n- itively in the decades that followed, physicists were ready to bring those rigor- ous standards to bear on a question of growing practical importance: the rela- tionship between heat and work
Sadi Carnot and the Birth of Thermodynamics In the summer of 1824, one of the most remarkable books in the history of  physics fi rst appeared in the bookstalls of (1)(2) A slim volume of just over 100 pages, Refl exions on the Motive Power of Fire, and on Machines Fitted to Develop  That Power offered a pathbreaking analysis of the steam engine and a clear  statement of the general principles governing how the fl ow of heat can be har- nessed to produce work
Its author, a young army engineer named Sadi Carnot  (1796–1832), is now acclaimed as the founder of the science of thermodynam- ics
At the time, however, his ideas raised hardly a ripple in the scientifi c  world
Sadi Carnot was the son of Lazare Carnot (1753–1823), himself an eminent  army engineer and mathematician
The elder Carnot was also a leading fi gure  in the French Revolution, known as “the Organizer of Victory” for his role in  raising and directing the armies that defended revolutionary France in the  1790s
Napoleon later appointed him minister of war, but Carnot soon resigned  to pursue his scientifi c interests
His writings helped found the French tradi- tion of engineering mechanics, in which general scientifi c and mathematical  principles are used to analyze the workings of machines
In his most important  result, Lazare Carnot showed that any percussion in a series of gears or turbu- lence in a hydraulic system reduces the efficiency with which the machine or  system can transmit power
This “principle of continuity” foreshadowed later  ideas about the conservation of energy
After graduating from the Ecole Polytechnique in 1814, Sadi Carnot fol- lowed his father into the army engineering corps
With the restoration of the  monarchy in 1815, however, Lazare Carnot was forced into political exile and  his sons military career languished
In 1820 Sadi Carnot took a leave of absence, essentially entering the army reserves, and devoted himself to private study in  Paris of scientifi c, engineering, and economic questions
Although he shared  the Laplacians commitment to quantitative experiment and their belief in the  caloric theory of heat, Carnot was not invited to join their fading circle at Ar - cueil, nor did he pursue their goal of explaining phenomena by forces acting  between microscopic particles
Although he sometimes speculated about such  molecular interactions, he preferred, like most engineers, to focus on macro- scopic quantities he could measure and manipulate, such as pressure, volume,  and temperature
Carnots interest in engineering and economic development soon drew  him to the steam engine
Like many others, he was convinced that the pre- eminence Britain enjoyed in the 1820s was based on the power of steam
“To  take away today from England her steam-engines,” he declared, “would be to  dry up all her sources of wealth, to ruin all on which her prosperity depends,  in short, to annihilate that colossal power
”⁶ Hoping to achieve wealth and  power of their own, French industrialists erected hundreds of steam engines in  the decade after 1815, many of them compound engines built by enterprising  British engineers
The high duty such engines could achieve when run at high  pressures was a great selling point in France, where coal was expensive, and  enthusiasts began to suggest that by running at even higher pressures, and  perhaps using air or alcohol as the working substance in place of steam, there  might be no limit to how much work could be extracted from a bushel of coal
This was just the sort of question that appealed to Carnot, both as a keen  student of industrial economics and as heir to his fathers work on the efficiency of machines and to the broader French tradition of scientifi c engineering
Self- taught British engineers might excel at actually making steam engines, but it  was a French engineer, trained at the Ecole Polytechnique, who took up the  task of working out their underlying principles
Carnot began by noting a crucial point that Watts invention of the sepa- rate condenser had helped bring to the fore: steam engines work by exploiting  the fl ow of heat from a hot place to a colder one, that is, from the boiler to the  condenser
A source of heat alone is not enough; without a reservoir of cooling  water, the steam could not be condensed and the engine would not work
Even  the high-pressure puffer engines that vented their steam into the open air were  in fact using the atmosphere itself as a giant low-temperature reservoir and  exploiting the fl ow of heat into it
Enclose the whole system in an insulated 6

box, so that heat could not continually fl ow away from it, and any steam en - gine would soon stop running
A steam engine, Carnot said, works much like a water wheel
Just as a water  wheel produces useful work by harnessing the fl ow of water from a higher ele- vation to a lower one, so a steam engine harnesses the fl ow of heat or “ca  loric”  from a higher tem perature to a lower one
Caloric was not used up in the  process, Carnot said, any more than water is used up when it passes through a  water wheel
He regarded caloric as a real substance and argued that it simply  passed from a more concentrated state in the boiler to a more diffuse one in  the condenser water; all of the caloric was still there, he said, just as all of the  water was still there in the lower pool after it passed through a water wheel
Carnot drew an important lesson from this analysis: for maximum effi - ciency, every fl ow of heat, every “fall” of caloric from a high temperature to a  lower one, should be put to work, just as every inch of the fall of water in a  well-designed water wheel is harnessed to turn the wheel
Any heat that is  allowed to pass from the boiler of a steam engine to its cooling reservoir with- out working the piston along the way is wasted just as surely as is water that  spills over the top of a dam
A hot object should never be allowed to touch a  cold one, Carnot said, for the heat that inevitably fl ows between them by  conduc tion could, with proper design, have been harnessed to do useful work
Indeed, in the world around us heat is continually passing from hotter objects  to cooler ones, tending eventually to reduce everything to a state of lukewarm  uniformity
The task of the engineer, as Carnot saw it, is to fi nd the best way  to capture that fl ow and turn it to human use
In an argument of striking originality, Carnot showed that there is an ab - solute limit to the amount of work any heat engine can produce from the fall  of a given quantity of heat
Imagine, he said, the simplest possible heat engine:  two bodies, one hot and one cold, and a box of air fi tted with a piston
Start  by putting the box in contact with the hot body; as the air absorbs heat, it will  expand and push the piston upward, doing work
If we now insulate the box,  the air within it will continue to expand for a time, doing further work as it  gradually cools; this corresponds to the expansive working of a steam engine
When the temperature of the box of air has fallen to that of the cold body,  Carnot said, put the two in contact and slowly compress the air at a constant  temperature until all of the heat it had earlier absorbed from the hot body has  passed into the cold one
Most analysts would have stopped at this point, for  Carnot had laid out a uniquely efficient way to generate work by the transfer  of heat without ever letting two bodies at appreciably different temperatures  come into contact
Carnot went on, however, to add a crucial fi nal step: remove Clapeyrons Form of the Carnot Cycle In 1824, Sadi Carnot  worked out the most  efficient possible cycle of  operations for any heat  engine; in 1834, Emile  Clapeyron cast it into the  graphical form shown  here, which closely resem- bles one of James Watts  indicator diagrams
The Carnot cycle has  four stages: (1) Isothermal  expansion (from a to b on  the graph): We begin by  placing a cylinder fi lled  with air in contact with a hot body, A (at  temperature �1)
As heat fl ows from A into the cylinder, the air within the cylinder  expands and does work by pushing the   piston outward
(2) Adiabatic expansion (from b to c): We next put the cylinder in  contact with an insulating body, B, thus  blocking any further fl ow of heat
The air  in the cylinder continues to expand on its  own, pushing the piston further outward  and doing additional work as the air cools,  its temperature dropping from �1 to �2
(3) Isothermal compression (from c to d ): We now put the cylinder in contact with a  cooler body, C (at �2), and push the piston  inward
As we do work by compressing the  air in the cylinder, heat fl ows from the cyl- inder into (1) (4) Adiabatic compression (from d back to a): Finally, we put the cyl- inder back in contact with the insulating  body, B, and push the piston further  inward
As we do additional work by com- pressing the air in the cylinder, its temper- ature rises back up to �1
Because the  expansions take place at higher tempera- tures and pressures than the compressions,  the air does more work as it pushes the pis- ton outward during stages (1) and (2) than  we must do to restore the system to its  original state by pushing the piston back  inward during stages (3) and (4)
The Carnot cycle is fully reversible and  has two net effects: a quantity of heat fl ows  via the cylinder from the hot body, A, to the cooler one, C ; and the engine performs  an amount of work proportional to the  area enclosed by the curve abcd
The closer  we can come to producing a curve of that  shape, the more efficient our engine will  be
the box from contact with the cold body, he said, and continue to compress  the air until its temperature rises back to that of the hot body
This will return  the system to its original state so that the whole process can be repeated
The key to what became known as the “Carnot cycle” was its reversibility:  since heat was allowed to fl ow only between bodies that were at virtually the  same temperature, the whole sequence could be run backwards
By compress- ing the air at the higher temperature and forcing it to expand at the lower one,  we could, by doing work, pump heat from the cold body to the hotter one,  just as we can pump water uphill by running a water wheel backwards
As  Carnot pointed out, this meant that no engine, however complex and what- ever its working substance, could ever produce more work from a given fall  of heat than would a simple box of air run in his reversible cycle
If such a  super-efficient engine existed, we could simply hook it to one running the  Carnot cycle in reverse and use the latter to pump all of the heat back up to  the higher temperature to be run through again, like a pair of water wheels that  were somehow rigged to feed each other while still producing useful work
We  would be getting something for nothing, and on the grounds that such a per- petual motion machine is impossible, Carnot concluded that no heat engine  could be more efficient than his ideal reversible one
Carnot went on to show that the limit on the amount of work an engine  can generate is set by the high and low temperatures between which it oper- ates: the further the caloric falls, the more work it can do
That is why engines  that were run at high temperatures and pressures, such as Trevithicks puffers, were able to achieve such high duties
Even the best high-pressure compound  engines fell far short of the theoretical maximum, however; using measure- ments of the expansion of steam, Carnot showed that in practice such engines  harnessed no more than about 5 percent of the motive power that burning a  bushel of coal could in principle produce
Although Carnot had shown there  was an upper limit on the efficiency of any heat engine, there was still great  room for improvement, and his little book gave pointers on how this might be  achieved
It would be nearly 30 years before Carnots advice was taken
When his Re -  fl exions appeared in 1824 it attracted a few favorable notices, but no one took  up its ideas in a serious way
Both physicists and engineers of the day seem to  have found Carnots approach too foreign to their own ways of thinking
After  Carnot died of cholera in 1832, most of his papers were burned; his book had  already been largely forgotten
His ideas might have been lost sight of alto- gether had not another French engineer, Emile Clapeyron (1799–1864), pub- lished a paper in 1834 in which he cast Carnots mainly verbal arguments into mathematical and graphical form
Clapeyron had worked for a time in Russia  and may have seen indicator diagrams being used by Boulton and Watt engi- neers erecting steam engines there
By plotting Carnots sequence of expan- sions and compressions on the axes of an indicator diagram, showing how the  volume changed along with the temperature and pressure, he was able to make  the meaning of the Carnot cycle much clearer; for instance, the work produced  in each cycle appeared simply as the area enclosed by the resulting curve
He  also made more explicit the assumption that caloric is conserved during its  fl ow from a higher temperature to a lower one
Although Clapeyrons paper  did not stir up much interest when it was fi rst published, it was translated into  English in 1837 and German in 1843
These publications helped keep Carnots  ideas alive until a new generation of physicists began to take them up and  extend them in the later 1840s
Carnots efforts had been inspired by the rapidly advancing development  of the steam engine and by his desire to fi nd the principles behind what engi- neers had so far accomplished largely through trial and error
His analysis gave  deep insights into how the fl ow of heat can best be harnessed to produce useful  work and into the limits on this process; had engineers made full use of his  teachings, they could have substantially improved the efficiency of their en - gines
Carnot had based his arguments on the caloric theory, which held that  heat is a physical substance that can neither be created nor destroyed
We know  from his few surviving manuscript notes that after publishing his book he  became convinced that caloric does not exist and that heat is simply a mode of  motion, the bouncing around of ordinary molecules
Perhaps that is why Car- not did not publish any further analyses of heat and work after his 1824 Refl ex- ions: he may have realized that dropping the caloric theory would force him to  recast much of his earlier argument, and it was not easy to see how this might  be done
Certainly, questions about the status of caloric complicated the re - ception of Carnots theory of heat engines, for by the time other scientists  began to take it up in the late 1840s, they, like him, had begun to think not in  terms of caloric but of a broad new concept: energy
Nowadays, people blithely talk about energy as if they know exactly what it is
Companies buy and sell it, public officials make policy about it, and con- sumers try (we hope) to use it wisely
For all its ubiquity, however, “energy” is  a slippery concept and more recent in origin than one might expect
The idea  that all of the forces and powers of nature are manifestations of a single perva- sive but impalpable quantity emerged in its modern form only in the 1840s; by  1860, it had come to be widely accepted as a fundamental scientifi c truth
Yet  the inner nature of energy has remained elusive; as we shall see, its usual defi ni- tion, “capacity to do work,” breaks down in some important cases
The main  law governing its transformations is, however, simple enough: although energy  can change from one form into another—say, from chemical to thermal to  mechanical to electrical to radiant, as it does when energy from a coal-fi red  power plant passes along the wires to light up your home—it can neither be  created nor destroyed
Whatever else happens, the total amount of energy in  any closed system remains the same
The law of the conservation of energy,  also known as the fi rst law of thermodynamics, is perhaps the most sweeping  generalization in all of science, uniting everything in the universe, from atoms  to humans to stars, under a single overarching principle
Its companion, the second law of thermodynamics, is more subtle but no  less consequential
It too was fi rst formulated around 1850, although its key  term, entropy, has never entered popular language in quite the way energy has
The second law was foreshadowed by Sadi Carnots observation that as heat  fl ows from hot to cold, it tends toward a lukewarm equilibrium from which  no further useful work can be derived
The total amount of energy in the  world may never change, but as time goes on, less and less of it is available for  our use
According to the second law, the universe is slowly but inevitably run- ning down
With its grim forecast of inescapable “heat death,” the second law  sounded a pessimistic counterpoint to the faith in progress that otherwise  marked the nineteenth century
The laws of energy and entropy had many roots
Some lay within physics itself, or in neighboring sciences such as chemistry and physiology; others  could be found in religious or philosophical beliefs
The new science of ther- modynamics grew most directly, however, from the study of power technolo- gies, particularly steam engines, hot air engines, electrical motors, and other  means for converting one form of energy into another
As such devices prolif- erated in the fi rst decades of the nineteenth century, the science of energy be - gan to take shape
Converting Forces In her widely read 1834 book On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences, the  English mathematician and popular writer Mary Somerville (1780–1872) ob - served that “the progress of modern science, especially within the last fi ve years,  has been remarkable for a tendency to simplify the laws of nature, and to unite  detached branches by general principles
”¹ Close connections had re  cently been  discovered between electricity and magnetism, and there were growing indica- tions that heat and light were, in some of their forms, almost identical
More  and more ways were being found to convert one kind of force into another,  and by the 1840s several scientists and natural philosophers were beginning to  suggest that behind the multiplicity of physical phenomena lay a single unify- ing reality: energy
The formulation of the law of the conservation of energy is a classic case  of multiple independent discovery in the history of science
It is not hard to  come up with a list of 10 or 15 people who, between the late 1830s and early  1850s, put forward ideas that could later be seen as having foreshadowed one  or another aspect of the law of the con servation of energy
Theories about the  interconvert ibility of forces, the indestructibility of “motive power,” and the  equivalence of heat and mechanical work all contributed to the formulation of  what became the fi rst law of thermodynamics
The idea of the conservation of  energy was not quite “in the air” in the 1840s, but its ingredients certainly lay  close to the surface
A series of electrical discoveries in the fi rst decades of the nineteenth cen- tury played an important part in the evolution of ideas about the conversion  of forces and the conservation of energy
We will examine these discoveries  more closely in Chapter 4 but for now will focus briefl y on how they contrib- uted to the emergence of the concept of energy
In 1800 the Italian physicist 1
Mary Somerville, On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences (London: John Murray, 1834), preface
Alessandro Volta (1745–1827) found that by stacking discs of copper and zinc  on bits of pasteboard dampened with a weak acid, he could produce a steady  electric current
The current from such a “pile,” or battery, could generate  sparks, heat a wire until it glowed, decompose water into its constituent hydro- gen and oxygen, and produce other striking effects
What ultimately drove the  current was not immediately clear, but by the 1820s most scientists believed it  to be a chemical reaction between the metals and the acid in the pasteboard
The battery and circuit thus showed that chemical affinity could produce elec- trical force, which could in turn produce heat and light or, by decomposing  water or another compound, regenerate the force of chemical affinity
In 1820 the Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851) found  that an electric current fl owing in a wire could defl ect a magnetized needle
This demonstrated that electric force could produce magnetic force, which  could in turn generate motion, and inventors soon devised simple motors that  used electric currents to turn wheels and do other mechanical work
In 1831 the English experimenter Michael Faraday (1791–1867) brought the relation- ship between electricity, magnetism, and motion full circle when he discovered  electromagnetic induction: when a magnet is moved or spun near a coil of wire,  an electric current appears in the wire
By turning a crank and doing mechan- ical work, Faraday could now generate an electric current, lead it down a wire,  and use it to drive a distant motor
The combination of electrical generator,  wire, and motor provided a way to take work done at one place and transmit  it for use at another—the basis for the huge electric power systems we rely on  today
Faraday was deeply religious and saw “force” as something only God  could create or destroy
Absent divine intervention, he said, the amount of  force in the world remains constant, and human efforts and natural processes  can do no more than move it from place to place or change it from one form  into another
Belief in the convertibility of forces was reinforced in the 1820s when phys- icists found they could generate an electric current by joining wires made of  two different metals into a loop and heating one junction while keeping the  other cool
Such “thermocouples” seemed to produce electrical force directly  from heat
They also provided a sensitive way to measure small changes in  temperature, and in the 1830s several physicists used thermocouples to show  that radiant heat could be refl ected, refracted, and polarized just like visible  light
(1)-(1) Fresnel (1788–1827) had shown more than a decade before that light  consists of waves rather than particles; now it appeared that radiant heat, too,  must consist of such waves
The heat of the sun thus comes to us not as streams of caloric, but as waves in the ether
Such waves must either be heat itself or be  able to generate heat when they strike matter
Either way, it was becoming  harder to believe that heat was a material substance
The caloric theory was in trouble by the mid-1830s, but it had survived a  strong attack more than 30 years before
Benjamin Thompson (1753–1814) was  a colorful soldier of fortune and sometime inventor from Massachusetts who  had fought on the British side in the American (1)(2) He later served as  an adviser to a variety of European rulers, and in Munich in the 1790s acquired  the title by which he became best known: Count (1)(2) In 1797 he did  experiments on heat while supervising the boring of brass cannon barrels for  the Bavarian army
That friction produces heat had long been known, but ca - loric theorists said this was simply because, as two objects are ground against  each other, caloric is squeezed out by pressure or released by abrasion
By using  horses to drive a drill with a dull bit, Rumford showed that continued friction  could generate enormous amounts of heat—far more, he argued, than could  plausibly have been squeezed out by the modest pressure of his drill or released  from the tiny chips of brass it threw off
This proved, he said, that caloric could  not be a real substance and that heat must instead be a form of motion
Adher- ents of the caloric theory brushed off these claims, declaring that the experi- ments proved only that ordinary matter contains more caloric than Rumford  had supposed and that pressure and abrasion can release it in abundance
In  focusing on the heat produced by friction, Rumford had put his fi nger on a  weak point in the caloric theory, but the evidence he presented was not as  airtight as he liked to claim
It was only decades later, after belief in the inter- convertibility of forces had won acceptance on other grounds, that Rumfords  experiments came to be seen as having decisively refuted the caloric theory
By the early 1840s the idea that forces are never really destroyed but simply  change from one form into another had many proponents, including Faraday  in England, the chemist Justus von Liebig in Germany, and the engineer Lud- vig Colding in (1)(2) Among its most infl uential advocates was the Brit- ish lawyer and amateur scientist William Robert Grove (1811–96)
Grove had  done extensive work on electrical batteries, which he came to see as essentially  devices for converting chemical force into other forms
In a series of lectures  in 1842–43 and a book, On the Correlation of Physical Forces (1846 and many  later editions), Grove cited many such conversion processes and argued that  they held the key to understanding the full range of physical phenomena
The  great remaining problem, he said, was to determine the “exchange rate” gov- erning the conversion of one kind of force into another
If this could be quan- tifi ed, we would be able to trace the passage of force from one form into an - other and back again, with none of it ultimately being lost
Grove did not know it, but a value for the most important such exchange  rate, that between mechanical work and heat, had already been published,  though not in a form calculated to inspire confi dence
Robert Mayer (1814–78) was a young German physician who in 1840 had set off as a ships doctor on a  year-long voyage to the East (1)(2) Off Java, several crewmen came down with  fever, and following the usual practice of the day, Mayer opened their veins  to  let blood
He was struck by its color, a much brighter red than he was used  to in Germany, and at fi rst worried he had hit an artery
On the long voyage  home he brooded over what he had seen and traced out its implications
He  accepted Lavoisiers theory that we generate body heat by oxidizing our food
Since in a hot climate we do not need to burn as much food to keep our- selves warm, we should expect venous blood to retain more of its oxygen in  the  tropics than it does in a cold climate; indeed, as Mayer had observed, it  might remain almost as brightly red as arterial blood
But if the oxidation of  food is the source of our internal body heat, Mayer asked, what about the heat  we can generate externally, by doing work and, like Rumfords horses, produc- ing friction
All of the heat we produce must, he said, be charged to the same  account; it must all derive ultimately from the oxida tion of our food, whether  the heat appears internally in our bodies or externally in objects on which we  perform work
From this, Mayer drew a sweeping conclusion: there must be a  universal equivalence between heat and work
Mayer became obsessed with the idea that work can be converted into heat  according to a fi xed ratio
On his return to Germany, he pestered his friends  about it and called on local physics professors to explain his theory
Most had  trouble taking him entirely seriously, especially when he told them he could  raise the temperature of a bottle of water simply by shaking it
Mayer felt sure  his idea of the indestructibility of “force” held the key to the deepest secrets of  the universe, ranging from the efficiency of steam engines to the immortality  of the soul
He tried to bolster his case with mathematical arguments, but his  grasp of the subject was weak; in a letter to a friend, he once ended up trying  to prove that 2 � 0
It is perhaps not surprising that when Mayer sent his fi rst  paper on force and heat to the leading German physics journal, the Annalen  der Physik, it was rejected
Was Mayer a crank
Perhaps, but if so, he was that rare thing, a crank who  was right
After his fi rst paper was turned down, Mayer tried to make his ideas  more palatable by emphasizing measurable facts
With remarkable insight, he found a way to use existing data on the compression and heating of gases to  derive a value for the conversion of work into heat—what later came to be  called the mechanical equivalent of heat
If we let a mass of one kilogram fall  from a height of 365 meters and then convert all of the resulting work into  heat, it would, Mayer said, be enough to raise the temperature of a kilogram  of water by 1°C (that is, to produce one kilocalorie of heat)
He sent a short  paper with this result to Liebigs Annalen der Chemie in 1842; it was promptly  published and later provided the foundation for Mayers claim to be counted  as the discoverer of the law of the conservation of energy
He had high hopes  that his paper would be recognized as a great contribution to science and was  bitterly disappointed when it attracted little notice
Mayer and his work would  probably have been completely forgotten had not others independently hit on  similar results a few years later
One of these was Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–94), a young German  scientist who followed a path in some ways quite similar to Mayers and in  others very different
Like Mayer, Helmholtz was trained as a physician and  had a deep interest in questions of bodily heat and work
He was, however, far  more adept at mathematics than Mayer and better equipped to relate his ideas  about force (in German, Kraft ) to existing scientifi c theories
According to a  well-known theorem in Newtonian mechanics, the total “living force,” or vis viva, of a system of bodies does not change when those bodies undergo elastic  collisions
The vis viva of a particle is defi ned as its mass times the square of its  velocity (mv2), and the theorem stated that while vis viva can pass from one  body to another in such collisions, the total for all of the bodies involved  remains constant
Helmholtz also argued that what he called “tensional force”  (Spannkraft) can be converted into vis viva and back again
In the most famil- iar case, the weight of a body multiplied by its height above the ground defi nes  its gravitational Spannkraft (in later terms, its potential energy); as the body  falls and acquires speed, this turns into vis viva
When it hits and bounces back  up, slowing as it rises, its vis viva turns back into (1)(2) This much was  already familiar, but in his 1847 essay “The Conservation of Force” (“Die Er - hal tung der Kraft”), Helmholtz showed that if the world consists solely of  particles acting on each other through forces of attraction and repulsion, as in  the Laplacian model, then the sum of all forces, both living and tensional,  must always be constant
Force, as Helmholtz defi ned it, was not only convert- ible but rigidly conserved
One problem remained, however: what about friction and inelastic colli- sions
If we drop a ball made of soft clay, it does not bounce back up but just  goes splat; the Spannkraft it had at the top turns into vis viva on the way down but then seems to be lost completely when the ball hits the ground and stops
Helmholtz replied that the vis viva of the ball is not really lost but is simply  redistributed as invisible motion of its molecules, which, he said, constitutes  heat
He found a mathematically precise way to express the previously vague  idea that forces can be converted from one form into another and proceeded  to use his conservation law to elucidate a wide range of physical phenomena
Although the older generation of German physicists regarded Helmholtzs es - say as overly speculative—like Mayers fi rst paper, it was rejected by the Annalen  der Physik, and Helmholtz instead had it published as a pamphlet—within a  few years younger scientists in both Germany and Britain came to regard it as  a founding statement of the principle of the conservation of energy
Helm- holtzs essay lacked one thing, however: solid empirical data on the conversion  of work into heat
Helmholtz was unaware of Mayers 1842 paper, and though  he cited more recent experiments by the young Englishman James Joule, he  seems not to have grasped the real magnitude of what Joule had achieved
James Joule and the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat James Prescott Joule (1818–89) did more than anyone else to establish the prin- ciple of the conservation of energy and to determine the mechanical equivalent  of heat
His family owned a large brewery near Manchester, England, and he  shared the direct and practical orientation for which the inhabitants of that  great industrial center were known
Joule helped run the brewery for many  years and drew on its resources, particularly for precise temperature control, in  many of his experiments
His chief interest, however, lay not in making beer  but in discovering scientifi c truths
Joule was one of the last great scientifi c  amateurs; he never held a professional or academic scientifi c position and pur- sued his researches chiefl y out of personal curiosity and commitment to the  advancement of knowledge
While still in his teens, Joule was caught up in the widespread “electrical  euphoria” of the 1830s
The invention of the fi rst electric motors had stoked  hopes that electricity might soon provide a clean and efficient source of power  that would supplant the steam engine and revolutionize the economy
Electro- magnetic theory, as then understood, even led some enthusiasts to suggest  there might be no limit to the “duty” an electric motor might achieve; by run- ning the motor at higher and higher speeds, they said, we could squeeze as  much work as we wished from even a small battery
Joule shared these hopes  and began building motors of his own in the late 1830s
“I can hardly doubt,”  he declared in 1839, “that electro-magnetism will ultimately be substituted for  steam to propel machinery,” and he cited theoretical grounds for believing that “the cost of working [an electric motor] may be reduced ad infi nitum
”² Elec- tricity seemed to offer a realistic prospect of getting something for nothing
Joule was too practical minded to rely solely on theory, however, and in  1840–41 he carefully tested the actual efficiency of his motors
His bright hopes  were soon dashed as it became clear that even the best electric motors could  achieve only a miserably low duty
The batteries powering Joules motors  burned through fi ve pounds of zinc to do as much work as a good steam en - gine could pro duce by burning a single pound of coal—and pound for pound,  zinc cost 70 times as much as coal
More efficient electric motors would no  doubt be made in the future, but Joule found it hard to believe they could ever  be improved by the factor of 350 needed to compete with steam engines
Bat- tery-powered motors had no real prospect of supplanting steam engines for  anything beyond a few special ized uses, and Joules dreams of cheap electric  power faded rapidly in the 1840s
Joule continued to study the performance of his electric motors, batteries,  and generators, focusing in particular on the heat that appeared in their coils  and connecting wires
By the end of 1840 he had established what later became  known as “Joules law”: an electric current generates heat at a rate proportional  to the square of its strength multiplied by the resistance of the conductor  (I 2 •R )
He then noticed that when the battery or generator drove a motor that  did mechanical work, less heat appeared in the wires—and the more work, the  less heat
Like many other scientists of the time, Joule became convinced that  heat was not a substance but simply invisible motions of the molecules that  make up ordinary matter
Moreover, he claimed, work and heat are intercon- vertible: not only can work be turned into heat, either by mechanical friction  or electrical resistance, but under some circumstances, such as in a steam en - gine, heat can be converted into work
This was his fi rst glimmer of the principle of the conservation of energy,  and to put it on a quantitative basis, he set out in 1843 to measure the ratio  between work and heat, or what he initially called “the mechanical value of  heat
” His fi rst method was indirect: using a hand crank or falling weights to  spin a magnet and coil between the jaws of a powerful electromagnet, he gen- erated electric currents whose heat he captured in a cylinder fi lled with water
His initial results were rough, but they indicated that letting a weight of about  800 pounds fall a distance of one foot would suffice to raise the temperature  of a pound of water by 1°F—in other words, 800 foot-pounds of work was 2

about equal to one British thermal unit, or “Btu,” of heat
(In metric terms,  the fall of about 440 kilograms through one meter would raise the temperature  of a kilogram of water by 1°C, or generate one kilocalorie of heat
) Convinced he was on the track of a fundamental result, Joule strove to  improve the accuracy and persuasiveness of his measurements
First, he elimi- nated the electrical middleman: instead of relying on a complicated apparatus  involving wires, magnets, and the mysterious intermediary of electricity, he  found ways to convert mechanical work directly into measurable heat
He com- pressed air using a pump immersed in water and showed that the total heat  generated again pointed toward a mechanical equivalent of about 800 foot- pounds per (1)(2) He forced water through small holes in a piston, measured the  heat generated by friction, and again found a value of 800 foot-pounds per  Btu, or perhaps a little less
Finally, in 1845, Joule embarked on his famous  series of paddle wheel experiments, in which he showed he could raise the tem- perature of water by a measurable amount simply by stirring it
The idea behind Joules paddle wheel experiments was simple: expend a  measured amount of work agitating a known quantity of water and, once the  water has stopped swirling around, measure any change in its temperature
Ac  tually doing it was difficult, however, for the expected rise in temperature  was very small and there were many possible sources of error—even the heat  radiating from the experimenters own body could throw off the measurement
Aided by a talented instrument maker, (1) (1) Dancer, Joule fi tted a small brass  vessel with a set of paddles driven by cords attached to falling weights
The  descent of the weights gave a direct measure of the work expended, and Dan - cers exquisitely sensitive thermometer—readable to within a hundredth of a  degree—showed the increase in temperature
Working in a large cellar at his  family brewery, aided by workmen to raise the weights, and drawing on brew- ers techniques for the careful regulation and measurement of temperature,  Joule arrived by summer 1847 at a consistent value for the mechanical equiva- lent of heat: 782 foot-pounds of work raised the temperature of a pound of  water by 1°(1) Using whale oil or mercury in place of water gave the same value  to within less than 1 percent
(Joule repeated the measurement under even more  exacting conditions in 1849 and arrived at a fi gure of 772 foot-pounds per Btu;  the currently accepted value is 778
) In retrospect, Joules work in the 1840s stands as one of the great achieve- ments of nineteenth-century physics
It was not seen that way at the time
His  fi rst paper on the mechanical equivalent of heat, presented at the 1843 meeting  of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, was ignored
The  Royal Society of London rejected his 1844 paper on the heating of air by com- pression
When he delivered a lecture entitled “Matter, Living Force, and  Heat” at a Manchester church reading room in April 1847, a local newspaper  published the text, but the broader scientifi c community paid no attention
Joule did what he could to bring out the wider signifi cance of his work
Like Faraday, he related the conservation of force to Gods role as creator, say- ing it was “manifestly absurd to suppose that the powers with which God has  endowed matter can be destroyed any more than that they can be created by  mans agency
”³ He also stressed the practical value his fi ndings could have for 3

Joules Paddle Wheel  Experiment Convinced by experiments with electric  motors that work could be converted into  heat, James Joule devised his paddle wheel  apparatus in 1845 as a way to demonstrate  and measure such conversion directly
He  attached a weight to a string in such a way  that the slow descent of the weight made a  set of paddle wheels turn within a closed  tub of water
The work done as the weight  fell through a given distance would, he  said, all be converted into heat by the fric- tion of the paddles against the water
Joule  used a delicate thermometer to measure the resulting slight increase in the tempera- ture of the water and showed that there  was a constant ratio between the work the  falling weight expended in turning the  paddles and the heat the paddles generated  within the water
Put into standard units,  he found that the fall of 782 pounds  through one foot would raise the tempera- ture of one pound of water by 1°(1) Joules  measurement of the “mechanical value of  heat” became one of the experimental  foundations of the law of the conservation  of energy

understanding and improving steam engines
Carnot and Clapeyron had been  wrong, he said, to claim that steam engines derive their work simply from the  fall of heat from a high temperature to a lower one, the heat (or caloric) itself  being conserved
Joule was confi dent that careful measurements would show  that less heat passes out of the cylinder of a steam engine into its cooling water  and surroundings than enters it from the boiler, and that the difference would  be found to equal the work done by the engine
Moreover, his fi gures indicated  that even the best existing engines converted no more than a tenth of the heat  content of their fuel into useful work
If Joule was right, there was evidently  great scope for improvement
The turning point in Joules quest to be heard came on 24 June 1847 at the  annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,  held that year at (1)(2) Joule was given only a few minutes to describe his  paddle wheel experiments, but that was enough to catch the attention of a  young Scottish scientist in the audience
Still two days shy of his twenty-third  birthday, William Thomson (1824–1907) had already been professor of natural  philosophy at Glasgow University for nearly a year and was widely (and, as we  shall see, rightly) regarded as a rising star of British science
He was deeply  imbued with Carnot and Clapeyrons doctrine of the conservation of heat, but  as he listened, he became convinced that Joule had in fact turned work into  heat
After Joules talk, the two men struck up a conversation that soon matured  into a lasting friendship
Thomson drew other physicists attention to Joules  results, and within a few years the equivalence of work and heat was widely  accepted as an established fact
Thomson was left, however, with a troubling  puzzle: how could Carnot and Joule both be right
If heat was in fact not  conserved, what became of Carnots beautiful theory of the steam engine
Thomson, Clausius, and the Second Law Joule had shown directly that a little under 800 foot-pounds of work could be  turned into 1 Btu of heat, and he was fi rmly convinced that heat could be  converted into work by the same ratio
Steam engines turn heat into work  every day, he said, though with a miserably low efficiency that he hoped to  improve
If Joule was right, however, there seemed to be no reason to stop at  improving the fuel efficiency of steam engines
If lowering the temperature of  a bucket of water by a few degrees could release thousands of foot-pounds of  useful work, why could we not drive our engines by simply tapping the abun- dant heat energy of our surroundings
What keeps us from building a ship that  would take in seawater at the front, turn some of its heat into work, toss ice cubes out the back, and propel itself across the ocean without burning any fuel  at all
Carnot had no doubt been right when he said it was impossible to get  something for nothing in this way, but he had based his argument on the as - sumption that heat is conserved—an assumption Joules experiments had re - futed
If Joule was right, must Carnot be wrong
William Thomson wrestled  with this dilemma through the late 1840s
The German physicist Rudolf Clau- sius took it up as well, and in the early 1850s he and Thomson found slightly  different but ultimately equivalent ways to resolve it
Their solution, soon  dubbed the second law of thermodynamics, had far-reaching implications not  just for the operation of engines but for the fate of the universe
Thomson (known after 1892 as Lord Kelvin) was born in Belfast but grew  up mainly in Scotland, where his father taught mathematics at Glasgow Uni- versity
William was clearly a clever lad, and his ambitious father groomed him  for greatness, starting him in college courses when he was only 10
Thomson  also read widely on his own and published signifi cant papers on the mathemat- ical theory of heat fl ow while still in his teens
In the early decades of the nineteenth century, Glasgow was emerging as a  great industrial center, fi lled with cotton mills and shipyards—along with  slums and smoke
The local industrialists shared a characteristic Scottish con- cern with thrift, economy, and the avoidance of waste
For many, this was a  matter not just of good business but of good morals, refl ecting their adherence  to Presbyterian doctrines of mans responsibility to use Gods gifts wisely and  well
Thomson absorbed these attitudes from an early age, particularly from  his father and his older brother James, who was beginning a career as an engi- neer deeply concerned with the efficiency of water mills and steam engines
When he was 17, Thomson was sent south to study mathematics at Cam- bridge
He spent the next three and a half years preparing for the Mathemati- cal Tripos, a grueling fi ve-day examination widely regarded as the top test of  British brainpower
Although his teachers considered him the most talented  young mathematician of his generation, he came in second on the examina- tion in January 1845; the winner excelled at writing out answers quickly, while  Thomson reportedly spent his time exploring the nuances of the questions  posed, some in fact based on his own published work
The longtime professor of natural philosophy at Glasgow was by then in  failing health, and Thomsons father hoped to land the job for his son
To  bolster his credentials as an experimentalist, William headed to Paris and spent  the spring of 1845 working in the laboratory of Victor Regnault (1810–78), the  leading French experimental physicist of the day
In hopes of improving the efficiency of the countrys steam engines, the French government had com- missioned Regnault to perform extensive experiments on the properties of  steam, and Thomson learned much from him about the physics of heat and  the art of precision measurement
In 1846 Thomson was elected professor of natural philosophy at Glasgow  at the age of 22
In sorting through his predecessors set of disused demonstra- tion apparatus, he came across a model of a Stirling engine, a clever device that  generated work by passing air back and forth between a hot cylinder and a cold  one
The Stirling engine provided perhaps the closest practical embodiment of  Carnots ideal cycle, and Thomsons encounter with the model, and with a  group of Glasgow enthusiasts for similar hot air engines, helped focus his at - tention on problems of work and heat
He had studied Clapeyrons essay while  in Paris and searched without success for a copy of Carnots Refl exions, by then  already rare
Thomson was convinced by Clapeyrons account of Carnots the- ory and accepted the principle of the conservation of heat, though he was open  to the growing evidence that caloric might not be a real substance
In 1848 he  used Carnots theory to construct a new temperature scale based not on the  expansion of mercury or any other substance, but on the principle that the fall  of a given quantity of heat through each degree should produce an equal  amount of work
The resulting “Kelvin scale,” as it was later known, set ab - solute zero at �273°C, at which point a body would contain no heat at all
Thomsons belief in Carnots theory was reinforced when his brother James  pointed out a surprising consequence: since water expands on freezing, apply- ing pressure to a block of ice must lower its melting point, or we could build  a perpetual motion machine driven by the expansion of ice at a constant tem- perature
When William Thomson did the experiment late in 1849, he found  that pressure indeed lowered the melting point of ice by a fraction of a degree,  brilliantly confi rming Carnots theory
By then, however, his encounter with Joule had already led Thomson to  rethink some basic issues
Although willing from the fi rst to grant that Joule  had turned work into heat, he was not convinced the process could run the  other way; as he pointed out, the conversion of heat into work had not yet  been directly demonstrated, and it would contradict Carnots theory
Joule had  proved, however, that heat could not be a sub stance, and he insisted that the  only way to make sense of many experiments on electri cal heating, the com- pression of gases, and other phenomena was to admit that heat actually disap- pears when work is generated
Thomson began to waver; in an 1848 paper he  still cited what he called “Carnots fundamental axiom” of the conservation of heat, but added a footnote calling attention to Joules “remarkable discoveries”  and confessing that “as yet much is involved in mystery” concerning the rela- tionship between heat and work
⁴ Late in 1848 Thomson fi nally obtained a copy of Carnots Refl exions from  his friend Lewis Gordon, professor of engineering at Glasgow and a proponent  of hot air engines
Thomson studied the little book closely and soon published  a detailed account of Carnots theory
His objection to accepting the conver- sion of heat into work crystal lized around a crucial point: if we grant that a  steam engine turns some of the heat from its boiler into work, what are we to  say becomes of the “mechanical effect” that is evi dently lost whenever heat  fl ows from a hot body to a colder one without passing through such an engine
If we were to pipe the steam straight into the condenser, so that it bypassed the  cylinder and did nothing but heat up the cooling water, what would become  of the work that, with more care, we could have extracted from the steam
Like  Faraday and Joule, Thomson believed the powers God had created must be  permanent, and in one of his fi rst uses of the word energy in its modern sense,  he declared that “nothing can be lost in the operations of nature—no energy  can be destroyed
”⁵ Yet if heat and work were truly equivalent, the ordinary  conduction of heat from hot objects to cold ones was destroying motive power  all around us all the time
Thomson was at an impasse
Thomsons paper caught the eye of Rudolf Clausius (1822–88), then a  teacher at a Berlin secondary school and soon to emerge as one of the leading  theoretical physicists in (1)(2) Clausius had already begun to think deeply  about how heat is related to work and motion; as we will see in the next chap- ter, he was a pioneer in developing the kinetic theory of gases, which traces  heat phenomena to the invisible motions of molecules
He accepted Joules  demonstration that work can be converted into heat and opened his 1850 paper “On the Motive Power of Heat” by noting that the advent of the steam  engine had made it natural to ask how much heat it takes to produce a corre- sponding amount of work
He also accepted Carnots proof that the amount  of work that can be derived from a given fl ow of heat depends on the difference  of temperatures through which it falls
Clausius did not accept the conserva- tion of heat, however, and said Thomson had been wrong to identify it as the  foundation of Carnots theory
The real heart of the theory, Clausius argued, lay in Carnots assertion that 4

5

to extract work, we must harness a fl ow of heat from a higher temperature to  a lower one
Indeed, the key point in Clausiuss statement of the second law of  thermodynamics, initially tossed off almost as an aside, was the seemingly  banal observation that, left to itself, heat fl ows only from hotter bodies to  colder ones
We can make heat fl ow in the opposite direction, from cold to  hot, only by a compensating expenditure of work (as is now done in the com- pressor of a refrigerator or air conditioner)
Once we recognize this, Clausius  said, we can readily reconcile Joule with Carnot and put the laws of heat and  work on a sound and comprehensive basis
In particular, we see that there is  no contradiction between Joules claim that as a quantity of heat fl ows from  hot to cold we can convert part of it into work, and Carnots statement that  we must inevitably dump the rest at the lower temperature
All of the energy  we started with will still be there at the end, but the portion that remains as  heat at the lower temperature cannot be turned into work unless we can fi nd  a still colder body for it to fl ow into
Thus, as heat fl ows from hot to cold, less  and less of it remains available to be converted into useful work
Thomson responded to Clausius by publishing a long paper in 1851 in which  he clarifi ed several important points and explored their implications
He now  accepted whole heartedly that heat can be converted into work and formulated  two overarching principles, later codifi ed as the fi rst and second laws of ther- modynamics: (1) heat and work, or what Thomson called “mechanical effect,” are interconvertible according to a set ratio, their sum remaining constant; and  (2) it is impossible to generate work by cooling a body below the temperature  of the coldest body around it
The fi rst of these must be true or we could make  what is called a perpetual motion machine of the fi rst kind, in which work is  produced out of nothing
The second (which, as Thomson noted, is logically  equivalent to Clausiuss principle concerning heat fl ow) must be true or we  could make a perpetual motion machine of the second kind, like the ship de - scribed earlier that sucks heat out of seawater and turns it into work, tossing  out ice cubes along the way
As Thomson noted, if this second principle were  not true, “a self-acting machine might be set to work and produce mechanical  effect by cooling the sea or earth, with no limit but the total loss of heat from  the earth and sea, or, in reality, from the whole material world
”⁶ Indeed, if the  machine expended its work on friction, as a ship does in plowing through the  sea, it would reheat it surroundings, from which it could again draw energy
The machine could run on forever, doing useful work while endlessly recycling 6

the same store of energy
Clausius and Thomson did not so much prove that  such a wonderful device could not be built as take its impossibility for granted  and proceed to trace out the consequences
The laws of thermodynamics, as  formulated by Clausius and Thomson, are in effect very precise and general  statements of the principle that there is no free lunch
Entropy, Dissipation, and Heat Death The formulation of the second law of thermodynamics was rooted in the anal- ysis of heat engines, but its ramifi cations extended far more widely
When the  law was applied to the processes of nature as well as the workings of machines,  it pointed to a grim future in which the active energies of the universe must  inevitably run down
The Scottish geologist James Hutton (1726–97), the fa - ther of uniformitarianism, had declared at the end of the eighteenth century  that the surface of the earth reveals “no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of  an end”; the processes of erosion, sedimentation, and mountain-building had,  he said, been cycling along for unimaginable ages and would continue on into  the indefi  nite future, wearing down the landscape only to build it up again
The developmental evolutionists of the nineteenth century went further, fore- seeing an endless upward progression of living things toward perfection
To  these happy prospects the second law said no, they could not be true
While it  did not rule out local progress that might last millions of years, the second law  decreed that in the end the sun and stars must all burn out, the earth must  cool, and the entire universe must head toward eternal “heat death
” An important step in consolidating the new science of thermodynamics  was the introduction of appropriate terminology
Although Thomson had  occasionally used the word energy as early as 1849, it was another Scotsman,  (1) (1) Macquorn Rankine (1820–72), who in the 1850s brought it into general  use in place of mechanical effect and related expressions
An active engineer and  the author of a widely used textbook on steam engines, Rankine also coined  the term potential energy to distinguish energy that is stored, as in a compressed  spring or a raised weight, from what he called “actual energy,” such as that of  a moving body
Although some critics derided potential energy as little more  than a name for something that had, at least temporarily, passed out of real  existence, Thomson and Joule endorsed the term and it soon came into wide  use
In the 1860s energy of motion came to be known as kinetic energy
The status of heat as a form of energy remained problematic
Although  there was good reason to think that heat was the kinetic energy of molecules,  the second law put strict limits on its convertibility into other forms of energy
Indeed, in the absence of a colder body into which some of the heat could fl ow, there was no way to convert any of the heat in a body into work or anything  else, making it hard to apply to it the usual defi nition of energy as “capacity to  do work
” Joule fell back on defi ning energy as anything that could be con- verted into an equivalent amount of heat
In practice, physicists simply became  familiar enough with energy that most of them no longer felt a need to defi ne  it in terms of anything they regarded as more fundamental
As Clausius cast the laws of thermodynamics into mathematical form in  the early 1850s, he identifi ed an important new quantity to which he initially  gave a rather awkward name: “the equivalence value of a transformation
” In  1865 he renamed it entropy, from the Greek word for “turn” or “transform
”  Consider a quantity of heat passing at a constant temperature from one body  to another, as from the heat reservoir to the cylinder of a Carnot engine
Clau- sius defi ned the change in the entropy (�S ) of a body as the amount of heat  (�Q ) passing into it divided by the temperature T (measured on the absolute,  or Kelvin, scale): �S � �Q /(1) When a quantity of heat enters or leaves a hot  body, the change in the entropy of the body is relatively small; when the same  quantity of heat enters or leaves a cold body, the change in its entropy is rela- tively large, simply because the same quantity of heat is being divided by a  smaller temperature
For a reversible Carnot engine, the change in entropy sums to zero over a  full cycle; a little less heat leaves the cylinder at the lower temperature than  entered it at the higher temperature, and the difference in quantities of heat,  which the engine converts into work, is just enough to make the changes in  entropy at the two temperatures cancel out
In any other process, the net en - tropy increases; in particular, when heat passes directly from a hot body (at  temperature TH) to a colder one (at temperature TC), the cold body always  gains more entropy (�Q /TC) than the hot one loses (�Q /TH), simply because  TH is greater than T(1) As heat fl ows from hot to cold and the entropy of a  system increases, differences of temperature even out, and less and less heat  en  ergy is available to be converted into useful work
The system moves toward  a state of lukewarm equilibrium in which heat can no longer fl ow and activity  comes to a stop
As Clausius put it in his most concise and striking formula- tion of the laws of thermodynamics: (1) the energy of the universe is constant;  (2) the entropy of the universe tends toward a maximum
The cosmic consequences of the inexorable increase in entropy were rec- ognized well before the word itself was coined
In 1852 Thomson published a  short paper with an ominous title: “On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the  Dissipation of Mechanical (1)(2)” Whenever heat fl ows from a hot body to  a colder one by any means except through a perfect reversible engine—and such perfection can never be achieved in any real engine—there is, he said, an  “absolute waste of mechanical energy available to man
” No energy is actually  destroyed, but friction and conduction continually dissipate available energy  into lukewarm heat, from which less and less useful work can be extracted
This fact obligates us, Thomson believed, to strive at all times to minimize  waste and dissipation, while recognizing that we can never eliminate them al - together
It also implies that the world as a whole is running down and so must  have had a beginning and must have an end
As Thomson put it, “Within a  fi nite period of time past, the earth must have been, and within a fi nite period  of time to come the earth must again be, unfi t for the habitation of man as at  present constituted
”⁷ Thomsons conclusion fi t well with his larger view of history, which was  deeply Christian and thus inescapably linear: time, he believed, runs in one  direction from the creation of the world to the incarnation of Christ and on  to the fi nal judgment
This confl icted directly with the cyclic, or uniformi- tarian, view espoused by the geologists James Hutton and Charles Lyell (1797– 1875); indeed, when numbers were put to it, Thomsons position confl icted  even with the milder form of uniformitarianism that did not regard the earth  as truly eternal but held that it had remained essentially unchanged for many  billions of years
As Thomson pointed out, since the earth is warmer than the  surrounding space, it must continually radiate heat in all directions, and mea- surements of the temperature of rocks in deep mines gave a rough indication  of the rate at which heat fl ows up from the interior to replace that lost into  space
In an 1865 paper, “The ‘Doctrine of Uniformity in Geology Briefl y Re - futed,” Thomson took only a few lines to show that the earth could not have  been in its present state for as long as, say, 20 billion years, since at current rates  of fl ow enough heat would have passed outward in that time to have melted  the entire globe many times over
Thomson went on to argue that the earth  can have been cool enough to have a solid crust for no more than a few hun- dred million years, a fi gure he later shaved down to less than 30 million years
Assuming that the sun derives its energy from gravitational contraction, he  also concluded that it can have been shining at its present rate for no more  than about 20 million years and can go on doing so for only a few million  more
Presenting his conclusions as straightforward consequences of the sec- 7

ond law of thermodynamics, Thomson declared in 1862 that “the inhabitants  of the earth cannot continue to enjoy the heat and light essential for their life,  for many million years longer, unless sources now unknown to us are prepared  in the great storehouse of nature
”⁸ Thomsons target was clear: Charles Darwin (1809–82) and his theory of  evolution
Natural selection was clearly a very slow process, and Darwin had  followed Lyell in assuming the earth to be immensely old
In his Origin of   Species (1859), Darwin had ventured an estimate of 300 million years just for  the visible erosion of the Weald, a valley in southern England, while suggest- 8

Artists Conception  of Death by Cold In 1894, the French astronomer and popu- lar writer Camille Flammarion published a  science fi ction novel, La Fin Du Monde, in  which he imagined different ways in which  the world might end
One, pictured here,  appeared to be guaranteed by the second law of thermodynamics: the gradual death  of the sun would eventually plunge the  earth into eternal cold and darkness
� Camille Flammarion, Omega: The Last  Days of the World (New York: Cosmopoli- tan, 1894), p(1); originally published as  La Fin Du Monde (Paris: Flammarion,  1894)
ing that other geological features had been completely worn away, and new  ones had risen on their ruins, unimaginably long before
Thomson objected  strongly to Darwins suggestion that living things are the products of a blind  process of natural selection rather than divine design, and he saw the age of the  earth as the Darwinians weak point
If he could show the earth to be only a  few tens of millions of years old, he thought it would be hard for anyone to  believe that the slow process of natural selection had had enough time to pro- duce all of the complex forms of life, including humans, we see in the world  today
The superior prestige of Thomsons seemingly solid physics overawed  most geologists and biologists of the day, and though Darwin himself felt sure  there must be some fl aw in Thomsons reasoning, most other evolutionists  ac cepted the shorter time scale and simply said, somewhat implausibly, that  evolution must have proceeded much more quickly than they had fi rst thought
Thomsons short limit on the age of the earth was a major problem for Dar- winians in the last decades of the nineteenth century and contributed to a  growing sense at the time that the theory of evolution by natural selection was  in serious  trouble
A few physicists and geologists managed to pick holes in Thomsons as - sumptions and stretch the age of the earth to perhaps a few hundred million  years, but it was only after the discovery of radioactivity in 1896 that the cool- ing rate argument really fell apart
As it became clear that disintegrating atoms  of radium, uranium, and other elements are continually releasing vast amounts  of energy within the earth, and as techniques were developed to use rates of  radioactive decay to determine the age of rocks, Thomson (now the elderly  and very distinguished Lord Kelvin) saw his claims decisively refuted
It be - came evident that the earth is several billion years old, and astrophysicists later  determined that the sun, powered by nuclear reactions in its core, has been  pouring out light and heat for billions of years and is likely to continue on for  billions more
Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937), a pioneer in the study of radioactivity, later  told how in 1904 he spotted Lord Kelvin in the audience at one of his public  lectures
He realized, he said, “that I was in for trouble at the last part of my  speech dealing with the age of the earth, where my views confl icted with his
To my relief, Kelvin fell fast asleep, but as I came to the important point, I  saw the old bird sit up, open an eye and cock a baleful glance at me
Then a  sudden inspiration came, and I said Lord Kelvin had limited the age of the  earth, provided no new source was discovered
That prophetic utterance refers to  what we are now considering tonight, radium
Behold
the old boy beamed upon me
”⁹ Kelvin himself never accepted evolution by natural selection, but  after Rutherfords work, objections to it based on a lack of sufficient time faded  away
Even the discovery of radioactivity only stretched the cosmic time scale,  however; it did not defeat the second law of thermodynamics or erase the chill- ing prospect of universal decline
Even if powered by nuclear reactions, the sun  and stars must eventually exhaust their fuel and fade to darkness
Until then,  living things, including humans, could continue to harness part of the enor- mous fl ow of energy from the hot sun to the cooler earth (and the portion of  that fl ow from previous ages that had been captured by plants and locked up  in deposits of coal and oil), but this must fi nally run out and the world settle  into lukewarm stasis
As Clausius had put it in 1867, as heat fl ows from hot to  cold and entropy rises toward a maximum, “the occasions of further changes  diminish; and supposing this condition to be at last completely attained, no  further change could evermore take place, and the universe would be in a state  of unchanging death
”¹⁰ Thomson cheerily said this should not lead to “dispir- iting views” about the fate of humanity, since “an overruling creative power”  would no doubt act to avert eternal heat death, but short of such divine inter- vention, there seemed to be no escape from the dire consequences of the sec- ond law of thermodynamics
¹¹ All of this raised a basic question, however: what really lay behind the sec- ond law
Why was entropy seemingly fated always to increase
As formulated  by Clausius and Thomson, the second law was simply a generalization from  experience; it asserted that heat never fl ows on its own from a cold body to a  hotter one but did not explain in terms of any underlying theory of heat why  this must be so
Joule and others had provided good grounds for thinking that  heat was the invisible motion of the smallest parts of matter, but this did not  in itself account for the second law or shed much light on why heat fl ows in  the way it does
The move from formulating the empirical laws of energy and  entropy to working out the detailed mechanisms behind them required the  de   velopment of a new branch of physics: kinetic theory

Chaos and Order The formulation of the laws of thermodynamics gave new urgency to an old  question: What is heat
The caloric theory was already in sharp decline by the  late 1840s, and the idea that heat is a manifestation of invisible molecular mo - tions was on the rise
No one was yet sure just what form such motions might  take, however, nor how they might account for known thermal phenomena or  such things as the properties of gases
Why, if heat is simply the motion of  molecules, does it always tend to fl ow from hot to cold, and why are there such  strict limits on the amount that can be converted into other forms of energy
What, at a molecular level, lies behind the second law of thermodynamics and  the seemingly inexorable running down of the world into a sea of lukewarm  heat
The known laws of thermodynamics were essentially just generalizations  from experience; by penetrating to the underlying causal mechanisms, physi- cists hoped to gain deeper insights into what heat really is and why it behaves  as it does
Some even hoped that if they could somehow grasp the detailed  me  chanism of heat, they might be able to fi nd a way around the grim dictates  of the second law and so elude the prospect of universal heat death that other- wise awaits us
The question of the nature of heat prompted some of the most  searching physical inquiries of the second half of the nineteenth century, cul- minating in the formulation of the kinetic theory of gases
The success of the  kinetic theory helped in turn to resurrect one of the oldest and most ambitious  programs of modern science: the effort to explain everything in the physical  world in purely mechanical terms, as consequences simply of the motion of  matter
After some earlier false starts, the kinetic theory of gases made rapid strides  in the 1850s and 1860s
Its fundamental hypothesis was simple: a gas, the the- ory proposed, consists of an enormous number of tiny particles fl ying around  at random, their impacts exerting pressure on any surrounding surfaces and  their motions constituting heat
Although the theory turned out to contain  subtleties that would occupy physicists for decades to come, its main outlines were worked out fairly quickly, chiefl y by Rudolf Clausius and James Clerk  (1)(2) By the late 1860s they had shown that a simple kinetic model could  account for the main phenomena of heat and most of the known properties of  gases and had pointed the way toward more detailed investigations later made  by Ludwig Boltzmann and others
These theoretical investigations, and the ex - periments that went with them, bolstered the growing belief in the physical  reality of atoms
They also cast the second law of thermodynamics into a new  and revealing light, in which the law appeared as a matter of statistical prob- ability rather than as an absolute physical truth
Perhaps most tellingly of all,  the kinetic theory of gases showed that, when examined closely, even  seemingly  solid and precise laws of nature might turn out to be founded not on the work- ings of a neat and orderly underlying clockwork, but on molecular chaos
The Gas Laws and Early Kinetic Theories Scientifi c study of the physical properties of air and gases got its start in the  seventeenth century
Experiments with barometers and air pumps established  that air can be compressed and rarefi ed, and pointed toward a mathematical  relation ship between pressure and volume
In 1662 the English natural philos- opher Robert Boyle (1627–91) published results that were later codifi ed as  “Boyles law”: as the pressure on a quantity of air is increased, its volume de - creases proportionally, so that if, for instance, the pressure is doubled, the vol- ume is cut in half
Expressed algebraically, the law states that P • V � a con- stant
Boyle hedged his initial statement with qualifi cations, presenting it not  as an exact and universal law but as a tentative and limited empirical general- ization
The law nonetheless fi t the actual behavior of gases very well and later  proved of great practical value, not least to James Watt in his work on the steam  engine
Strictly speaking, Boyles law holds only for constant temperatures, for it  had long been known that air expands when heated and contracts when cooled
Indeed, some of the fi rst thermometers devised in the seventeenth century  used the expansion and contraction of a column of air to indicate changes in  temperature, though these soon gave way to the more convenient and now  more familiar glass tube fi lled with mercury
In 1802 a young Laplacian chem- ist, Joseph Gay-Lussac (1778–1850), carefully measured the thermal expansion  of gases and showed that the pressure of a gas held at a constant volume in - creases in proportion to the rise in temperature
Combining Boyles law with  Gay-Lussacs yielded P • V � r (T � C ), where r is a constant, T is the tem- perature, and C is a constant that depends on the scale used, about 273° for the  Celsius scale or 460° on the Fahrenheit scale
If Gay-Lussacs law held true all the way down, one would thus expect the pressure of a gas to fall to zero at  around �273°C or �460°F, the “absolute zero” of the later Kelvin scale
Gay-Lussac emphasized the practical value of his law for measuring the  heat released or absorbed in chemical reactions, gauging variations in the den- sity of the atmosphere, and analyzing the workings of steam engines
Like  other Laplacians, he viewed heat phenomena through the lens of the caloric  theory and so saw the thermal expansion of gases as a very simple process: each  of the stationary particles of a gas is surrounded, the theory said, by a repulsive  cushion of caloric, and as more caloric is added, these cushions grow fatter,  pushing the particles of gas farther apart
Conversely, when the gas is com- pressed, excess caloric is almost literally squeezed out and fl ows away as heat
The caloric theory could explain a wide range of phenomena with consider- able precision, and it dominated most thinking about heat and gases in the late  eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
The alternative view of heat as a  form of motion never entirely disappeared, however
Francis Bacon and John  Locke had been among its advocates in the seventeenth century, and it re - mained a respectable minority view even when the caloric theory was at its  height during the Laplacian decades of the late eighteenth and early nine- teenth centuries
The motional theory was, however, generally regarded as  poorly suited to mathematical treatment and as too speculative to be accepted  as true
The kinetic theory of gases was initially pursued independently of theories  of heat, most notably by the Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (1700– 1782)
In 1738, Bernoulli suggested that a volume of air could be pictured as a  box fi lled with tiny particles bouncing around at random
He easily derived  Boyles law, showing that if we reduce the volume of the box, the pressure will  increase proportionally, simply because, with a shorter distance to travel, the  particles will strike the walls more often
He also showed that the pressure  would increase with temperature and would be proportional to the mass of the  particles and the square of their velocity
To later eyes, this might suggest a  connection between vis viva and heat, but Bernoulli did not pursue the point
Bernoullis theory attracted little support in the eighteenth century, perhaps  because scientifi c tastes were shifting away from devising hypothetical mecha- nisms and toward formulating descriptive mathematical laws
The discovery at  mid-century that “latent heat” is apparently stored and released during changes  of phase, as when steam condenses or water vaporizes, also seemed difficult to  explain on the kinetic theory, while it fi t well with the image of caloric being  stored by molecules
The kinetic theory of gases began its halting reemergence in the early de - cades of the nineteenth century, initially through the efforts of John Herapath  (1790–1868), an English mathematics teacher
Self-taught, pugnacious, and  ec    centric, Herapath knew little of earlier work on kinetic theory, but in the  1810s he independently rederived Bernoullis results on the relationship between  pressure and volume in a gas consisting of hard particles in random motion
He went beyond Bernoulli by explicitly identifying the motion of these par- ticles as heat and deriving various consequences for the thermal properties of  gases, but the value of this work was undercut by Herapaths erroneous defi ni- tion of temperature as proportional to the speed of the particles rather than its  square
In 1820 he sent a long account of his theory to the Royal Society of  London, which rejected it as too speculative
Although he managed to get the  paper published elsewhere, Herapath long nursed a grudge against the so - ciety, whose rejection he rightly believed had damaged his scientifi c reputa- tion
After becoming editor of a railway trade journal in the 1830s, he used its  pages to air his grievances and disseminate more of his theoretical results
By  then, however, he was widely regarded as a crank, and his massive Mathemati- cal Physics, published in 1847, attracted little favorable scientifi c notice
James  Joule, himself something of a scientifi c outsider in those days, was one of the  few to take it up, in 1848 publishing a calculation of the speed of a gas molecule  (about 6,225 feet per second for hydrogen at 60°F) that drew heavily on Hera- paths ideas
The next important proponent of the kinetic theory had even worse luck  than (1)(2) (1) (1) Waterston (1811–83) was a Scottish engineer and mathe- matics teacher; from 1839 to 1857 he taught at an East India Company school  in (1)(2) There, he not only independently retraced most of Bernoulli and  Herapaths steps but carried kinetic theory substantially further, particularly by  linking temperature to the square of the velocity of the particles and deriving  many of the known thermal properties of gases
Waterstons results fi rst ap - peared as an appendix to a book on the workings of the central nervous system  that he published anonymously in 1843; not surprisingly, this attracted no  notice from physicists
Two years later, he sent a long paper on kinetic theory  to the Royal Society, but the mathematicians who examined it recommended  against publication, one declaring it to be “nothing but nonsense, unfi t even  for reading before the (1)(2)”¹ Under the rules then in force, rejected papers  were relegated to the archives of the society, and Waterston, who had not re - tained a full copy of his paper, was unable even to get it returned

(Amsterdam: North Holland,  1976), 1:145
Such treatment left Waterston understandably bitter, and though he pub- lished several shorter accounts of his ideas over the next few years, he eventually  turned his attention to other issues
There is reason to think that some of  Waterstons ideas seeped into the thinking of other scientists, but his main  work on kinetic theory remained almost wholly unknown until 1891, when the  physicist Lord Rayleigh, then serving as secretary of the Royal Society, came  across the rejected 1845 paper in the archives, recognized its merit, and ordered  it published in the Philosophical Transactions of the society
The scientifi c world  fi nally recognized that Waterston had been more than a decade ahead of sub- sequent work on the kinetic theory of gases
This acclaim came too late for  Waterston himself, how ever; he had died in 1883, apparently washed off a  breakwater while walking near his home in (1)(2)
The Kinetic Theory of Gases: Clausius and Maxwell Herapath and Waterston aside, modern kinetic theory got its lasting start in  the late 1850s at the hands of Rudolf Clausius and James Clerk (1)(2) Over  the next decade, they showed that a simple model of particles fl ying around at  random not only could account for most of the known properties of heat and  gases but also led to new results that could be confi rmed experimentally
Clau- sius and Maxwell also took the fi rst steps toward treating molecular motions Kinetic Model of a Box of Air As initially conceived by Daniel Bernoulli  and others in the eighteenth century, the  kinetic theory pictured the molecules in a  box of air bouncing around at random,  their collisions with the walls being felt as the pressure of the air
If we were to reduce  the volume of the box, the molecules  would have a shorter distance to go and so  would hit the walls more often, increasing  the pressure proportionately
The theory  could thus readily account for Boyles law  and other simple gas laws
statistically, showing that many of the measurable properties of gases result  from averaging together the varying attributes of enormous numbers of in - dividual particles
By the mid-1860s the kinetic theory of gases no longer lay  at the speculative fringe of science but had become a respected and rapidly de - veloping area of research
In an ironic twist, the development of modern kinetic theory was sparked  not by Herapath and Waterstons impressive writings but by a much less sub- stantial paper by a German chemist, August Krönig, that appeared in 1856
Like Bernoulli, Krönig began by deriving Boyles law from a simple model of  particles in motion, though he garbled the numerical factors so badly that he  ended up claiming that the pressure a quantity of air exerts on the ground  amounts to only half its weight
He also derived Gay-Lussacs law and several  other results, but he seems to have had a poor grasp of his own theory, and there  is reason to think that he may have drawn much of it from a muddled reading  of a paper of Waterstons he had come across in his role as editor of a German  journal that published accounts of foreign scientifi c publications
Flawed as it  was, Krönigs paper appeared at a time when physicists were in  creasingly con- vinced that heat must be a form of motion and were casting around for ideas  about what form that motion might take
His paper helped bring kinetic the- ory back into scientifi c discussion; most importantly, it prompted Clausius to  publish ideas he had been pursuing privately for years
Clausius said later that even before he published his fi rst paper on thermo- dynamics in 1850, he believed that heat was a form of motion and had begun  to explore the workings of kinetic models of gases
He kept these early inves- tigations to himself, in part because he did not think they were yet conclusive  enough to publish, and in part because he wanted to keep his strict reasoning  about the general principles of thermodynamics separate from any speculative  hypotheses about the unseen motions of molecules
Krönigs paper fi nally  pushed him into print, and early in 1857 Clausius brought out a paper bearing  the intriguing title “The Kind of Motion We Call (1)(2)” As this phrase sug- gests, and as one might expect from a founder of thermodynamics, Clausius  focused on what kinetic theory could say about heat phenomena and the ther- mal properties of gases
He corrected various of Krönigs mathematical errors  and emphasized that while the temperature and pressure of a gas arise from the  linear motions of its molecules, their rotations and internal vibrations account  for a signifi cant part of their total kinetic energy and so of the total heat
By  measuring how much the temperature of a quantity of gas rises when a given  amount of heat is added to it at constant volume and then under constant  pressure, we can deduce, Clausius said, that linear motion accounts for just under two-thirds of the kinetic energy of a typical gas molecule, the remainder  being split between rotational and perhaps vibrational motions
Here, Clau- sius was treading on what would become a persistent problem for the kinetic  theory of gases: as we will see, the theory predicted a value for the “ratio of  specifi c heats” that differed signifi cantly from that found by experiment
The  discrepancy would not be fully resolved until the advent of quantum theory in  the twentieth century
Clausius approached most problems in kinetic theory by trying to fi nd the  average value of a quantity and then treating all particles as if they shared that  value
This greatly simplifi ed the mathematics and allowed him to calculate  such things as the speed of a typical molecule—which, by reasoning much like  Joules, he found to range from about 470 meters per second (1550 feet per  second) for an oxygen molecule at room tempera ture to about 1900 meters per  second (6200 feet per second) for a much lighter hydrogen molecule
Clausius  knew that the actual speed of any individual molecule might well be signifi - cantly more or less than this average value, but he put this fact to use only  once, in his theory of evaporation
The molecules in a liquid jostle one an - other, he said, but unlike those in a gas, they generally lack the speed needed  to break free and travel any appreciable distance on their own
Occasionally,  however, a molecule near the surface of a liquid may chance to acquire just  enough speed to overcome the attraction of its neighbors and fl y off into space,  carrying its kinetic energy with it and thus cooling the liquid by evaporation
Clausius explained latent heats of vaporization and condensa tion in a sim- ilar way and so answered what had been a nagging objection to the kinetic  theory
When heat is added to a liquid near its boiling point, he said, the  energy does not immediately raise the temperature but instead goes into over- coming the attractive forces between the molecules
As molecules fl y off to  form a vapor, part of their kinetic energy is stored, or becomes “latent,” as the  potential energy of these attractive forces
This latent heat is recovered when  the vapor condenses and the molecules “fall” back toward each other, convert- ing the potential energy of their attractive forces into the kinetic energy, or  heat, of the molecules in the liquid
Clausiuss paper was generally well received, but a critic soon raised a tell- ing objection: why, if molecules in the air are traveling at hundreds of meters  per second, does it take a minute or more for the odor from, say, an open  bottle of ammonia to diffuse across a room
One would think the ammonia  molecules would fl y to every corner of the room in a fraction of a second
Clausius answered that before any molecule can go very far it will inevitably  collide with another and ricochet off in a new direction
He intro duced the concept of “mean free path,” the average distance a molecule travels between  collisions, and though unable to put a fi rm number on it, he showed that it  must be a tiny fraction of a millimeter
A molecule of ammonia will thus col- lide with a neighbor and completely change its direction billions of times each  second; even banging around at hundreds of meters per second, it will thus  take some time to make its way across a room
The next major step in the development of kinetic theory was taken by  James Clerk Maxwell (1832–79), now widely regarded as the greatest physicist  of the nineteenth century
His father was a Scottish landowner who dabbled  in science, and his mother, who died when Maxwell was only eight, came from  an intellectually distinguished Edinburgh family
Maxwell was educated fi rst  at Edinburgh and then at Cambridge; like William Thomson, later his good  friend, he fi nished second on the Mathematical Tripos examination
He be - came known as a talented though sometimes sloppy mathematician and as the  possessor of an extraordinary insight into physical processes
In 1859 Maxwell was a young professor at Aberdeen in northern Scotland  when he read Clausiuss paper on the mean free path of molecules and decided  to tackle the kinetic theory as what he called “an exercise in mechanics
”² He  began by assuming gas molecules to be small, hard, perfectly elastic spheres— not because he thought they were likely really to be such simple “billiard balls,”  acting on each other only by contact, but because the model was defi nite and  he could readily investigate its consequences
He had no trouble showing, as  others had before him, that a gas made up of such particles would obey Boyles  and Gay-Lussacs laws and that, as chemical evidence suggested, equal volumes  of two different gases held at the same temperature and pressure would contain  equal numbers of molecules
From viscosity measurements, he was able to esti- mate the mean free path of a molecule in air to be about 1⁄447,000 of an inch, or  less than a ten-thousandth of a millimeter
Maxwell next took a step that put kinetic theory on the path it has fol- lowed ever since: abandoning all hope of tracking the paths of individual gas  particles, he turned to statistical methods to characterize how they would be - have in groups
In this he was infl uenced by recent work in the social sciences,  particularly that of the Belgian astronomer-turned-sociologist  Adolphe Quete- let (1796–1874)
Drawing on techniques developed to average out errors in  astronomical observations, Quetelet had devoted great efforts to delineating  the characteristics of the “average man” as revealed by government statistics

The word statistics, in fact, comes from that for “state”; it originally referred  only to the collection and tabulation of population and trade fi gures about a  country, and only gradually came to be applied to the analysis of quantitative  data of other kinds
Nineteenth-century statisticians emphasized that even  when we do not have detailed information about individuals in a population,  we can still make useful statements about averages
For large groups, such aver- ages are often remarkably stable even when the causes of individual events are  unknown and highly variable; as statisticians liked to point out, the number  of letters posted without an address changes little from week to week, even  though the reasons that someone might forget, in any particular case, to ad - dress a letter before mailing it are completely capricious
The orderly patterns that statisticians were able to extract from collections  of random events—in particular, the “bell curve,” or normal distribution of  values around a mean—gave Maxwell a powerful tool he could bring to bear  on gas theory: many observable properties such as temperature and pressure  are, he said, simply stable averages arising from chaotic underlying processes
Clausius had gone as far as to calculate the average values, such as the mean  free path and the mean molecular speed, that result from random collisions
Maxwell went further, shifting the focus from the average to the deviations  from it and working out how molecular velocities are distributed around the  mean
As the particles in a box of gas collide with each other and with the sur- rounding walls, they change their speeds and directions in ways that, though  strictly determined by Newtons laws of motion, are effectively random, since  they depend on slight and unknown differences in the initial positions and  motions of the particles
By assuming the motions along each of the three  directional axes to be completely random and independent, Maxwell was able  in 1859 to derive the curve describing how the speeds of the particles in a gas  will be distributed; essentially, he simply combined the normal bell curves for  velocities along each of the axes
The overall shape of the curve was given by a  general formula, but its steepness and the location of its peak depended on the  temperature: the higher the temperature, and thus the higher the average speed  of the particles, the further out the peak lay along the curve
Maxwells distri- bution curve clearly showed that the speeds of particles are spread on either  side of the mean and that even a fairly cold gas contains some molecules that  are moving faster than most of those in a gas at a higher temperature
This fact  had some remarkable consequences, as we shall see
Maxwells fi rst attempts to use his billiard ball model and speed distribu- tion curve to analyze the diffusion of gases and the conduction of heat were marred by several mathematical mistakes, as Clausius soon pointed out; at one  point, for instance, Maxwell forgot to convert from hours to seconds when he  was calculating rates of heat fl ow
Maxwell had better luck with viscosity, or  gaseous friction, correctly showing that in a gas made up of billiard ball par- ticles the viscosity would increase with the square root of the temperature  (measured from absolute zero) and, surprisingly, would be independent of the  density
That a very thin gas would produce as much frictional resistance as a  dense one was, as Maxwell admitted, “certainly very unexpected,” but it fol- lowed in the theory from the way the longer mean free path of molecules at  low density acted to spread the friction over more of the surrounding space
When Maxwell published his fi rst paper on kinetic theory early in 1860, he thought it likely that experiments would contradict his predictions about  viscosity and so prove the billiard ball model to be wrong
Indeed, he already  knew that the model could not be quite right, since it required the kinetic  energy of the molecules of most gases to be equally divided between linear and  rotational motions and so led to a fi gure for the ratio of specifi c heats that did  not fi t measured values
Existing measurements said little about how the vis- cosity of air might vary with temperature and density, so Maxwell decided to  do the experiments himself
In 1860 Maxwell lost his position at Aberdeen when the two colleges there The Maxwell Distribution  of Speeds in Gas In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell used statisti- cal principles and the laws of probability to  work out a formula that showed how, in a  given volume of gas, the number of mole- cules traveling at a specifi ed speed would vary with temperature
Here, we see the  resulting curves for a low temperature, T1, and a higher temperature, T2
The spread  of speeds for each temperature shows us  that even a relatively cold gas must contain  a signifi cant number of molecules that are  moving faster than some of the molecules  in a hotter gas
were merged
He soon landed a new professorship at Kings College in Lon- don, where, as we will see in Chapter 5, he collaborated on an important series  of experiments to determine the value of the ohm, the unit of electrical resis- tance
During this work, Maxwell noticed how air resistance slowly damped  the oscillations of a swinging needle, and he realized that this could provide an  accurate way to measure the viscosity of air: he could simply time the decaying  swings of a set of discs twisting back and forth at the end of a long wire
In the  mid-1860s, assisted by his wife, Katherine, and working mainly in the attic of  their London home, Maxwell made the measurements and found that the  viscosity of air increases directly with the temperature rather than with its  square root, contradicting the fi rst prediction of his billiard ball model
When  he varied the density, however, he found that his second and more surprising  prediction was brilliantly confi rmed: dense air turned out to offer no more  frictional resistance than did thin air
This result was hard to explain except on  some version of the kinetic theory, and while Maxwells experiments made it  clear that molecules could not be simple billiard ball particles, they greatly  bolstered the case for accepting the broader kinetic theory
In 1866 Maxwell returned to kinetic theory in an important paper “On the  Dynamical Theory of (1)(2)” Responding to Clausiuss earlier criticisms, he  now tackled diffusion, heat conduction, and other phenomena with mathe- matical tools far more general and powerful than those he had used in 1859
As  we shall see in later chapters, Maxwell followed a similar pattern in his work  on electromagnetic theory: as he turned a problem over and over in his mind,  he systematically moved back and forth between highly specifi c mechanical  models, like his 1859 billiard ball model of a gas, and more general theories  based on broad dynamical principles, as in his 1866 paper
He never gave up  his goal of fi nding a complete mechanical explanation, but he continually  strove to see how far he could go in formulating the general laws governing  phenomena without invoking any detailed hypothesis
In his “Dynamical  Theory of Gases,” Maxwell showed that almost any theory of how molecules  might act on each other led to the viscosity of a gas being independent of its  density
The observed direct dependence of viscosity on temperature, by con- trast, followed only if one assumed that, instead of colliding like billiard balls,  the molecules repel each other at very short distances with a force that falls  off with the fi fth power of the distance between them
(Clausius had already  shown that molecules evidently exert a weak attractive force on each other over  somewhat greater distances
) Maxwell left for later the question of exactly how,  in mechanical terms, these short-range forces might be produced, but he showed  that assuming an inverse fi fth-power repulsion made complicated terms in the equations cancel each other out, greatly simplifying the mathematics and al - lowing viscosity and heat conduction results to be calculated exactly
In his 1866 paper, Maxwell also returned to the question of how molecular  speeds are distributed
Instead of relying on his earlier and admittedly pre- carious assumption that speeds along different axes are completely indepen- dent, he now offered a more rigorous derivation based on analyzing the results  of collisions
He arrived at the same distribution he had found before and  showed that it would be stable, in that further collisions between the particles  would not change the overall spread of their speeds
He also argued that no  matter how the speeds of the particles in a box of gas are initially distributed— if those in one part are moving very quickly, for instance, while those in another  are moving more slowly—they will, as they collide and exchange energy, move  toward the standard distribution
Here was a hint of a kinetic explanation of  the second law of thermodynamics: the tendency of heat to fl ow from hot to  cold, and the resulting rise in entropy, might be simply a consequence of the  way collisions tend to average out the differing speeds of particles, bringing  them into the stable distribution that corresponds to a lukewarm intermediate  temperature
Mix fast-moving particles with slow-moving ones and you get a  lot of particles moving at middling speeds; it seemed simple enough
As Max- well soon discovered, however, the real connection between the kinetic theory  and the second law is far more subtle and complex than that
Maxwells Demon By the late 1860s, the kinetic theory of gases appeared to be on a solid footing
The gas laws and many of the known thermal and mechanical properties of  gases had been shown to follow from a simple model of particles in random  motion, and since the kinetic theory treated heat as simply the mechanical  energy of these particles, the theory was clearly compatible with the fi rst law  of thermodynamics: no matter how the particles might collide with one an - other, their total energy would be conserved
Maxwells discussion of how any  mix of molecular speeds would quickly converge toward his standard distribu- tion suggested that the second law, too, might follow fairly readily from the  kinetic model
As physicists looked more closely, however, they began to see problems
In  Thomsons formulation, the second law decrees that it is impossible to pro- duce work by cooling a body below the temperature of the coldest body near  it
If heat is simply molecular motion, however, there is no obvious reason why  we should not be able to lay hold of each molecule and, in the process of bring- ing it to rest, convert all of its motion—that is, all of its heat energy—into use ful work
If the kinetic theory is right, it seems we should be able to build  an engine that would take in seawater, extract its heat, throw out ice cubes, and  drive a ship across the ocean without consuming any fuel at all
Something  about “the kind of motion we call heat” evidently makes this impossible—but  what
How can the second law and the kinetic theory both be true
The fi rst  step toward solving this puzzle lay with one of the most intriguing characters  in nineteenth-century physics, a tiny imaginary being who came to be known  as “Maxwells demon
” To better understand the tensions between kinetic theory and the second  law, we should fi rst look more closely at how the kinetic theory explains the  ordinary fl ow of heat
Picture a box of air divided by a partition into a cool  side (A) and a hot side (B)
If we were to connect the two sides through a heat  engine we could, by a cycle of operations like Carnots, extract useful work  from the fl ow of heat from B to (1) Now imagine that instead of hooking up  such an engine we simply poke a hole through the partition and let the air on  the two sides mix together
Fast-moving molecules from B will pass into A and,  as they collide, impart some of their kinetic energy to the slower molecules  there; similarly, slow-moving molecules from A will pass into B and absorb  energy as they are struck by the faster molecules on that side
Initially, the  curves describing how molecular speeds are distributed on the two sides will  have distinct peaks corresponding to their different temperatures, but as the  mixing continues these will coalesce into a single curve with a peak about  midway between the initial values
In other words, A will heat up and B will  cool down until both sides end up at a single intermediate temperature
The  total kinetic energy, or heat, of the air in the box will not change, but its en - tropy will increase, and the work we could have extracted by hooking up a heat  engine will no longer be available to us
Heat conduction is, in thermo dynamic  terms, a one-way process; in kinetic theory, it results from a mixing that evi- dently cannot be undone
Or can it
The laws of impact are all time-reversible; any collision that can  happen in one direction could just as well happen in the other
What if, after  the mixing is complete, we were suddenly and accurately to reverse the motion  of every particle in the box
(We can imagine placing innumerable tiny elastic  barriers within the box so that all of the particles simultaneously hit them and  bounce straight back
) Everything would now run backward: molecules from  B that had lost energy through collisions would regain it, while those from A would lose all they had gained; heat would fl ow spontaneously from A back  toward B, making it hotter and violating the second law
In short, the whole  scene would look like a movie run in reverse
As William Thomson remarked  in an 1874 article, “The Kinetic Theory of the Dissipation of Energy,” if we could somehow reverse all molecular motions, some very odd things would  occur: “The bursting bubble of foam at the foot of a waterfall would reunite  and descend into the water; the thermal motions would reconcentrate their  energy, and throw the mass up the fall in drops re-forming into a close column  of ascending water
”³ Life itself would run backwards: as Maxwell noted in a  December 1870 letter to (1) (1) Strutt (later Lord Rayleigh), we would “see all  [our] friends passing from the grave to the cradle till we our selves become the  reverse of born, whatever that is
”⁴ None of this would violate the laws of  mechanics, but it would completely contradict the second law of thermo- dynamics, as well as our ordinary experience
Maxwell drily told Strutt that “the possibility of executing this experiment 3

Mixing Hot and Cold Air If we let a box of hot air mix with a box of  cold air, we get a box of lukewarm air
According to the kinetic theory, this occurs  because collisions between the molecules  average out their speeds; the previously  distinct curves showing how speeds are dis- tributed in each box merge to form a single  intermediate curve
No energy has been lost, but the opportunity to extract useful  work from the fl ow of heat from hot to  cold has slipped away; energy has been  conserved, but entropy has increased
Moreover, this averaging out of tempera- tures is evidently a one-way process; left to  itself, a box of lukewarm air will not spon- taneously separate itself into a hot side and  a cold side
is doubtful,” but added that much less than full reversal would suffice “to upset  the 2nd law of (1)(2)” He then gave a very clear account of a  thought experiment he had fi rst proposed in a letter to his friend (1) (1) Tait  three years before, and of the imaginary being Thomson was soon to dub  “Maxwells demon
” Consider again our box of air
Once it has been thor- oughly mixed, the temperature and thus the average speed of the molecules  will be the same on both sides, though as we have seen, some will be moving  faster than the average and some more slowly
Now equip the connecting hole  with a door and a tiny doorkeeper—Maxwell never liked the term “demon,”  for the creature need not possess any supernatural powers, just keen eyesight  and quick reactions; nonetheless, the name stuck and we will use it here
When the demon sees a molecule approaching from side A that is going  faster than the average, he lets it through into B; when he sees one going more  slowly, he closes the door and keeps it on side (1) Conversely, when he sees a  slower-than-average molecule approaching from side B, he lets it through into  A, while keeping any faster ones bottled up in (1) With time, most of the faster  molecules will end up in B and the slower ones in (1) Without doing any work  on the molecules, but simply by opening and closing a tiny door, the demon  has been able to sort the lukewarm air in the box into a hot side and a cold  side, reducing the entropy and violating the second law of thermodynamics
If  we were now to let the heat reconcentrated in B fl ow through a heat engine  into A, we could extract useful work; with help from our little doorkeeper, we  could thus turn an ordinary box of air into a perpetual motion machine of the  second kind
At about the same time Maxwell was inventing his demon, the Austrian  physicist Josef Loschmidt (1821–95) was pursuing his own doubts about the  universal validity of the second law
Instead of positing an intelligent door- keeper, Loschmidt noted that if at any moment we knew the exact motion of  every molecule in a box of air, we could predict all of their future motions and,  by opening and closing a door at just the right times, could separate the faster  molecules from the slower ones and so cause heat to fl ow from a cooler place  to a hotter one
He concluded that there must be a loophole in the second law  and that fears of universal heat death were thus misplaced
Though he could  not say quite how to do it in practice, Loschmidt was convinced there must be  a way to reverse the dissipation of energy, and that we would thus have “an  inexhaustible supply of transformable heat at hand in all ages
”⁵ If we could 5

just fi gure out the trick, we need never again burn coal or any other fuel but  could continually draw useful work from the ambient heat around us
Maxwell held out no such cheery hopes
He knew that we have no sharp- eyed, quick-fi ngered demons to call upon and no prospect of gaining detailed  knowledge of the motions of all of the molecules in even a small box of gas
His aim was not to evade the second law but to shed light on its true meaning
Maxwells Demon In 1867, James Clerk Maxwell introduced  an imaginary “demon” as a way to illus- trate the statistical nature of the second law  of thermodynamics
Imagine a box of air  divided into two parts, with a tiny  “demon” standing guard at a small door  between them
The demon, gifted with  nothing more than keen vision and quick  reaction times, is able to detect how fast  individual molecules are going and can  open and close the door as needed
Begin- ning with the entire box at a uniform luke- warm temperature, he sets out to separate  the faster-moving “hot” molecules from  the slower-moving “cold” ones
When he  sees a fast-moving molecule heading  toward the left, he opens the door and lets  it through; when he sees a slower molecule  heading that way, he keeps the door closed
Conversely, when he sees a slow-moving  molecule heading toward the right, he lets  it through, while closing the door on any  faster molecules and keeping them con- fi ned to the left side
Over time, the  demon is thus able to gather all of the  faster “hot” molecules on the left side of  the box and all of the slower “cold” ones  on the right, simply by opening and clos- ing the door at the right times
Such a separation of hot from cold  without any net expenditure of work  would violate the second law
Moreover,  once the demon had separated the hot and  cold portions of air for us, we could con- nect the two sides through a heat engine  and proceed to extract useful work as the  heat fl owed on its own from the hot side  to the cold side
We would thus, in  thermo dynamic terms, have been able to  get something for nothing
His demon argument showed, he believed, that the second law  is fundamen- tally statistical and refl ects not so much the intrinsic nature of the physical  world as the limits on our knowledge of molecular motions
The second law  would have no meaning for a being who was unable to harness any of the ener- gies of the world around it, Maxwell said, nor would it apply to one who, like  his demon, “could trace the motion of every molecule and seize it at the right  moment
” The second law is, in a sense, a very human law, appropriate to our  middling place in the scale of things: “It is only to a being in the interme diate  stage,” Maxwell said, “who can lay hold of some forms of energy while others  elude his grasp, that energy appears to be passing inevitably from the avail- able to the dissipated state
”⁶ It is only for us that heat appears as a distinct  form of dissipated energy, into which all others are continually and irreversibly   slipping
Boltzmann, Gibbs, and Statistical Mechanics Although Maxwell had made a persuasive case for regarding the second law as  ultimately statistical rather than absolute, he left the detailed proof of this  claim to others
Ludwig Boltzmann and later (1) Willard Gibbs were among  those who took up what proved to be the challenging task of showing exactly  how and why molecular motions lead to increases in entropy
Between the  1870s and the turn of the century, they developed what came to be known  as statistical mechanics, a sophisticated set of mathemat ical techniques that  greatly illuminated the molecular foundations of thermodynamics and the  relationship between disorder and entropy
Along the way they encountered  controversies over not just the validity of kinetic theory, but the reality of  atoms themselves
Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) was born and educated in Vienna and  spent most of his career teaching at universities there and in Graz, (1)(2)  High-strung and emotionally volatile, he would probably now be regarded as  manic depressive or bipolar
He attempted suicide more than once and eventu- ally hanged himself when he was 62
Before his bouts of depression became too  debilitating, however, he led an active career as a teacher, experimenter, and  theorist
He worked in many areas of physics, including optics and electro- magnetism, but following the lead of his friend and teacher Josef Loschmidt,  he devoted his greatest efforts to kinetic theory and related areas of molecular  science

Boltzmanns fi rst signifi cant work, published when he was just 22, was an  attempt to derive the second law of thermodynamics directly from the laws of  mechanics, as Helmholtz had done for the fi rst law nearly 20 years before
Although he brought out some intriguing mechanical analogies to entropy in  systems that run in repetitive cycles, like orbiting planets or swinging pen- dulums, such cases were not central to thermodynamics
The real interest in  thermodynamics lay in irreversible processes, particularly the fl ow of heat from  hot to cold, and Boltzmann gradually came to see that explaining such changes  would require something beyond just the laws of mechanics
Although he never met or even corresponded with Maxwell, Boltzmann  greatly admired the Scottish physicists writings on kinetic theory
In 1868, he  generalized Maxwells formula for molecular velocities to take into account  external forces such as gravitation and so was led to what physicists still call the  “Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
” Four years later, he followed this achieve- ment with a paper in which he fl eshed out Maxwells originally rather sketchy  argument that the distribution formula represented an equilibrium toward  which any other state of molecular motion would evolve over time
Boltzmann  defi ned a new quantity, later known as H, that gave a measure of how far a  given set of speeds deviated from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution; he  then showed that as particles collide and exchange energy, the value of H will fall until, at zero, the particles reach their stable distribution
In fact,  Boltzmann argued, H is just another name for the entropy, S (with a change  of sign, so that H � �S ), and a falling value of H represents the fl ow of heat  toward thermal equilibrium
By combining mechanics with statistics, he had  at last succeeded in deriving the second law from more fundamental princi- ples
Boltzmanns “H–theorem” of 1872 is now recognized as one of the great  achievements of kinetic theory
Boltzmann initially believed his theorem proved that H must always de - crease, just as entropy always increases
Loschmidt, however, raised a telling  objection, essentially the one Maxwell and Thomson had raised earlier by in - voking their imaginary demon
If we were suddenly to reverse the velocities of  every particle in a box of air, Loschmidt said, would not H then begin to in - crease and entropy to decrease
How could Boltzmann claim that every  possible  state of molecular motion must evolve toward the Maxwell-Boltzmann distri- bution, when here was a case that clearly ran in exactly the opposite  direction
Boltzmann conceded Loschmidts point, but insisted that such states of  increasing H are extremely unlikely
Consider a deck of cards, initially neatly  stacked from ace of spades to two of clubs
As we shuffle them together, the  cards become less ordered until after a few shuffles their sequence is, to all ap - pearances, completely random and further shuffling has no evident effect
This  state of equilibrium corresponds to H falling to zero and the entropy rising to  a maximum
If we keep shuffling, however, the cards may, simply by chance,  fall back into their original order
It could happen—but dont bet on it
The  likelihood of the cards spontaneously falling into any particular order can be  calculated: for a deck of 52 cards, the probability that they will line up on their  own from highest to lowest is about one in 8 � 1067
(For comparison, the  universe is only about 4 � 1017 seconds old
) Similarly, as the particles in a box  of air randomly bounce around, all of the faster ones might, simply by chance,  end up on one side and all of the slower ones on the other
That is, if the  kinetic theory is true, a lukewarm box of air might spontaneously separate into  a hot side and a cold side, with no help from Maxwells demon
This would  clearly violate the second law of thermodynamics, but it would not violate any  of the laws of mechanics or of probability
In principle it could happen, but  again, dont bet on it
Given the enormous number of particles involved (as  Loschmidt himself had been among the fi rst to show, a single cubic centimeter  of air contains about 1019 molecules), the likelihood of such a spontaneous sep- aration actually occurring is, as Boltzmann showed, vanishingly small
In an 1877 response to Loschmidt, Boltzmann explicitly cast his argument  in terms of molecular order and chaos
We can, he said, treat the problem  simply as one of parceling out a large number of particles over an array of   possible energy states
This was the key step toward formulating what became  known as statistical mechanics, and it had the great advantage of freeing Boltz- manns results from any dependence on the unknown details of how molecules  interact
By simply counting up the different ways the particles could be dis- tributed across the array of possible states, he could calculate the probability  that any particular case would occur
Consider again a deck of cards
Of the  8 � 1067 different sequences into which the 52 cards can fall, the overwhelming  majority will show no evident pattern or order
Since each individual sequence  is equally likely to occur, any particular shuffle is thus almost certain to pro- duce a sequence that appears completely jumbled
Similarly, the most probable  distribution of molecular speeds in a box of air is the one corresponding to the  largest number of distinct ways the total energy can be divided among the  particles
This, Boltzmann showed, is simply the familiar Maxwell-Boltzmann  distribution
Moreover, he showed, the entropy of any given state of the system  is proportional to the number of different ways the energy can be parceled out  to produce that state (or more precisely, to the logarithm of that number)
Expressed mathematically, S � k • logW, where S is the entropy, W is the prob- ability of the corresponding distribution, and k is what is now known as Boltz- manns constant
With its striking connection between entropy and probabil- ity, this formula encapsulated Boltzmanns greatest contribution to physics
Appropriately, it now stands inscribed on his tomb in (1)(2)
With his entropy formula, Boltzmann had seemingly nailed down a proof  that the second law of thermodynamics is ultimately statistical rather than  absolute
His struggles were not over, however
In the 1880s and 1890s several  chemists and physicists, led by Wilhelm Ostwald (1853–1932) and Ernst Mach  (1838–1916), objected that Boltzmann had demoted the second law to a sec- ond-class status
The second law states that, left to itself, heat always fl ows  from hot to cold and entropy always tends to increase
Now Boltzmann was  claiming, on the basis of an admittedly hypothetical theory about unseen mol- ecules, that heat might occasionally fl ow from cold to hot and entropy might  sometimes spontaneously decrease
The second law had been empirically con- fi rmed innumerable times; in a sense, it was reconfi rmed every time a steam  engine did its work
Boltzmanns supposed violations of the law, by contrast,  had never once been observed
(In fairness, Boltzmanns critics had to admit  that on his theory, such viola tions would be so unlikely that one would not  expect ever to observe them—though this raised the question of what weight  one should give to such a seemingly vacuous prediction
) If the kinetic theory  confl icted with the absolute and universal validity of the second law, Ostwald  and Mach said, so much the worse for the kinetic theory and the whole un - derlying claim that the world is made up of discrete atoms
Boltzmanns en-    tire theoretical structure was, they said, nothing more than a house of cards  founded on empty speculations
Boltzmann found these criticisms exasperating and beside the point
He  had answers for most of the objections raised against kinetic theory, but as the  years wore on he felt increasingly embattled
The fi rst volume of his Lectures  on Gas Theory appeared in 1896; by the time the second volume was ready two  years later, the attacks had, he said, greatly increased, and he saw himself as  “only an individual struggling weakly against the stream of time
” Nonethe- less, he resolved to lay out his theory as clearly and fully as he could, so that  when in some future era “the theory of gases is again revived, not too much  will have to be rediscovered
”⁷ Boltzmann no doubt took the attacks on kinetic  theory too much to heart; its opponents were never all that numerous, though  Mach and Ostwald were for a time infl uential in Austria and (1)(2) What  role, if any, the fi ght over kinetic theory and the reality of atoms played in 7

precipitating Boltzmanns fatal depression is still debated
The irony is that by  the time of his death in 1906, fi nal victory was already in view: statistical me - chanics had begun to score a series of triumphs, experimental evidence in favor  of kinetic theory was accumulating rapidly, and the case for believing in the  reality of atoms was becoming unassailable
The chief advance in statistical mechanics came from an unexpected quar- ter
(1) Willard Gibbs (1839–1903) was a professor at Yale; trained initially as an  engineer, he had long been the most notable, and almost the only, theoretical  physicist in (1)(2) He was best known for his work in pure thermodynam- ics, particularly a long paper, “On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Sub- stances” (1876–78), in which he had shown how the laws of energy and entropy  could be applied to a wide range of processes involving chemical reactions and  phase changes
Gibbs wrote in an austere style, eschewing speculative hypoth- eses and founding his reasoning as much as possible on ascertainable facts
This gave his work great power and generality, and his writings later provided  much of the theoretical foundation for the emerging fi eld of physical chemis- try as well as for many branches of chemical engineering
Gibbss approach  differed widely from Maxwell and Boltzmanns frequent reliance on hypotheti- cal mechanisms, and it is not surprising that Ostwald, who translated Gibbss  writings into German, cited him as an opponent of attempts to reduce ther- modynamics to a theory of molecular motions
By the 1890s, however, Gibbs  was already hard at work doing just that
His landmark Elementary Principles  in Statistical Mechanics appeared in 1902
Gibbss book was “elementary” only in the sense of being fundamental; it  was anything but easy reading
Building on Boltzmanns work, Gibbs focused  on the statistics of what he called “ensembles,” enormous collections of me - chanical systems that differ only in the positions and velocities of their com- ponent particles
He then worked out the relative probabilities of different  confi gurations within an ensemble and showed how such confi gurations and  their probabilities could be correlated with temperature, entropy, and other  macroscopic properties
Gibbss derivation of the entropy law was more gen- eral and less open to objection on mathematical grounds than Boltzmanns had  been, and his methods gradually came to be recognized as defi nitive
In 1905 Albert Einstein (1879–1955), then an obscure young patent exam- iner in Switzerland, worked out his own form of statistical mechanics and used  it to explain the “Brownian motion” seen when pollen grains and other small  particles immersed in liquids are viewed under a microscope
Einstein showed  that this jittery motion results from random fl uctuations in the number of  mole cules striking different sides of the particles; it is, in a sense, molecular chaos made visible
Einsteins theory led to quantitative predictions that the  French experimentalist Jean Perrin (1870–1942) was soon able to confi rm with  great precision
Coming on top of evidence from the study of radioactivity and  related phenomena, Perrins measurements clinched the case for the real exis- tence of atoms
Although the obstinate Ernst Mach went to his grave still de - claring atoms to be no more than convenient fi ctions, by 1910 Ostwald and  most of Boltzmanns other old opponents had accepted both the reality of  atoms and the validity of the kinetic theory
Heat, they belatedly agreed, really  was just the invisible motion of molecules
The second law of thermodynamics started as a rule governing the opera- tion of steam engines and other machines that harnessed “the motive power of  fi re
” From Carnot, it passed to Clausius and Thomson, who turned it into a  general law about the fl ow of heat and the limitations on its conversion into  work
Maxwell and Boltzmann then transformed this universal law of nature  into a theorem in molecular probability, having the same sort of truth as the  statement that you will never be able to fl ip “heads” a million times in a row
The development of kinetic theory was not driven by overtly technological  concerns; no one tried to fi nd the mean free path of a molecule or the shape  of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in an effort to improve the efficiency of steam engines or develop new industrial processes, though insights drawn  from kinetic theory in fact later led to new methods for liquefying gases and  separating chemical substances
The driving force behind the development of  kinetic theory was simply the desire to understand physical phenomena and  explain them in the simplest possible mechanical terms
Once set upon this  task, Clausius, Maxwell, Boltzmann, and other scientists were relentless in its  pursuit
That heat and the second law became the focus of scientists interest  at all in the nineteenth century refl ects, however, the broad technological con- text that had generated both the scientifi c problem and the means to solve it
Currents and Networks Today, most of us are surrounded by and dependent on a whole array of elec- trical technologies: lights, air conditioners, telephones, elevators, computers,  and the list goes on
A major power blackout is big news; the failure of our  electrical communica tions networks would be even bigger news—if anyone  still had a way to get the word out
The growth of these technologies, and of  peoples dependence on them, dates from the middle decades of the nineteenth  century; before about 1830, almost the only electri cal devices on the market  were lightning rods, a few medical implements, and various scientifi c toys and  instruments
The development of electrical technologies, fi rst for communi- cations and later for power and light, was closely tied to the rise of electrical  science, culminating in the formulation of Maxwellian fi eld theory and the  discovery of the electron
This was not a simple story of scientifi c discoveries leading to technologi- cal applications, however, nor did it exactly parallel the case of the steam engine  and thermo dynamics, in which the development of a new technology clearly  preceded and stimulated the creation of a new branch of science
The links  between electrical science and technology ran both ways in the nineteenth  century; each fed off the other
The fi rst electrical technology to have a broad  social and economic impact was the telegraph, which fi rst appeared in the late  1830s
Its origins were closely tied to earlier scientifi c discoveries; just as impor- tantly, the subsequent development of electrical science was deeply shaped by  the demands and opportunities presented by the growing web of telegraph  wires and cables
New Currents Before the nineteenth century, electricity was a science of sparks and shocks
Most early electrical experiments were intended to display this mysterious  power of nature in the most spectacular fashion possible or to bring out the  strange subtleties of its action
It had been known since ancient times that a  piece of amber, when rubbed, will attract bits of chaff; our word electric, in fact, comes from the Greek for “amber,” elektron
In the eighteenth century,  experimenters found they could produce great quantities of electricity by rub- bing a glass globe or plate and could convey its effects to a distance along damp  threads, wires, or other conductors
They also found they could store a sub- stantial charge of electricity in a “Leyden jar,” a simple glass jar partially cov- ered inside and out with metal foil and fi tted with a conducting rod running  down to its inner surface
By connecting the rod to a frictional generator, an  experimenter could, in effect, “pour” electricity into the jar; since the electric- ity could not pass through the glass, a charge built up on the inner metallic  surface, while an equal and opposite charge accumulated on the outer surface
When the two surfaces were connected through a wire or other conductor—a  human hand did nicely—the opposing charges abruptly recombined, produc- ing a crackling jolt that, with a large jar, could be strong enough to knock a  person down
Aside from such transient fl ows, eighteenth-century experimenters dealt  with electricity only in its static form; they studied charges, not currents
They  had long known that opposite charges attract each other, while like charges  repel, but the exact law governing electrical forces remained unclear until the  French engineer Charles Coulomb tackled the problem in 1785
As we saw in  Chapter 1, Coulomb used a delicate torsion balance to show that the force one  electric charge exerts on another falls off with the square of the distance be - tween them, just as the attraction between masses does in Newtons law of  gravitation
Coulomb used a similar apparatus to show that the force between  magnetic poles also follows an inverse square law, but he did not believe this  indicated any real connection between electricity and magnetism; they were,  he said, wholly separate subtle fl uids that simply happened to obey the same  force law
Coulombs results fi t well with the rising Laplacian program, which sought  to reduce all physical phenomena to forces of attraction and repulsion acting  between invisibly small particles
On this view, the scientifi c study of electric- ity was simply a matter of measuring the attraction or repulsion between  charged bodies and then working out, in a mathematically rigorous way, the  underlying law of force
As the eighteenth century drew to a close, electricity  appeared to be settling in as a fairly well understood, though hardly central,  branch of physics
In fact, discoveries made in Italy were about to take electrical science in  new and surprising directions
In 1791 Luigi Galvani (1737–98), a medical pro- fessor in Bologna, published an account of observations he had made while  dissecting frogs
He had noticed that when he touched a scalpel to an exposed nerve in a dead frogs leg while an electrical machine was sparking nearby, the  attached muscle suddenly contracted, making the leg kick
Frog legs turned  out to be exquisitely sensitive electrical detectors, and Galvani soon found he  could make one twitch without using a spark at all, simply by running a brass  hook through the nerve tissue and then touching both it and the attached  muscle with a piece of iron wire
He concluded that the nerves of living things,  and even recently dead ones, contain “animal electricity” that can be dis- charged, just like the electricity in a Leyden jar, by a properly placed conduct- ing wire
Alessandro Volta (1745–1827), a physics professor at Pavia, took up Gal- vanis discovery but denied it had anything to do with “animal electricity”; the  frogs leg was no more than a detector, Volta said, and the electrical force that  made it kick arose simply from the contact of dissimilar metals, such as the  brass hooks and iron wires Galvani had used to form his circuits
In 1800 Volta  showed that he could produce sparks and other electrical effects from a simple  stack of copper and zinc discs interleaved with bits of dampened pasteboard,  without using frog legs or any other animal parts
Voltas electrical “pile,” or  battery, seemed to act like a small Leyden jar that was somehow able continu- ally to recharge itself
It provided experimenters for the fi rst time with a con- tinuous source of electric current and so opened a vast new realm for scientifi c  research and technological use
Much of the subsequent history of electrical  science and technology can be read as a series of attempts to come to grips  with the puzzles and possibilities presented by currents like those from Voltas   battery
Initially, most researchers focused on the battery itself, piling up evidence  that it was not driven by the simple contact of dissimilar metals, as Volta had  argued, but by chemical reactions in the moistened pasteboard
The current  in the conducting wire did not attract much attention until 1820, when the   Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851) made a surprising dis- covery
Infl uenced by German Naturphilosophie, Oersted believed that all  physical forces share an underlying unity
Rejecting the view that electric and  magnetic forces are entirely separate, he also questioned the usual assumption  that the current from a voltaic battery is a simple fl ow of electric fl uid, pictur- ing it instead as a complex “electric confl ict” involving the continual separa- tion and recombination of positive and negative electricities within the wire
Oersted thought this electric confl ict might also produce magnetic forces, but  his efforts to demonstrate such an effect all ended in failure
Finally, while delivering a lecture early in 1820, Oersted tried a deceptively  simple experiment
Connecting a wire across the poles of a battery, he held it lengthwise above a magnetized compass needle—and watched as the needle  swung until it pointed across the wire
When he held the wire below it, the  needle swung to point in the opposite direction
The electric confl ict was evi- dently not confi ned to the conducting wire, Oersted said, but set up a swirling  vortex in the surrounding space that made the magnetized needle point like a  weather vane in the wind
Most other physicists dismissed Oersteds theories as muddled and mis- taken, but they were quick to take up his experimental discovery
In Germany,  (1) (1) (1) Schweigger found he could strengthen the effect by suspending the  magnetized needle within an upright coil of several turns of wire, producing  a “galvanometer” that quickly became the most widely used detector of elec- tric currents
In England, William Sturgeon wrapped a current-carrying wire  around a horseshoe made of soft iron, producing an electromagnet more pow- erful than any natural magnet, while Michael Faraday showed in 1821 that a  wire carrying a current can be made to rotate continuously around a magnetic  pole
In France, the Laplacian physicists (1)  (1) Biot and Felix Savart used tech- niques much like Coulombs to measure the force that currents exert on mag- netic poles and went on to formulate the mathematical law governing such  forces
The fi rst comprehensive theory of electromagnetic forces was worked out  in the early 1820s by André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836), an eccentric, largely  self-taught French mathematician
Although he had previously paid little at - tention to electricity and magnetism, word of Oersteds discovery set him off Oersteds Magnetic Needle  Deflected by an Electric Current In 1820, the Danish physicist (1) (1) Oer- sted discovered that when he placed a   magnetized needle near a wire carrying an  electric current, the needle turned to point  at right angles to the direction of the cur- rent
The effect was not a simple attraction  or repulsion but appeared to show that  electric currents somehow exerted a more  complex directive force on magnets
Earlier  physicists had often noted parallels be - tween electrical and magnetic phenomena,  but Oersted was the fi rst to demonstrate that electric currents could act directly on  magnetized objects

on a fl urry of experimentation and theorizing
Within days, Ampère had dem- onstrated that wires carrying electric currents fl owing in parallel directions  attract each other, while those carrying currents fl owing in opposite directions  repel
He also showed that a current-carrying coil behaves much like a bar  magnet, aligning itself with the earths poles and attracting or repelling other  nearby coils or magnets
Ampère went on to suggest that all permanent mag- nets are really electromagnets, composed not of Coulombs imaginary mag- netic fl uids but of tiny molecular rings of electric current that, when aligned,  combine to exert magnetic forces
Ampère was never a member of the Laplacian circle; a friend of (1)-(1) Fres- nel and François Arago, he instead supported their anti-Laplacian insurgency
Fresnels work on the wave theory of light had convinced Ampère that space is  fi lled with an elastic ether, and he believed that electromagnetic forces would  ultimately be found to result from the invisible motions of this ether
In his  mathematical work, however, Ampère generally followed the Laplacians prac- tice of formulating force laws that were independent of any speculative hypoth- eses, and in a series of papers published in the early 1820s he showed how  known electromagnetic phenomena could be explained by forces of attraction  and repulsion acting between short segments of electric current
By 1826 Am - père had cast the mathematical theory of the forces between steady currents  into essentially the form it has retained ever since
Ampères characteristic way of working was to propose a law of force, de - vise a piece of apparatus with which to test some aspect of it, and have the  apparatus built by a skilled instrument maker
(Ampère was reportedly too  clumsy to build or operate anything himself
) He often used a “null” method  in which the force in question would be exactly balanced by a contrary one, so  that when the current was switched on and the experiment began, nothing  actually moved
This gave his arguments an aura of great precision and rigor,  since he did not need to rely on difficult and uncertain measurements of the  strength of small forces, but it tied his experimental results very closely to his  specifi c theories and left little room for novel discoveries to turn up in the  laboratory
Ampère in fact later confessed that he never performed some of the  experi ments described in his papers, though he argued with some justice that  the results of other experiments made it clear how these imaginary ones would  have turned out
James Clerk Maxwell once called Ampère “the Newton of electricity,” and  in the sense that he reduced a mass of complicated phenomena to a few simple  laws of force, Ampère certainly deserved the title
His work left important  questions unanswered, however, particularly about the way currents might be - have when they were changing rather than steady, and his methods gave little  guidance as to how one might address such questions
As it turned out, the  next great steps in the study of electromagnetism came along lines very differ- ent from Ampères formulation of laws of force between currents, and were  taken by a man, Michael Faraday, to whom the mathematics behind such laws  remained a closed book
Faradays Lines of Force Michael Faraday (1791–1867) was among the most admired scientists of his  day
Celebrated during his lifetime as a great experimental discoverer, an elo- quent public lecturer, and a fi gure of unimpeachable personal integrity, he was  later lauded for originating the concept of the electromagnetic fi eld, now  regarded as one of the great theoretical advances of the nineteenth century
It  took Faraday many years to draw together the threads that would eventually  form his fi eld theory, and other scientists even longer to accept his contention  that we should look to the surrounding space, rather than to charges, currents,  and magnets themselves, for the real key to electromagnetic phenomena
Fara- day kept himself aloof from commercial pursuits, but he had a strong interest  in technology and was happy to see many of his experimental discoveries and  theoretical ideas taken up in connection with telegraphy and other electrical  technologies
The son of a London blacksmith, Faraday worked his way up from ex - tremely modest beginnings
His family were members of what he later called  “a very small and despised sect of Christians known, if known at all, as San- demanians,” and his devotion to this simple but demanding faith deeply  shaped his life and thought
¹ In particular, the character istic Sandemanian  emphasis on the unadorned word of God led Faraday to try to grasp and ex - press the workings of the physical world in the most direct way possible, with- out recourse to elaborate mathematical theories
He received only the most  basic schooling, and at age fourteen, after working for a time as an er  rand boy,  he was apprenticed to a bookbinder
As he read the books that passed through  his hands, Faraday developed a passion for science and for self-improvement  and soon began a single-minded effort to educate himself and make his way in  the scientifi c world
In 1812, Faraday chanced to attend a series of lectures on chemistry at the  Royal Institution, a privately endowed scientifi c center in (1)(2) The lec- 1
Michael Faraday to Augusta Ada Lovelace, 24 Oct(1), in (1) (1) (1) (1) James, ed, Corre- spondence of Michael Faraday (London: IEE/IET, 1991–), 3:266
tures were delivered by Sir Humphry Davy (1778–1829), the leading British  chemist of the day, and in hopes of making an impression, Faraday wrote out  an elaborate set of notes, bound them, and presented them to (1)(2) The gam- bit paid off: Davy soon helped Faraday land a job as a laboratory assistant at  the Royal Institution and in 1813 brought him along as his personal assistant  on extended tour of continental (1)(2) A special invitation from Napoleon  enabled Davy and his party to travel freely even though France and Britain  were still at war
Faraday had never before been more than a few miles from  his London home, and the trip broadened his horizons enormously
It also  strengthened his aspirations to become a scientist himself, and he chafed as Sir  Humphry and Lady Davy often treated him as little more than their servant
On returning to London in 1815, Faraday took up a permanent post at the  Royal (1)(2) He moved into rooms in the building, and it would remain  his home until his retirement nearly 50 years later
The Royal Institution had  been founded in 1799 by Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford) and a group  of wealthy Englishmen to promote economic improvement through scientifi c  research and education
Davy, a dashing fi gure who counted William Words- worth and other Romantic poets among his circle of friends, was hired as the  professor of chemistry
He soon turned the institution into a venue for fash- ionable lectures at which the cream of London society was shown the latest  scientifi c wonders
Faraday assisted Davy in his chemical researches and had  charge of the apparatus in the institution laboratory
He also strove to make  his own mark in science, notably with his 1821 discovery of electromagnetic  rotation, but Davy seems to have resented Faradays rise from subordinate to  potential rival
Although Faradays reputation as a researcher and public lec- turer grew steadily through the 1820s, he did not fully emerge into his own  until after Davys death in 1829
In August 1831, Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction
Oersted had  shown that electric currents produce magnetic forces; now Faraday, after many  attempts, found a way to make magnetic forces produce electric currents
The  discovery, made in the basement laboratory of the Royal Institution, exempli- fi ed Faradays skill at coaxing new phenomena from simple apparatus
He be - gan by winding two coils of insulated wire around an iron ring
A steady bat- tery current in the fi rst coil had no effect on the second, but when Faraday  threw a switch and suddenly started or stopped the current in the fi rst coil, the  needle of a galvanometer connected to the second coil jumped
No current  actually passed between the coils, but the change in the current fl owing in the  fi rst coil somehow induced a momentary surge of current in the second one
Faraday soon showed that the effect was essentially magnetic: the current fl owing in the fi rst coil turned the iron ring into an electromagnet, and when  the current was started or stopped, the resulting change in the magnetism of  the ring produced a fl eeting current in the second coil
The ring and coils  formed a primitive transformer, a device that would later play a crucial role in  alternating current power systems
Faraday found that he could also induce a  current by plunging a bar magnet into a coil of wire; as the magnet entered the  coil, it generated a brief pulse of current, and then a second in the opposite  direction when it was pulled out
Within a few months after Faraday announced his discovery, instrument  makers were putting spinning coils and magnets together to build the fi rst  magneto-electric generators
One could now produce an electric current by  simply turning a crank, without using a battery at all
Inventors also devised  arrangements of electromagnets that, when fed with a current, turned round  and round—the fi rst electric motors
By turning the crank of one of the new  magneto generators, an experimenter could turn mechanical work into elec- trical energy, convey it along a wire, and then use it to drive a distant motor,  where the electrical energy would reappear as mechanical work
These early  combinations of magnetos and motors were balky and inefficient, and it would  be several decades before Thomas Edison and others would build the fi rst  practical electrical power systems, but Faradays discoveries helped lay the foun- dations while also bringing out important points about the conservation and  transformation of energy
Most other physicists would have tried to explain electromagnetic induc- tion mathematically by forces acting between electrical particles or segments  of current; indeed, the German physicists Wilhelm Weber (1804–91) and Franz  Neumann (1798–1895) later did just that, with considerable success
Faraday,  however, was no mathematician, and at a time when Ampère and others were  applying sophisticated mathematical methods to electromagnetic phenomena,  Faradays papers lacked even the simplest equations
This was no doubt chiefl y  because his own aptitude and training lay in chemistry rather than mathe- matics, but it also refl ected a principled objection, perhaps deriving from his  literalist religious views, to dressing the direct truths of the laboratory in what  he regarded as the artifi cial costume of mathematical symbols
Faraday sought  in  stead to depict electric and magnetic phenomena in visual and physical  terms, particularly through what he called “lines of force
” If we sprinkle iron fi lings around a bar magnet, they arrange themselves  into beautiful patterns of curving lines, converging on the magnetic poles and  spreading out through the intervening space
Most mathematically trained  physicists, and certainly those who followed Coulomb and the Laplacians, looked on such lines as simply the geometrical result of the forces the poles of  the magnet exerted on the tiny bits of iron
They believed these forces acted  directly at a distance and saw no reason to think that, absent the fi lings, any- thing signifi cant was going on in the space around a magnet
Faraday, in con- trast, looked on this space not as an inert void but as a site teeming with  activity; the sprinkled fi lings did not create the lines of force, he said, but sim- ply revealed tensions that were already there
As he studied the patterns made  by iron fi lings, Faraday came to picture each line of force as an “axis of power”  running between the opposing poles and straining, like a stretched rubber  band, to draw them together
Every part of the surrounding medium was po - larized, he said, and magnetic forces did not act directly across space but by  “contiguous action” from one particle of the medium to the next
According to Faraday, electromagnetic induction results from the cutting  of lines of force
Each time a line of magnetic force cuts a wire, he said, it gives  the wire a kick of electromotive force, producing an impulse of current
When  the coil and magnet are both motionless and the magnetic force is steady, no  lines are cut and there is thus no kick and no current
If, however, the coil  moves past the magnet or the magnet past the coil, or if the lines of magnetic  force either grow or shrink (as when an electromagnet is switched on or off), the magnetic lines will cut the turns of the coil and thus generate a current in  the wire
Faraday could not yet say exactly how or why this cutting produced  an electric current, but the image of moving lines of force gave him a vivid and  almost tactile feel for the process
In his notebooks, Faraday began to sketch a three-way relationship linking  electric current, magnetism, and motion
Oersted had shown that an electric  current can move a magnetized needle, and Faraday himself had shown in 1821 that a magnet can move a wire that is carrying an electric current
With his  discovery of electromagnetic induction, Faraday completed the cycle by show- ing that a magnet moving near a coil of wire can produce an electric current
This was a great unifi cation, but it raised subtle issues about the relationship  between force and motion, and about the real meaning of motion itself, that  were to lurk in the background of electrical theory for the rest of the century
Many of these questions were not fully resolved until the advent of relativity  theory; it was no accident that Albert Einstein opened his famous 1905 paper  “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies” with an analysis of Faradays clas- sic experiment with a moving magnet and a coil of wire
Infl uenced more by chemical ideas about powers and polarities than by the  orthodox Newtonian concept of forces acting directly at a distance, Faraday  began to question the usual view that electricity consists of positive and nega- tive particles whose motion constitutes an electric current
He focused instead  on the lines of electric force that, on analogy to magnetic lines, he pictured  spreading out from electrifi ed bodies and running through the surrounding  insulating medium, or “dielectric,” such as air or glass
Faraday regarded these  lines of force as the true foundation of all electrical phenomena; charges, he  said, are quite secondary, merely superfi cial effects that arise when a line of  force passes from an insulator (such as glass or air) that is able to sustain electri- cal tension into a conductor (such as copper) in which it breaks down
Thus,  rather than seeing a Leyden jar as a bottle fi lled with electric fl uid, he saw it as  a bundle of powerful electrical tensions that were located, not in the inner and  outer metal coatings, but within the insulating dielectric—in this case, glass— that separated them
Faradays reconceptuali za tion of the function of wires was similarly radical,  for he pictured an electric current not as the fl ow of a fl uid but as the continual  breaking down of tension within a conducting wire
When a battery is hooked  up in a circuit, he said, it quickly sets up a state of electrical strain within the  connecting wire and throughout the space around it
The metal of the wire is  unable to sustain this strain, which immediately begins to break down, leaving Faradays Lines of Force  around a Magnet If we sprinkle iron fi lings around a bar  magnet, they spontaneously arrange them- selves into curving patterns like the one  shown here
To Michael Faraday, such  “lines of force” were not just a pretty curi- osity but the key to a fundamental truth of  nature
The space around a magnet is not an inert void, he said, but is instead fi lled  with the force and activity revealed by the  sprinkled fi lings
Faradays conception of  lines of force held the seeds of what would  become the fi eld theory of electromagne- tism
� Michael Faraday, Experimental  Researches in Electricity, vol(1) (London:  Quaritch, 1855), plate IV, fi g(1)
a charge on its surface and a “current” of continually decaying strain that keeps  churning along inside the wire as long as the battery continues to supply fresh  electric force
In 1837, Faradays rethinking of the nature of charge and current led him  to perform a series of experiments that culminated in his discovery of specifi c  inductive capacity
If the glass within a Leyden jar is the real seat of electric  tensions, Faraday reasoned, then if we were to use a different insulating dielec- tric, the jar ought to store a different amount of charge
He proceeded to build  a special Leyden jar from which he could, in effect, remove the glass and re - place it with pieces of shellac, sulfur, or other insulators
Holding the tension  (in later terms, the voltage) between the inner and outer metal surfaces of the  jar constant, he found that the total charge stored by the jar changed by a  measurable amount as he inserted each new substance
While this did not prove  all of Faradays ideas about the nature of charge and current to be correct, it  clearly showed that the dielectric was not just an inert separator but instead  played an active part in electrical phenomena
By the late 1830s, Faraday felt he was on the verge of a major breakthrough  in understanding electromagnetism, but he had trouble pulling it all together
He pictured lines of force hopping from molecule to molecule through the  dielectric, but while this worked well enough for material media such as glass  or air, it failed for the vacuum, where he had to fall back on the old picture of  electric and magnetic forces acting directly at a distance
Nor did magnetism  seem to be universal in the same way electrical forces were; although he could  produce either electrical polariza tion or conduction, or both, in any substance,  iron and nickel (and, as he later showed, cobalt) were the only materials that  showed any signs of being magnetic
Faradays efforts to push further were  stymied, and at the end of 1839 he was brought to a dead stop by ill health
He  was troubled by headaches and vertigo; his memory, never strong, worsened to  the point that he often lost his train of thought
Whether brought on by over- work, mercury poisoning, or a minor stroke, these problems left Faraday un - able to do much scientifi c work for several years
His memory remained poor  for the rest of his life, but by about 1843 his health had recovered enough for  him to return to the laboratory
Over the next 10 years he made important new  experimental discoveries and also took the fi nal steps toward framing the fi eld  theory that had been just beyond his reach in the 1830s
Other scientists of the day respected Faradays skill as an experimenter and  public lecturer, but most dismissed his theoretical ideas as confused and child- ish
Several patronizingly said that while Faradays ideas about lines of force  seemed to help him think up useful experiments, they were really no more than a mental crutch suited to someone who could not handle a proper mathemat- ical theory
As late as 1855, (1)  (1) Airy, the head of the Greenwich Observatory  and himself both a distinguished mathemati cal physicist and Faradays good  friend, declared that Coulombs inverse square law gave a complete mathemat- ical account of magnetic forces, and said no one who really understood the  situation would “hesitate an instant in the choice between this simple and  precise action, on the one hand, and anything so vague and varying as lines of  force, on the other hand
”² By then, however, a few cracks were opening up in  the wall of indifference to Faradays theories
As we will see in the next chapter,  William Thomson and James Clerk Maxwell had begun to cast Faradays fi eld  ideas into mathematical form, with consequences that were to transform elec- tromagnetic theory
Just as importantly, Faradays ideas about induction and  conduction were being taken up and given wide circulation in connection with  a revolutionary new technology: telegraphy
Lightning Wires Once scientists had established that an electric current can pass along a sub- stantial length of wire and defl ect a needle or trip a lever at the far end, it did  not take long for inventors and entrepreneurs to fi nd ways to use batteries,  wires, and magnets to convey telegraphic signals
By the mid-1840s several  workable telegraph systems were in use and networks of wires were spreading  rapidly across Europe and America, with wide-ranging effects on the dissemi- nation of news and the workings of commercial markets
With time, science  too was affected, as the growing telegraph industry created both a new demand  for electrical knowledge and new opportunities for acquiring it
Before the introduction of the electric telegraph, a message could generally  travel no faster than the messenger who carried it
Almost the only exceptions  were the small number of dispatches that passed along the networks of optical  telegraphs erected in France and a few other countries after 1793
The French  system, devised by Claude Chappe and adopted by the revolutionary govern- ment as a wartime measure, consisted of a chain of towers erected on hilltops  a few miles apart, each topped by a crossbar with two swiveling arms
An  operator set the arms to indicate the signs of a code; his counterpart at the next  station watched through a telescope, noted down the signs, and set the arms  of his own apparatus to relay the message along its way
Repeated from station  to station, this process could pass a message hundreds of miles in less than an 2

In the 1790s the British Admiralty built its own chain of optical tele- graphs from London to the naval base at Portsmouth, and similar systems were  erected elsewhere
Although they provided a valuable service, optical tele- graphs were expensive to maintain and failed in darkness or fog
They are now  nearly forgotten, a few scattered spots bearing the name “Telegraph Hill”  standing as almost the only reminders that they ever existed
That electricity might be used to transmit messages was fi rst suggested in  the 1750s
The earliest proposals called for using frictionally generated static  electricity to produce sparks or repel pith balls at the far end of a wire
This  worked over distances up to a few miles, but frictional electricity was produced  at such high tension that it was hard to keep the wires adequately insulated
The best of the electrostatic systems was one built in 1816 by a young English- man, Francis Ronalds (1788–1873), which he demonstrated working through  eight miles of wire
When Ronalds tried to interest the Admiralty in his sys- tem, however, they told him they were happy with their optical telegraph, and  he soon gave up his efforts
After Volta and Oersteds discoveries, inventors turned from electrostatic  systems to ones that used currents to produce electromagnetic effects
In 1820 Ampère proposed a telegraph having separate wires and needles for each letter  of the alphabet, with words being spelled out by sending a current along the  wire corresponding to each letter
Ampère never built the device, but Pavel  Schilling, a Russian diplomat working in Munich, devised a similar system  that used several wires and a set of coded signals
Schilling later simplifi ed his  telegraph to work with a single wire and showed it widely in the early 1830s but was unable to bring it into practical use before his death in 1836
In Amer- ica, Joseph Henry (1797–1878) rigged an electromagnet to ring a bell with a  current that had passed through more than a mile of wire but went no further  than to demonstrate the feat to his classes at the Albany Academy in 1831
In - deed, except for a line the German physicist Wilhelm Weber and the mathe- matician (1)  (1) Gauss (1777–1855) strung up in 1833 to exchange signals between  their laboratory and observatory in Göttingen, none of the earliest electromag- netic telegraphs amounted to much more than lecture demonstrations
Early in 1836 (1) (1) Cooke (1806–1879), a young Englishman who had been  studying in Germany, saw a demonstration of Schillings telegraph and decided  to make it his ticket to wealth and fame
He quickly patched together a tele- graph of his own based on the gearing of a music box, the only kind of mech- anism he knew much about, but his knowledge of electromagnetism was so  meager he could barely get it to work across a room, much less across the hun- dreds of miles he envisioned
On returning to London, he sought out Faraday, who told him the basic principle of his telegraph was sound but ex  pressed  doubts about its commercial prospects
In November 1836 Cooke turned to  Charles Wheatstone (1802–75), a young physics professor at Kings College  London who was studying the trans mission of electric currents
It turned out  Wheatstone had already been thinking about telegraphs himself, and the two  men soon decided to pool their efforts
Wheatstone came from a family of musical instrument makers, and his  fi rst scientifi c studies focused on how sound travels along stretched strings and  wooden rods
He then took up electricity and in 1834 used a clever rotating  mirror device to show that electric currents run along wires at about the speed  of light
He also began to work out ideas for an electric telegraph, though more  as a scientifi c puzzle than a commercial enterprise
When Cooke came to him,  Wheatstone saw an opportunity to combine his own scientifi c expertise with  Cookes entrepreneurial drive, but while the two men became partners, they  continued to circle each other warily, each eager not only to make the tele- graph a practical success but also to secure as much credit and reward as pos- sible for himself
Rejecting Cookes music box device as unworkable, Wheatstone drew on  his knowledge of currents and magnetism to devise an improved needle tele- graph
He and Cooke fi led for a patent in June 1837 and installed their fi rst  short line at a London railway station a month later
They laid a more perma- nent 13-mile line along a railway west of London in 1839, running the cotton- covered wires through iron tubes buried beside the tracks
Their fi rst telegraphs  had six wires and fi ve needles, but they soon found that by using a simple code,  they could send messages just as readily with only two needles, or even one
They also gave up burying their wires in the ground, fi nding it cheaper and  easier to string them from overhead poles
At fi rst Cooke and Wheatstones  system was used mainly for simple railway signaling, but after the new Electric  Telegraph Company acquired their patent rights in 1845, more lines were built  for public use
Wheatstones work on the telegraph fed back into his scientifi c research,  notably in a paper on methods of electrical measurement that he presented to  the Royal Society in 1843
Although he devised these methods to help improve  telegraphic signaling, he noted that they were “not limited to this especial ob - ject” and would prove useful “in all inquiries relating to the laws of electric  currents
”³ Most of the paper focused on Ohms law, which had attracted 3

little attention when fi rst published in 1827
(1) (1) Ohm (1789–1854) was a  German mathematics teacher who had shown that the current in an electric  circuit is proportional to the electromotive force (voltage) divided by the resis- tance of the conductor, expressed algebraically as I � V/(1) Wheatstone read  Ohms paper, recognized its value, and arranged to have it published in English  translation in 1841
In his own paper, Wheatstone described a clever way to  measure re  sistances by balancing them against each other; although he made  clear that the method was based on an arrangement devised a few years before  by (1) (1) Chris tie, it has been known ever since as the “Wheatstone bridge
”  Wheatstones techniques later came to be widely used by both physicists and  electrical engineers, but at fi rst few telegraphers saw much need for such accu- rate electrical measurements
If a usable current got through, that was enough  for them, and many were content to use their fi ngers or tongues to detect it
Effective demand for precision electrical measurements, or even for standard  units of current and resistance, did not emerge until the late 1850s, largely in  connection with the new technology of submarine cable telegraphy
In the United States, the electric telegraph is usually credited to Sam- uel (1) (1) Morse (1791–1872), though he is perhaps more accurately seen as its  promoter than as its inventor
Romantic images of the lone genius notwith- standing, it would be a mistake to ascribe the invention of the telegraph to a  single person; like many technologies, it was the product of the combined  efforts of many hands and minds
A talented painter who became the fi rst  professor of art at New York University, Morse knew little about electricity  until, on a voyage home from Europe in 1832, a fellow passenger told him  about recent discoveries in electromagnetism
It struck Morse that if a pulse of  current could make itself felt instantaneously across a room, it might be made  to do so across a continent and so provide a way to send messages to any dis- tance
Knowing almost nothing of what others had already done, he seems to  have imagined he was the fi rst ever to conceive of electrical signaling
Over the next few years Morse cobbled together a remarkably cumbersome  telegraph
Starting with a wooden frame originally used to stretch canvases, he  hung from it a wooden pendulum with a pencil on its end
When a pulse of  current entered from the connecting wire, an electromagnet mounted on the  frame pulled the pendulum to one side and then released it; as it swung, the  pencil marked a V on a paper tape that was pulled along by clockwork
Morse  read off the resulting series of marks as numbers and translated them into  words by referring to a special code book
To send a message, he would set a  row of metal teeth into a grooved stick and pull it along beneath an electrical contact to produce a coded sequence of pulses in the connecting wire
At fi rst  he could send signals no more than about 40 feet before the current became  too weak to work the electromagnet, but Leonard Gale, a chemistry professor  at New York University who was familiar with Henrys work, showed Morse  how to produce more intense currents by rearranging his batteries and wind- ing more turns of wire around his magnet
By September 1837, Morse could  send signals through about a thousand feet of wire
Lacking both the money and the mechanical skill to develop his device  further, Morse turned to a former student, Alfred Vail (1807–59)
Vails father  owned an ironworks in New Jersey and was willing to invest in the project;  moreover, Vail himself was a skilled mechanician
Seeing great potential in  electric telegraphy, he signed on as Morses junior partner and over the winter  of 1837–38 began to turn the clumsy canvas-stretcher device into the simple  and robust system later familiar as the “Morse telegraph
” In Vails hands, the  swinging pendulum gave way to a compact steel stylus that clicked up and  down to mark the moving paper tape
(Operators later stopped using the  tape after fi nding they could read messages by the clicking sound alone
)  According to some accounts, Vail even devised the famous “Morse code” of  dots and dashes to represent letters; in any case, this soon supplanted Morses  original system based on numbers and a code book
Vail also replaced Morses  cumbersome sending apparatus with a simple fi nger-key—later known as a  “Morse key”—with which operators could tap out messages directly
Under  the terms of their partnership agreement, however, all of Vails contributions,  and Gales as well, were folded into Morses patent
Morse initially fi led for the  patent in October 1837, and it was fi nally granted in 1840; from the fi rst, all  public credit went to Morse alone
Morse and Vail demonstrated their improved telegraph in New Jersey, New  York, and Washington, (1)C, early in 1838, and Morse showed it off on a Eu - ropean tour in 1838–39
Although the device attracted some favorable notice,  Morses application for an English patent was rejected on the grounds that the  invention was not really new
The whole project made little headway until  1843, when careful lobbying helped Morse win a congressional grant to build  an experimental line from Washington to (1)(2) The fi rst lengths of line  were insulated with cotton and laid underground in lead pipes, but shady  contracting and high costs soon brought the work to a halt
Shifting to the  cheaper expedient of stringing their wires from overhead poles, Morse and his  partners successfully completed the 40-mile line in May 1844
It soon drew  attention by carrying the fi rst reports of the presidential nominating conven- tions being held in Baltimore, but Congress decided not to extend the line  further, and thereafter the development of the telegraph in the United States  was left to private enterprise
Telegraph lines spread rapidly—perhaps too rapidly—in the United States  in the late 1840s
By 1850 dozens of competing companies had strung over  12,000 miles of wire, but many lines were so badly built that they barely worked
In some areas, companies did not even bother with poles, instead simply hang- ing their wires from brackets nailed to trees
Not surprisingly, both the quality  of service and the reputation of the new technology suffered badly
In other  countries, the telegraph advanced more slowly but somewhat more surely
By  1850 the Electric Telegraph Company had built over 2,000 miles of lines along  British railways, and government-owned lines soon went up in various parts of  continental Europe and British (1)(2) The American telegraph industry went  through a brutal shakeout in the late 1850s, and by 1866 the Western Union  Company had established a virtual monopoly throughout the country
In Brit- ain, the government bought out the private companies in 1868 and made the  telegraph network part of the postal system, as it had been from the fi rst in  most other countries
From its earliest days, telegraphy was the subject of expansive and utopian  rhetoric
The electric wires were often described as the “nervous system” of the  nation, binding it together and vivifying its parts; comparing its effects to  those of railways and steamships, innumerable editorial writers declared that  the telegraph had “annihilated time and space” and defeated the tyranny of  distance
The effects of the telegraph were felt fi rst and most strongly in the  commercial world, as the availability of up-to-date price information helped  consolidate fragmented local markets in grain, cotton, and other commodities
Commercial messages and market reports accounted for over two-thirds of the  traffic on American telegraph lines in the 1850s; and in the 1860s the glass- domed “stock ticker” became a familiar sight, spewing out minute-by-minute  price fl uctuations on seemingly endless streams of paper tape
The telegraph  also reshaped the news business
As early as 1846, six New York newspapers  joined together to pool the gathering of telegraphic news reports, thus launch- ing the Associated Press, the fi rst and still the largest of the “wire services
”  Newspapers began to carry same-day accounts of distant events, and though  early telegraphic bulletins were usually brief and fragmentary, news reporting  quickly acquired a reach and immediacy it had never before possessed
Telegraphs were also put to many other uses, including distributing ac - curate time signals, gathering weather information to track storms, and con- necting fi re alarm boxes in cities
Not all of the effects of the telegraph were positive, however
In the early days, the lines were so faulty and operators so  in  experienced that messages, if they arrived at all, were often garbled and use- less; when the lines were working, swindlers all too often used them to manip- ulate markets and cheat the unwary
In 1854, Henry David Thoreau declared  that the telegraph offered no more than “improved means to an unimproved  end,” a quicker way to convey what need not have been said at all
“We are in  great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas,” he noted,  “but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate
”⁴ More typical, however, were the sentiments that Edward Copleston, a Welsh  bishop, recorded in his diary after visiting Wheatstone in 1840
“Last night I  was hardly able to sleep,” he wrote, as he pondered the implications of the  telegraph
“Gas and steam have done much,” he said, but electricity “is des- tined to do much more, and to work an incalculable change in human affairs
It far exceeds even the feats of pretended magic, and the wildest fi ctions of the  (1)(2)”⁵ The Cable Empire The fi rst telegraph lines all ran overland, but as the web of wires spread, there  was a growing demand for lines that could cross rivers, seas, and even oceans
The fi rst successful submarine cable was laid across the English Channel in  1851; more soon followed, most famously the failed Atlantic cable of 1858 and  the two successful ones of 1866
By 1880, submarine cables stretched to almost  every corner of the globe and were rapidly transforming international com - munica tions
Signifi cantly, almost all of these cables were built, laid, and oper- ated by British fi rms
There is no great mystery why this should be so: Britan- nia ruled the waves in the nineteenth century, and it was only natural that she  should seek to extend that rule beneath the waves as well
As a maritime trad- ing nation and as easily the leading commercial, industrial, and imperial power  of the day, Britain had both the greatest need for submarine cables and the  greatest capacity for laying them
British dominance of the global cable indus- try had important consequences for science as well as for commerce
As British  physicists and engineers confronted the problems peculiar to building and  operating long submarine cables, their scientifi c work was led in distinctive  directions
Some of the leading features of British electrical science in the  Victorian period, including its emphasis on precision measurement and its  focus on the electromagnetic fi eld, had deep roots in cable telegraphy

Morse, Wheatstone, and others had experimented in the 1840s with under- water wires covered with tarred rope, but they soon realized that effective sub- marine telegraphy would require a better insulating material
One soon came  to hand in the form of gutta-percha, a rubber-like natural plastic de  rived from  the sap of Malayan gutta trees
Malayans had long used this pliable, waterproof  material to fashion whips, hats, and other objects; and soon after the fi rst  samples appeared in England in 1843, Faraday and others pointed out that  gutta-percha was a good electrical insulator and well suited to covering wires
In Germany, Werner von Siemens (1816–92) used it to insulate an underground  telegraph line laid from Berlin to Frankfurt in 1849, and similar under ground  lines were laid in Britain as well
Gutta-percha proved even more useful on  underwater lines, beginning with the 27-mile-long cable (1) (1) Brett and his  Submarine Telegraph Company laid across the English Channel in 1851
Bretts  cable earned handsome profi ts carrying market reports and other news between  London and Paris, and entrepreneurs looking to cash in soon set about laying  cables to Ireland, Holland, and across the (1)(2) Many of these early  attempts failed, and those that succeeded owed more to luck than to any real  understanding of the problems involved
Proponents of the new technology  were undaunted, however, and as they bent over their maps and globes, they  began to visualize cables spanning all the oceans of the world
The great prize, of course, would be the (1)(2) Even the fastest steam- ships in the 1850s took more than a week to cross from Liverpool to New York,  and the demand for quicker transmission of transatlantic news, particularly  grain and cotton prices, was intense
One scheme called for laying a short cable  from Nova Scotia to Newfoundland, intercepting steamers as they passed that  easternmost outpost of North America, and telegraphing their news ahead to  New York, beating the arrival of the ship itself by two or three days
When  Cyrus Field (1819–92), a wealthy young New York merchant, learned of the  project in 1854, he hatched a plan for something far more ambitious: a cable  directly from Newfoundland to Ireland, with connections at either end to  New York and (1)(2) To lay a cable across nearly 2,000 miles of open ocean  would be an audacious enterprise, far beyond anything previously attempted,  but Field foresaw great advantages—and profi ts—if it could be done, and he  set about securing landing rights and organizing a company
He soon recog- nized, however, that the capital and expertise needed to make the cable a real- ity could be found only in (1)(2) Backed by Brett and other British investors,  Field formed the Atlantic Telegraph Company in London in October 1856 and  optimistically promised to lay the cable the following summer
Whatever the enthusiasm of Field and his partners, others had serious doubts that an Atlantic cable could ever be made to work
Many of their con- cerns centered on “retardation,” a troubling phenomenon telegraphers had  fi rst encountered on underground lines and submarine cables a few years be - fore
Faraday brought it to wider notice in January 1854, when, in a lecture at  the Royal Institution, he described experiments the telegraph engineer Latimer  Clark (1822–98) had shown him in which short, sharp signals sent into one end  of a cable or long underground line emerged at the other greatly stretched out  and noticeably delayed
This posed a serious problem for telegraphers, for it  meant that if they tried to send too many words per minute along their cables,  the successive pulses of current would run together into an indecipherable  blur
The effect worsened with length, calling into question whether a cable  across the Atlantic would be able to carry enough messages per day to pay for  itself
Retardation might be bad news for telegraphers, but Faraday welcomed its  discovery as providing “remarkable illustrations of some fundamental princi- ples of electri city, and strong confi rmation of the truthfulness of the view  which I put forth sixteen years ago” on the relationship between induction and  conduction
⁶ Since the late 1830s, Faraday had been arguing that a wire cannot  carry a steady current until the insulating dielectric around it has been thrown  into a state of electrical strain, with the consequent storage of a certain amount  of charge on the surface of the wire
The inductive capacity (or “capacitance”)  of most ordinary circuits, including overhead telegraph wires, is so low and the  stored charge thus so small that the whole process occurs almost instanta- neously; indeed, since they saw no delay in the fl ow of current, most scientists  of the time regarded Faradays idea that induction precedes conduction as a  needless complication
On submarine cables and underground lines, however,  the seawater or damp earth surrounding the insulated wire acts like the outer  coating of a Leyden jar, greatly increasing the capacitance of the line and en - abling it to hold much more charge
This slowed down the process of induc- tion and produced the retardation Clark and others had observed; it also made  Faradays ideas seem less like fanciful theorizing and more like a possible key  to solving one of telegraph engineers most vexing practical problems
Werner von Siemens had noticed retardation effects on his own under- ground lines as early as 1849, leading him, he later said, to take Faradays ideas  on dielectrics and electrical conduction more seriously than others in Ger- many did at the time
Siemenss buried lines failed after just a year or two, 6

however, as their insulation succumbed to the combined effects of hurried  construction, mistakes in handling materials, and the depredations of rats with  a taste for gutta-percha
The Prussian telegraph authorities soon replaced them  with overhead wires, bringing the German encounter with retardation phe- nomena to an early end
The British, too, pulled up most of their underground  lines in the mid-1850s, but by then their growing network of undersea cables  meant they could not escape from retardation problems so easily
Among those intrigued by the discovery of retardation was William Thom- son, who late in 1854 combined Faradays ideas about induction with equations  drawn from the theory of heat fl ow to produce a mathematical theory of how  pulses of current travel along wires
Thomsons theory marked a crucial ad - vance; Oliver Heaviside, later a great expert on telegraphic propagation, called Atlantic Telegraph Cable aboard  the (1)(1)(1) Niagara in
When Cyrus Field and his partners were  laying plans for the fi rst Atlantic telegraph  cable, they realized that even though the  cable would be only ⅝ inch in diameter— scarcely as thick as a persons fi nger—the  more than 2,000 miles of it needed to span  the ocean would be too bulky to fi t into  any single ship then afl oat
They therefore  split the cable between the (1)(1)(1) Niagara, on loan from the (1)(1) Navy, and (1)(1)(1)  Agamemnon of the British Royal Navy,  with the two lengths to be spliced together  in mid-ocean
The project drew lavish cov- erage in the press, including this full page  engraving from the Illustrated Times of London showing the cable being paid out  from the deck of the Niagara during the  fi rst, failed attempt in August 1857

it “the fi rst step towards getting out of the wire into the dielectric
”⁷ Thomson  showed that the retardation on a cable is proportional to both its resistance and  its capacitance, and so would be lowest on a fat copper wire covered by a thick  layer of gutta-percha
This was bad news for proponents of the Atlantic proj- ect, who hoped to use a thin, cheap cable rather than a thick, expensive one
Worse, Thomsons theory said that retardation would increase with the square  of the length of a cable
Extrapolating from the slow signaling—just a few  words per minute—achieved on a 300-mile cable recently laid in the Black  Sea, Thomson concluded in 1855 that a cable of the same thickness across the  Atlantic, six times as far, would suffer 36 times as much retardation and would  thus be too slow to pay for itself
(1) (1) Wildman Whitehouse (1816–90), a English surgeon turned electrical  experimenter, tried to blunt Thomsons criticisms, announcing in 1856 that  tests on actual cables showed the “law of squares” to be no more than “a fi ction  of the schools
”⁸ Field was delighted to hear this and quickly brought White- house into the Atlantic Telegraph Company as its “electrician,” in charge of all  electrical arrangements
Thomson stood by his theory, declaring that White- house had misinterpreted his own experiments, but conceded that he had been  hasty in blaming the slow signaling on the Black Sea cable principally on re - tardation (poorly adjusted instruments were apparently the main culprit); he  concluded that with careful handling, an Atlantic cable of ordinary thickness  should be able to carry signals at a slow but usable rate
In December 1856, Glasgow investors elected Thomson to the board of directors of the Atlantic  Telegraph Company, and thereafter he worked closely on the project
Rushing to meet the ambitious schedule he had promised his investors,  Field ordered over 2,000 miles of relatively thin cable, only ⅝ inch in diame- ter—about as thick as a mans thumb
Whitehouse performed some simple  electrical tests, declared the cable fi t for service, and watched from shore as a  small group of ships set out in August 1857 to lay it across the (1)(2) Just  over 300 miles out from Ireland, however, the cable snapped
Dejected, the  fl otillas crew turned back to unload the remaining coils while Field and his  backers regrouped to try again the next year
Over the winter Fields engineers  devised and built improved laying machinery, but they left the cable itself to  sit for months in the open air, its gutta-percha insulation steadily deteriorat- 7

After three more failed attempts in June 1858, the fl otilla set out in July to  make one last try
This time everything fi nally went right, and on 5 August 1858 the word went out from Ireland and Newfoundland that the Atlantic cable had  been successfully completed
It was immediately hailed in speeches, sermons,  and editorials as the great wonder of the age; a celebration in New York became  so exuberant that City Hall caught fi re and nearly burned down
There was a troubling delay, however, before the cable delivered up its fi rst  messages
During the laying, the operators had received signals aboard ship on World Cable Map,
By the end of the nineteenth century, the  network of submarine telegraph cables  reached into almost every part of the  globe
A short-lived cable had fi rst been  laid across the Atlantic in 1858, and two  more permanent ones in 1866; in the  1870s, cables were laid to India, Australia,  and Japan and along the coasts of Africa  and South (1)(2) The fi rst cable across  the Pacifi c, shown here as a dashed line  running from Canada to Australia and  New Zealand, was completed in 1902; a  second, starting from San Francisco, reached Hawaii later that year and was  extended to Guam and the Philippines in  1903
The great majority of the cables laid  between 1850 and World War I were built,  owned, and operated by British fi rms
The  demands and opportunities presented by  the cable industry did much to shape Brit- ish work in electrical physics in the second  half of the nineteenth century

Thomsons “mirror galvanometer,” a sensitive instrument that used a beam of  refl ected light in place of the usual heavy pointer and so was able to show the  passage of even the weakest currents
Once the ends of the cable had been  landed, however, Whitehouse hooked up his own much heavier relays, which  proved unable to receive readable signals
In desperation, he began sending jolts  of current from a fi ve-foot induction coil rippling down the cable, further  damaging its already fragile insulation, but even then could not get his relays  to respond
After about a week, the exasperated board of directors dismissed  Whitehouse and turned the Irish end of the cable over to (1)(2) Using  batteries and his mirror galvanometer, he managed to send and receive a sub- stantial number of messages over the next few weeks, but the condition of the  cable steadily deteriorated
By early September it was dead
The Atlantic cable  had aroused enormous pride and enthusiasm on both sides of the ocean, mak- ing its demise doubly discouraging
The public came to look upon oceanic  cable telegraphy as a great failed technology, an impression that was reinforced  in 1860 by the collapse, at enormous cost to the British government, of a cable  laid down the Red Sea and on to (1)(2)
In 1859 the badly battered Atlantic Telegraph Company joined with the  British government to form a committee to investigate and advise on the whole  subject of submarine telegraphy
What had gone wrong, and was there any  way to put it right
The “Joint Committee” took testimony from experts, com- missioned experiments, and drew up a massive report, published in 1861, that  be  came the bible of cable telegraphy
It identifi ed serious mistakes in the de - sign, manufacture, and handling of the Atlantic and Red Sea cables and de - clared that it was these, rather than anything intrinsic to oceanic telegraphy,  that had led to their failure
Cable telegraphy presented “no difficulties  >>>>>>   which skill and prudence cannot and will not overcome”; with due care, the  report concluded, “this class of enterprise may prove as successful as it has  hitherto been disastrous
”⁹ The committee particularly stressed the impor- tance of making accurate electrical measurements and exercising careful qual- ity control during manufacture and laying
The committee laid much of the  blame for the failure of the 1858 cable on Whitehouses shoulders (perhaps  even more than the large share he deserved), declaring his methods to be slip- shod and unscientifi c
In contrast, it pointed to Thomsons work as proof of  how much science, properly pursued, could contribute to the success of cable   telegraphy

Report of the Joint Committee on the Construction of Submarine Telegraph Cables (London:  HMSO, 1861), pp
xii, xxxvi
The report of the Joint Committee stimulated important scientifi c work,  particularly the formation in September 1861 of the British Association Com- mittee on Electrical (1)(2) As we will see in the next chapter, this commit- tee, led by Thomson, Maxwell, and the cable engineer Fleeming Jenkin, went  on to develop essentially the system of electrical units—the ohms, volts, and  amperes—still used today, while also laying the foundations for major advances  in both electrical theory and practice
Encouraged by the report of the Joint Committee, Field and the Atlantic  Telegraph Company decided to try again and settled on a design for a new and  thicker cable, in line with Thomsons advice
Investors, however, were under- standably leery at the prospect of sinking another £500,000 (the equivalent of  about $50 million today) at the bottom of the sea
The project was on the verge  of stalling completely when John Penders newly formed Telegraph Construc- tion and Maintenance Company offered to build and lay the cable largely at  its own risk
The cable was duly made and tested, and the Great Eastern, the  only ship afl oat big enough to carry the full length, was chartered to lay it
The  great ship set out from Ireland in July 1865 and was nearly two-thirds of the  way across when once again the cable snapped and sank
The project seemed  cursed, but Field and Pender held fi rm and set about raising the money to try  again the next year
This time all went smoothly, and on 27 July 1866 the cable  was landed at Hearts Content, (1)(2) The Great Eastern then re - turned to the spot where the 1865 cable had broken, grappled it up from the  bottom of the sea, spliced on a length of new cable, and completed it to New- foundland
By September the Atlantic was spanned by two working cables,  and Europe and North America have been in direct telegraphic contact ever  since
The success of the Atlantic cables sparked a global boom in cable laying
Additional lines were laid across the Atlantic, and new ones were laid to India  (1870), Hong Kong (1871), and Australia (1871) and along the coasts of South  America (1873–76) and Africa (1879)
By 1880 the oceans of the world were  spanned by nearly 90,000 miles of cables; by 1900, that total had more than  doubled
The overwhelming majority of these cables were built, laid, and run  by British companies—indeed, most were controlled by one man, “cable king”  John Pender (1816–96)
Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth  centuries, Londons position at the center of the sprawling web of submarine  cables enabled it to control much of the global fl ow of information, greatly  bolstering British imperial and commercial power
Many factors, including  British control of the gutta-percha market in Singapore, made it hard for other  countries to crack the British cable monopoly
The most important single fac- tor, however, was British dominance of the relevant technical expertise
Cable  telegraphy was the most advanced “high-tech” industry of its day, and the store  of specialized knowledge and skills that British scientists and engineers had  been building up since the 1850s gave them an almost insurmountable advan- tage over later entrants into the fi eld
William Thomson stands as a fi tting symbol of the intertwining of British  electrical science and cable technology in the nineteenth century
From 1854 until his death in 1907, he combined pioneering theoretical and experimental  work on electricity and magnetism with close involvement in the practicalities  of submarine telegraphy, including sailing on many of the early cable-laying  expeditions
He was knighted in 1866 for his work on the Atlantic cables and  earned a fortune from his patents on telegraphic instruments and apparatus
When he was raised to the peerage in January 1892, Thomson had to choose a  new name to go with his new title
He soon settled on “Kelvin,” after a small  river that fl ows near the University of Glasgow, but only after friends and fam- ily had half-jokingly suggested he instead call himself “Lord (1)(2)”¹⁰ It would  have been an apt choice, refl ecting not only the main source of his public fame  but also the stimulus for some of his most important scientifi c work

Ether and Field Field theory turned the usual view of physical reality on its head
In place of  the old image of isolated bits of matter acting directly on each other across  empty space, fi eld theory pictured space as fi lled with energy and activity, criss- crossed by lines of force that were in a sense more real than the charges and  currents on which they converged
In fi eld theory, the whole comes before its  parts, with those parts drawing their signifi cance, even in a sense their exis- tence, from their place and role within the surrounding fi eld
Michael Faraday  planted the seeds of the fi eld approach in the 1830s and cultivated it further in  the 1840s, but fi eld theory did not fully fl ower until the 1850s and 1860s, when  William Thomson and James Clerk Maxwell cast Faradays ideas into mathe- matical form and tied them to the notion, drawn from the wave theory of light,  that space is fi lled with an all-pervading ether
Maxwell and his successors went  on to develop a comprehensive fi eld theory of electricity and magnetism, in - cluding an electromagnetic theory of light, while striving also to explain it all  by the workings of a mechanical ether
Field theory was a distinctively British pursuit in the nineteenth century;  most physicists in other countries stuck with action-at-a-distance theories  until the 1880s and 1890s
These national differences had many sources, but  perhaps the most important was rooted in British dominance of cable teleg- raphy
The peculiarities of signaling through long submarine cables exposed  British scientists and engineers to problems of electrical propagation that their  counterparts in other countries did not encounter, and so led the British to pay  special attention to fi eld effects and the role the dielectric plays in electromag- netic phenomena
The British cable industry also spurred work in precision  elec trical measurement that bolstered Maxwells theory
There is an irony here,  for in a way the British cable industry dug its own grave
By fostering the  develop ment of Maxwells fi eld theory, cable telegraphy helped lead to the  discovery of electromagnetic waves
This led in turn to the invention of wire- less telegraphy, or radio—the technology that, in the twentieth century, fi nally gave other countries a way to break the monopoly on global communications  that Britain had built on its network of submarine cables
Faraday in a New Light As his health improved in the early 1840s, Faraday returned to the laboratory  and to his pursuit of a unifi ed theory of electromagnetism
He took a major  step in that direction in September 1845, when he discovered that magnetic  forces can alter the polarization of a beam of light
The “Faraday effect” and a  string of related discoveries clinched his belief that lines of force represent real  physical states of the electromagnetic medium
When Thomson and Maxwell  took up the Faraday effect in the 1850s, they used its evidence of a link between  magnetism and light to open a new chapter in theorizing about the ether and  electromagnetism
The orthodox view that electric and magnetic forces act directly between  isolated particles had been laid down by Charles Coulomb in the 1780s and  elaborated mathematically by the Laplacian physicist (1)-(1) (1)(2) (1)-(1) Am - pères work in the 1820s fi t with this approach, and in the 1840s the German  physicists Franz Neumann and Wilhelm Weber independently extended it to  account for electromagnetic induction
Neumann and Weber combined math- ematical skill with mastery of the art of precision measurement, and they con- structed theories that fi t the experimental data very well
Neumanns theory  was highly abstract, however, and his “electrodynamic potential” gave little in - sight into any underlying physical processes, while Webers theory, based on  forces acting directly between streams of electric particles, relied on many un - testable hypotheses
Webers basic law also required the force between two  particles to vary with their velocity, leading to apparent violations of the con- servation of energy and landing him in a long and heated dispute with Her- mann von (1)(2)
Faraday paid little attention to these mathematical theories, preferring to  work along his own more intuitive lines
Many physicists questioned, however,  whether his ideas about lines of force and electric induction were consistent  with the results Coulomb and Poisson had established
Faraday argued that his  discoveries about specifi c inductive capacity and induction along curved lines  proved that electric forces act contiguously, hopping from one molecule to the  next across a medium, rather than acting directly at a distance, as Coulomb  had claimed
Did this mean that Coulombs law was wrong
Or, as seemed  more likely to most physicists of the day, did it simply mean that Faraday had  misconstrued the meaning of his own experiments
Taking up the question in the early 1840s, Thomson showed that Faradays  results did not contradict Coulombs and that, when applied to a medium  whose parts could be electrically polarized, the two theories were mathemati- cally equivalent
Thomson was not really endorsing Faradays approach—his  papers could just as easily be read as defending Coulombs—but as he looked  more closely, he began to see real strengths in Faradays way of treating electric  and magnetic phenomena
He was par ticularly struck by Faradays idea that  electric induction physically strains the dielec tric across which it acts
Physi- cists had long known that subjecting a piece of glass to mechanical strain  (bending or twisting it, for example) can affect the polarization of light passing  through it, and in August 1845 Thomson wrote to ask Faraday if he had ever  noticed a similar effect in a dielectric under electric induction, such as the glass  in a Leyden jar
Faraday replied that he had not, but he set out to see if mag- netic forces might produce a similar effect
He soon found that when he sent  a beam of polarized light through a piece of glass placed across the poles of a  strong electromagnet, or within a long coil of wire carrying a strong current,  the plane of polarization was turned in the same direction as the fl ow of cur- rent in the coil
Faraday declared that he had directly “illuminated” a line of  magnetic force, an achievement that made the lines seem more real to him  than ever
Maxwell later remarked, somewhat prematurely, that the discovery of the  magnetic rotation of light “did not lead to such important practical applica- tions as some of Faradays earlier discoveries”; in fact, it now provides the basis  for some types of rewrit able optical disks and other technologies that combine  optics with electronics
Maxwell was certainly right, however, when he said  that Faradays discovery had proved “of the highest value to science” by provid- ing what amounted to an inside look at the way magnetic forces affect both  light and matter
¹ Faradays work on magneto-optic rotation and related discoveries about  how lines of magnetic force pass through different kinds of matter strength- ened his belief in what he now began to call the magnetic “fi eld,” and he soon  began to speculate more openly about it
In an 1846 lecture on “ray vibrations,”  he suggested that particles of matter may be simply “centers of force” at which  electric and magnetic lines converge, and that these lines of force might serve  to explain light as well
Faraday accepted the wave theory of light but had  doubts about the ether, suspecting it was just another imaginary subtle fl uid

But how could there be waves without something to carry them
Perhaps,  Faraday suggested, light is simply vibrations of the lines of electric and mag- netic force that stretch from particle to particle across space
He had already  shown that magnetic forces can affect light, and it seemed plausible to him that  light might ultimately be electromagnetic
The idea was not without prob- lems; for one thing, it seemed hard to believe that individual lines of force  stretch from the sun and each of the distant stars to the molecules in our eye- balls and that the light we see is just the twanging of these lines
Sketchy as it  was, however, Faradays notion of “ray vibrations” contained a fi rst hint of  what, in the hands of Maxwell and his successors, would become the electro- magnetic theory of light and later the technology of radio waves
Before Maxwell took up the task in the mid-1850s, almost the only attempts  to express Faradays ideas in mathematical form had come in a few terse papers  by (1)(2) Maxwell had fi rst studied electricity and magnetism at Edin- burgh, but when he arrived at Cambridge in 1850, he found that the mathe- matical theory of those subjects, as well as of heat, had been dropped from the  curriculum because their scientifi c foun da tions were regarded as not yet suffi- ciently secure
During his student days Maxwell focused on optics and mechan- ics, but after completing his degree in January 1854, he began to cast around The Faraday Effect  on Polarized Light In 1845, Michael Faraday found that when  he passed a polarized beam of light  through a piece of glass that he had placed  in a strong magnetic fi eld, the plane of  polarization of the light was turned  through a measurable angle
This “Faraday  effect” provided the fi rst clear evidence  connecting magnetism to light, and in the 1850s it led William Thomson and James  Clerk Maxwell to important insights about  the structure of the ether, the workings of  the electromagnetic fi eld, and the nature of  light
In particular, Faradays discovery  convinced both Thomson and Maxwell  that magnetic fi elds must be fi lled with  “molecular vortices,” tiny bits of matter or  ether that whirled around the lines of  force
for a new topic
This was just as Faradays lecture at the Royal Institution about  retardation on telegraph cables was attracting attention, and whether stimu- lated by this or for reasons of his own, Maxwell decided to take up electricity
He knew Thomson through family connections and wrote to ask him what he  ought to read
Maxwell soon dove into Faradays Experimental Researches in  Electricity, absorbing his accounts of phenomena and his characteristic way of  thinking about them
Maxwell was a strongly visual thinker and clearly pre- ferred Faradays robust fi elds and lines of force to what he saw as the abstract  attractions and repulsions of Webers theory, which he also read at this time
Most other theorists, however, would not take Faradays ideas seriously until  they could be cast into rigorous mathematical form
Building on Thomsons  earlier work, Maxwell set out to do so
Over the winter of 1855–56, Maxwell wrote a long paper, “On Faradays  Lines of Force,” in which he laid out what he called a “physical analogy” be - tween Faradays lines of electric and magnetic force and the lines of fl ow of an  imaginary fl uid
Picture positive and negative charges, or the opposite poles of  a magnet, as sources and sinks of a fl uid that is generated at one pole and dis- appears into nothingness at the other
In a stable fi eld, such a fl uid would fl ow  smoothly along the lines of force, as if confi ned within imaginary tubes
These  tubes would grow fatter, and the fl ow within them slower, where the forces are  weakest, and would be thinner and their fl ow more rapid where the forces are  strongest
Maxwell showed that the mathematical rules governing the paths of  such fl ows exactly match those governing Faradays lines of force, and that the  known laws of attraction, repulsion, and inductive capacity could all be derived  from this fl uid model
Maxwell never meant for these tubes of fl uid to be taken  literally; he had introduced them, he said, solely to illustrate Faradays ideas  about lines of force by relating them to the more familiar phenomenon of fl uid  fl ow
Maxwells ambitions went far beyond mere illustration, however, and he  said he hoped his fl ow analogy might open the way toward “a mature theory,  in which physical facts will be physically explained
”² Maxwell saw inklings of such a true physical theory in a paper Thomson  published in 1856
By analyzing the Faraday effect, Thomson had shown that  the magnetic rotation of light could occur only if something—either bits of  ether or molecules of matter—was physically spinning around along the lines  of magnetic force
The Atlantic telegraph project was then drawing Thomson  more deeply into electrical topics, while his work with Joule had already con- 2
James Clerk Maxwell, “On Faradays Lines of Force” (1855), in Niven, Scientifi c Papers of  Maxwell, 1:159
vinced him of the truth of the kinetic theory of heat
His Glasgow engineering  colleague (1) (1) (1) Rankine had recently published a theory of heat based on  hypothetical “molecular vortices,” and now Thomson thought the Faraday ef - fect might point the way toward a theory in which heat, light, electromagne- tism, and perhaps even the structure of matter itself would be explained by the  invisible motions of a mechanical ether
Thomson was laying out an ambitious  program of mechanical explanation that would occupy him and many other  leading physicists, especially in Britain, for the rest of the century
He did not  immediately take up the task himself, however, and it was Maxwell who devel- oped Thomsons analysis of the Faraday effect into a remarkable new theory of  the electromagnetic fi eld
Maxwells Whirling Ether Writing in 1882, Maxwells friend Lewis Campbell said he wished he could  “recall the date (1857
) of a drive down the Vale of Orr [near Maxwells home  in Scotland], during which he described to me for the fi rst time, with extraor- dinary volubility, the swift, invisible motions by which magnetic and galvanic  phenomena were to be accounted for
It was like listening to a fairy-tale
”³ Maxwell published a detailed account of his theory in several installments in  1861–62 under the title “On Physical Lines of (1)(2)”⁴ With its intricate array  of whirling vortices and “idle wheel particles,” Maxwells model of the ether  struck many readers at the time, and has struck many ever since, as a fairy tale,  an example of the Victorian scientifi c imagination run wild
Complex and  contrived as it was, however, Maxwells vortex model proved immensely fruit- ful, leading him to deep insights about the workings of the electromagnetic  fi eld and its relationship to light
Maxwell had already shown that magnetic forces can be explained by ten- sions acting along the lines of force and pressures pushing out laterally from  them
Taking Thomsons analysis of the Faraday effect as his starting point, he  set out in “Physical Lines” to show that a spinning motion in the magnetic  fi eld could provide a mechanical cause for these tensions and pressures
In stead  of picturing lines of force as tubes of fl owing fl uid, as he had in “Faradays  Lines,” Maxwell now suggested that they were long vortices or whirlpools whose  rapid spinning made them bulge out sideways and contract along their lengths
In Part I of his paper, he showed how bundles of such vortices, each much 3

smaller than an ordinary molecule, could account mechanically for known  magnetic forces
In particular, he showed that the kinetic energy of an array of  such vortices, whether pictured as threads of whirling ether or strings of spin- ning spherical cells, would be spread across space in just the same way that, in  Faradays theory, magnetic energy is distributed across the fi eld
Maxwell ad - mitted he did not yet have conclusive proof, but by 1861 he felt all but certain  that magnetic fi elds are really fi lled with vortices of whirling ether
He even did  an experiment to see if the vortices acted as tiny gyroscopes, as in principle  they should, but his apparatus was not sensitive enough to give any defi nite  result
So far so good—but as Maxwell noted, neighboring vortex cells would all  be spinning in the same direction, forcing their adjoining edges to rub together  and interfere
How could he avoid this problem and, if possible, enable the  vortices to pass their motion smoothly from one to the next
Using a trick  borrowed from mechanical engineering, Maxwell opened Part II of “Physical  Lines” by adding a layer of small round particles between his vortex cells
Since  these would spin in the opposite direction from the vortices, they would act as  “idle wheels” to pass along rotational motion, as was often done in gearing for  machinery
In a stable magnetic fi eld, all of the vortices would turn together at  a steady rate and the idle wheels would simply spin in place
Maxwell did not  provide fi xed axles for his idle wheels, however, and though he treated the  wheels in electrical insulators as bound within a single molecule, those in a  conductor would, he said, be free to move in any direction
Thus if some of  the vortices in a conductor began to spin more quickly, corresponding to a  changing magnetic fi eld, the row of wheels caught between these faster vortices  and the adjoining slower ones would be pushed along in the direction the  faster ones were turning
This fl ow of idle wheel particles corresponded, Max- well said, to an electric current produced by electromagnetic induction
As  frictional forces brought the fl ow to a stop, and as the rapidly spinning wheels  brought the slower vortices up to speed, everything would gradually settle  down to a steady spinning in place, corresponding to the stable magnetic fi eld  left after the induced currents had died away
Conversely, if we could some- how push a row of idle wheels along, they would force the vortices on either  side to turn in opposite directions, corresponding to an electric current setting  up rings of magnetic force around itself
Maxwell sometimes referred to his idle wheel particles as “electricity,” but  it is important to recognize that he did not regard them as carrying charge or  being at all like Coulombs and Webers particles of electric fl uid; Maxwells  idle wheels were in no sense precursors of the electron
Maxwells ether was purely mechanical; the motion and pressure of his vortices and idle wheels  produced what he identifi ed as electric and magnetic forces, but they did so  mechanically, not electromagnetically
Maxwell did not look on an electric  current as a stream of charged particles fl owing within a wire, but instead, as a  fi eld phenomenon defi ned primarily by the pattern of magnetic forces that  appeared in the surrounding space
That in his model a row of idle wheel  particles was pushed along in the direction of the current was, in Maxwells  view, distinctly secondary
Maxwells Vortex Model  of the Electromagnetic Ether In a long paper, “On Physical Lines of  Force,” which appeared in installments in  1861 and 1862, James Clerk Maxwell laid  out an intricate mechanical model of the  ether, from which he derived the fi rst ver- sion of his electromagnetic theory of light
The hexagonal cells shown here represent  spinning vortices of ether, while the  smaller circles represent “idle wheel parti- cles” that serve to pass rotational motion  from one layer of vortices to the next
The  rotation of the vortices represents a mag- netic fi eld, Maxwell said, with the lines of  magnetic force running along the axes of  rotation (shown here as a plus sign for vor- tices spinning counterclockwise and as a  minus for those spinning clockwise)
If all  of the vortices in a region are spinning at a  steady rate, corresponding to an unchang- ing magnetic fi eld, the idle wheel particles  will simply rotate in place; if the rate of  spin of the vortices changes, however, the  idle wheel particles will be pushed along  between the vortices until their rates of  spin equalize
Conversely, if a line of idle  wheel particles is forced along between two  layers of vortices (as shown here from A to  B ), the vortices on either side will be forced to turn in opposite directions, cor- responding to the magnetic fi eld set up  around an electric current
In the last installments of his paper,  Maxwell examined what would happen if  the vortices were elastic, like pieces of rub- ber
He found that the medium would  then be able to convey waves; moreover,  measurements of electric and magnetic  constants indicated that the waves would  travel at the speed of light—strongly sug- gesting, he said, that light itself consists of  waves in the same medium that exerts elec- tric and magnetic forces
� James Clerk Maxwell, “On Physical  Lines of Force,” Philosophical Magazine 23 (1862): plate 1
Toward the end of Part II, Maxwell admitted that the idea of idle wheels  rolling along the rims of magnetic vortices might seem “somewhat awkward”  and said he did not “bring it forward as a mode of connexion existing in  nature, or even as that which I would willingly assent to as an electrical hy - pothesis
”⁵ This passage has often been cited by those who claim that Maxwell  never meant for his vortex model to be taken seriously and only used it to ex - plore a crude analogy between mechanical and electromagnetic systems
In  fact, Maxwell made it clear that the idle wheels were the only part of his model  that he considered “awkward,” and that he thought the evidence for the real  existence of magnetic vortices remained strong
Contrived and clumsy as they  were, Maxwells idle wheels had the merit in his eyes of showing that mechan- ical causes could in principle account for electromagnetic phenomena, and so  of pointing the way toward a mature theory in which the true mechanism of  the fi eld would be revealed
Part II of “Physical Lines” appeared in April and May 1861, and Maxwell  originally meant for that to be the end of it
Over the summer, however, he  began looking for a way to make his model account for electrostatic forces
When he found one, he got an unexpected bonus: evidence that light itself  might be waves in the same medium that produces electric and magnetic  forces
He took up his paper again and added two new parts, published early  in 1862, that proved even more important than the earlier installments
Maxwell already knew that to make his vortex cells spin properly and bulge  in the middle in the way needed to produce magnetic forces, they had to be  elastic solids—they must, like rubber balls, yield to pressure and then spring  back when it was released
As we have seen, he also assumed that in conductors  the idle wheels would be free to move in any direction while in insulators they  would be bound within a single molecule
What happened, then, at the bound- ary between a conductor and an insulator—for instance, between the plates of  a Leyden jar
The elasticity of the vortex cells gave the machinery some “give,”  so that as the idle wheels moving through the conductor butted up against the  insulating dielectric, they were not immediately brought to a stop
Instead,  they strained and twisted the vortices within the dielectric until the distorted  cells pushed back hard enough to make the whole system lock up
This cor- responded to the charging of a Leyden jar, with energy being stored in the  strained vortices just as it was in a dielectric subject to electric induction
Max- well even used energy considerations to show that the patterns of elastic strain 5
Maxwell, “On Physical Lines of Force, Part I” (1861), in Niven, Scientifi c Papers of Max- well, 1:486
in the vortices would produce attractive and repulsive forces just like those  between electrostatic charges
Maxwell soon realized a deeper point: the process of straining the vortices  would itself constitute a fl eeting electric current
In the short time it took to  twist the vortices until they locked up, the idle wheel particles around each  vortex cell would be slightly displaced from their initial positions
This brief  motion did not amount to a regular current, Maxwell said, but it was the be - ginnings of one, and it would occur even in nonconductors, including in seem- ingly empty space
The “displacement current” generated by a changing elec- tric force became a crucial part of Maxwells fi eld theory and later provided the  keystone he needed to complete his system of electromagnetic equations
The next implication Maxwell drew from his model was even more nota- ble
If the electromagnetic medium is an elastic solid, he reasoned, then it must  be able to vibrate and carry transverse waves like those we see in a block of  rubber or a bowl of jelly
We can fi nd the speed of such waves in two different  ways: by timing their passage directly, or by separately measuring the density  and rigidity of the medium and then inserting those values into the appropri- ate wave equation
In the summer of 1861, Maxwell worked out a formula that  expressed the speed at which waves would travel through his vortex medium  in terms of known electric and magnetic constants
He had to make several  simplifying assumptions, and some of his methods of calculation were later  criticized, but his fi nal result was certainly eye-catching: the waves in his vortex  medium appeared to travel at almost exactly the speed of light
The key number in Maxwells theory was the ratio between the electrostatic  and electromagnetic units of charge
Weber and Kohlrausch had measured this  “ratio of units” in Germany in 1856 and found it to be a velocity equiva lent to  310,740 kilometers per second, or 193,088 miles per second
The best fi gure  Maxwell could fi nd for the speed of light, from measurements the French  physicist Hippolyte Fizeau had made using a rapidly spinning toothed wheel,  was 193,188 miles per second
This was an astonishingly close match, and Max- well initially regarded it as conclusive; in Part  III of “Physical Lines,” published  in January 1862, he declared that “we can scarcely avoid the inference that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of elec- tric and magnetic phenomena
”⁶ In fact, the match was a little too good to be  true; Maxwell had seen a mistaken report of Fizeaus result, which should have  been 195,647 miles per second, and Weber and Kohlrauschs measurement of 6
Maxwell, “On Physical Lines, Part III” (1862), in Niven, Scientifi c Papers of Maxwell, 1:500; the emphasis is Maxwells
the ratio of electrical units was open to considerable uncertainty
Nail ing down  those numbers and establishing just how close to each other they really were  would prove to be a demanding task, as Maxwell himself soon found
When the last two parts of “Physical Lines” appeared in 1862, Maxwell did  not yet have a fully formed electromagnetic theory of light
He had a mechan- ical theory of light as waves in an elastic solid, and a mechanical theory of  electric and magnetic forces as the strain and motion of his vortices and idle  wheels
He also had a numerical coincidence that suggested his vortices were  made of the same elastic substance that carried the waves of light
He was not,  however, able to describe these waves in purely electromagnetic terms, and  when in the last part of his paper he tried to use his spinning vortices to explain  Faradays magnetic rotation of light—the discovery that had started it all—he  had only partial success
Maxwell felt sure he was on the trail of a deep truth  about electro magnetism and light, but he was not there yet
When “Physical Lines” fi rst appeared, most physicists regarded it as clever  but not entirely convincing
As one of Maxwells friends told him, the coinci- dence between the speed of light and the ratio of units was “a brilliant result,”  but it would take more than that to convince people that “every time an elec- tric current is produced, a little fi le of particles is squeezed out between rows  of wheels
”⁷ Maxwells model could account for most known electric and mag- netic phenomena, but it did not fi t the experimental evidence any better than  Webers theory did, and it required more hypotheses about the structure of the  ether than most physicists were willing to swallow
The main empirical point  in Maxwells favor was the apparent match between the speed of light and the  ratio of units, but it would take a lot of work, both theoretical and experimen- tal, to make that coincidence scientifi cally persuasive
To bolster his case, Max- well would need better electrical measurements
His pursuit of them over the  coming years would have far-reaching consequences for both high theory and  industrial technology
Cables, Ohms, and the Speed of Light As it happened, Maxwells desire in the early 1860s to pin down the value of  the ratio of units coincided with a push by the cable industry to adopt a stan- dard system of electrical units
The failure of the fi rst Atlantic cable led to  widespread calls for more accurate electrical testing and better quality control,  and particularly for a reliable and uniform standard of electrical resistance
Be - fore the 1860s, no such accepted standard existed, leaving cable engineers with 7
(1) (1) Monro to James Clerk Maxwell, 1861, in Campbell and Garnett, Maxwell, p(1)
no effective way to compare and combine their electrical measurements
Work- ing closely with scientists, they eventually settled on a unit of resistance, the  “ohm,” whose value was closely tied to the ratio of units and thus, on Max- wells theory, to the speed of light
Maxwell played a leading role in the labora- tory work needed to settle the value of the ohm and in subsequent efforts to  measure the ratio of units
He began this work in hopes it would strengthen  the evidence supporting his theory of the electromagnetic fi eld; what he per- haps did not anticipate was the important effect his encounter with the prac- ticalities of electrical measurement would have on the way he thought about  and formulated that theory
In its 1861 report, the Joint Committee on submarine telegraphy had put  much of the blame for the failure of the fi rst Atlantic cable on the inadequate  methods of electrical testing used by Wildman Whitehouse, the company elec- trician
Echoing remarks Thomson and others had made in their testimony,  the committee called for the adoption of standard measures of electrical re - sistance and capacity similar to the units of length and weight had that long  been established by law
Without such standards, the com mittee warned, engi- neers could not ensure the quality of the copper and gutta-percha used in their  cables, nor could they draw up accurate specifi cations or enforceable contracts
With proper standards, they would be able to measure and record the exact  resistance of each mile of cable they laid and, by tests performed on the shore  ends, could direct repair ships to the exact location of any breaks or faults in  the insulation
In the summer of 1861, Thomson set out to enlist the British  Association for the Advancement of Science to supply this need, and with the  help of a young cable engineer named Fleeming Jenkin (1833–85), he soon se - cured the appointment of a committee of physicists, chemists, and telegraph  engineers to devise an appropriate standard of electrical resistance
Thomson was not alone in pushing for the adoption of electrical stan- dards
At the same 1861 meeting of the British Association, two leading cable  engineers, Charles Bright (1832–88) and Latimer Clark (1822–98), issued their  own call for a connected system of units for electrical resistance, tension (or  voltage), current, and capacity
They laid out how the units would be related to  one another, principally through Ohms law (voltage � current � resistance),  and suggested the units be named for famous electrical researchers (“volt,”  “ohma,” “farad,” and so on)
They urged that the magnitudes of the units be  chosen to suit the practical needs of telegraphers and worried at fi rst that  Thomsons committee might focus too closely on purely scientifi c niceties
In  fact, the interests of cable engineers were always strongly represented on the  British Association committee, which both Bright and Clark later joined
The idea of defi ning a unit of electrical resistance was not new in the 1860s
In 1843 Wheatstone had proposed a unit based on the resistance of a copper  wire a foot long, and in the early 1850s telegraph engineers introduced their  own units based on the resistance of a mile or kilometer of wire of specifi ed  thickness
It soon became clear, how ever, that supposedly identical samples of  copper often differed widely in their resistivity; in 1857, Thomson found that  some lengths of wire intended for the fi rst Atlantic cable conducted only about  half as well as others
It turned out that very slight impurities could greatly  affect the resistivity of copper, calling into question any unit defi ned by a  specifi ed length and thick ness of wire
Mercury seemed to be free of this prob- lem, and in 1860 the German industrialist Werner von Siemens proposed a  unit based on the resistance of a tube of pure mercury one meter long and one  square millimeter in cross section
A primary mercury standard could be very  accurately made, Siemens said, and handier wire coils then calibrated against  it
Siemenss unit was not, however, part of any unifi ed system of units for  voltage, current, and other electrical quantities
Such a unifi ed system already existed in 1861, but almost no one used it
Building on Gausss earlier work on magnetism, in 1851 Weber had devised a  system of “absolute” electrical units based not on the resistance of a coil of  wire, but on the mechanical unit of force, and so ultimately on the fundamen- tal units of length, mass, and time—in the metric system, the meter, the gram,  and the second
He defi ned a unit of charge as one that (by Coulombs law)  would exert a unit of force on an identical charge a unit distance away, and a  unit of current as one that (by Ampères law) would exert a unit of force on a  parallel current a unit distance away
As we have seen, the ratio between the  resulting electrostatic and electromagnetic units of charge came out as a veloc- ity; according to Weber, who pictured currents as streams of electrical particles,  it was essentially the speed at which the electromagnetic repulsion between  two moving charges of opposite sign exactly balanced their electrostatic at - traction
He noted that this speed was very great, comparable to that of light,  but gave no particular signifi cance to this fact
Using Ohms law to defi ne the  electromagnetic unit of resistance, Weber showed that it, too, came out as a  velocity, but with a magnitude that was far too small to be of much practical  use: a piece of ordinary copper wire with a resistance of 1 meter per second  would be less than a thousandth of an inch long
Not surprisingly, most tele- graph engineers who knew of Webers system regarded it as little more than a  scientifi c curiosity
Thomson, who had one foot among the cable engineers and one among  the physicists, saw great merits in Webers system and pushed the British Asso- ciation committee to adopt a version of it
He had a simple answer to those  who objected that Webers resistance unit was too small: just use a convenient  decimal multiple
If the practical unit of resistance, the “British Association  unit” or ohm, were set equal to 10 million meters per second in Webers sys- tem, it would have a value close to that of Siemenss mercury unit and about  equal to the resistance of 200 feet of ordinary copper wire
For Thomson, the  great attraction of Webers system was the way it tied the units for resistance,  tension, and current together through the unit for work, or energy, “the great  connecting link between all physical measurements
”⁸ In particular, the prod- uct of electrical tension and current is power (in modern terms, volts � amps � watts), so that simple multiplication gives the rate at which a current performs  work or, as Joule had shown in the 1840s, generates heat in a resistor
Webers  focus on forces acting between particles refl ected his essentially La  placian ap - proach to electrical phenomena
Thomson, himself a pioneer of the new sci- ence of thermodynamics, saw an emphasis on energy relations as a way to  bring electrical measurements into line with the great unifying theme of nine- teenth-century physics
When the British Association committee began its work in 1861, Maxwell  was a young physics professor at Kings College (1)(2) He had little experi- ence with electrical measurements, but his vortex model had convinced him  that such measurements held the key to confi rming his electromagnetic theory  of light
Toward that end, he joined the British Association committee in 1862 and soon became one of its most active members
He and Fleeming Jenkin  coauthored an important paper “On the Elementary Relations between Elec- trical Measurements” and, with the physicist Balfour Stewart and the cable  engineer Charles Hockin, began the painstaking laboratory work required to  turn the ohm from an abstract unit into a physical standard
Using a technique  devised by Thomson, they spun a coil rapidly in the earths magnetic fi eld and,  by noting how a magnetized needle was defl ected by the induced currents,  calculated the absolute resistance of the coil
The committee issued its fi rst  tentative resistance standards at the end of 1863 and early in 1865 began sending  certifi ed copies of its official ohm to physicists, cable companies, and instru- ment makers around the world
Maxwells vortex model, with its whirling gears and idle wheels, has often  been seen as a prime example of physics done in the style of a Victorian me - chanical engineer, and so in a sense it was
But Maxwells work on the British 8

Association committee led him to think like an engineer in another and deeper  sense as well
At least for a time, he put aside speculations about the unseen  causes of phenomena and focused instead, as engineers generally do, on factors  he could measure and control
Amid his work on the ohm, Maxwell set out  to reformulate his theory of the electromagnetic fi eld in a way that did not  depend on hypothetical mechanisms in the ether and that tied his equations  far more closely to measurable electric and magnetic quantities
Rather than  imagining invisibly small vortices and idle wheels, he now assumed only that  the electromagnetic fi eld forms a connected mechanical system subject to the  general laws of dynamics
On this basis he proceeded to work out exactly how  changes in the electromagnetic state of one portion of the fi eld would affect that of another
He still believed that the ether possessed a complex mechan- ical structure—indeed, he still thought it probably contained tiny spinning  vortices—but he wanted to see how far he could go toward explaining observ- able electromagnetic phenomena without relying on any specifi c mechanical  hypotheses
The result, completed toward the end of 1864, was “A Dynamical Theory  of the Electromagnetic Field,” widely regarded as Maxwells greatest scientifi c  paper
Using the techniques of Lagrangian analysis, he derived a set of equa- tions that connected the electric and magnetic variables to each other and to  the energy stored in the fi eld
He also defi ned the “vector potential,” from  which other electric and magnetic quantities could be mathematically derived,  and clarifi ed the nature of the displacement current he had fi rst introduced in  “On Physical Lines of (1)(2)” Most notably, he expressed his theory of light in  purely electromagnetic form, free of its previous reliance on mechanical waves  in an elastic solid ether
When Maxwell wrote to friends about his “Dynamical Theory,” he cast his  achievement in terms of electrical measurements and the ratio of units
He  told Hockin, for example, that he had “cleared the electromagnetic theory of  light of all unwarrantable assumption, so that we may safely determine the ve - locity of light by measuring the attraction between bodies kept at a given dif- fer ence of potential, the value of which is known in electromagnetic mea- sure
”⁹ He went on to do just that, devising a delicate electrical balance that he  and Hockin used in 1868 to measure the ratio of units in terms of the British  Association ohm
It came out as 28
ohms or, taking the ohm at its intended  value of 10 million meters per second, 288,000 kilometers per second
This was 9
James Clerk Maxwell to Charles Hockin, 7 Sept(1), in Campbell and Garnett, Max- well, p(1)
about 3 percent below the best recent measurements of the speed of light— fairly close, though not quite close enough to convince skeptics that the elec- tromagnetic theory of light had been conclusively confi rmed
Maxwells value  for the ratio of units depended on that of the British Association ohm, how- ever, and in the 1870s it became clear that the standards the committee had  issued in 1865 were a little under their intended value
Once this was corrected,  and as methods for comparing currents and charges were further improved,  the best measurements of the ratio of units and of the speed of light gradually  converged on a value of about 299,800 kilometers per second, or 186,300 miles  per second
Maxwell regarded his theory of the electromagnetic fi eld, his work on the  ohm, and his measurement of the ratio of units as all of a piece, a confl uence  of high theory and practical technology in which each fed the other
Address- ing the British Association in 1871, Thomson cited Maxwells work on electri- cal units and the electromagnetic theory of light as a prime example of how  science gains from its ties to technology
“Those who perilled and lost their  money in the original Atlantic Telegraph” had hoped both to improve com- munications and earn themselves a profi t, Thomson said, but they scarcely  realized that when in the wake of its failure they turned to the British Associa- tion for a practical standard of resistance, they were “laying the foundation for  accurate electric measurement in every scientifi c laboratory in the world, and  initiating a train of investigation which now sends up branches into the loftiest  regions and subtlest ether of natural philosophy
”¹⁰ In 1865 Maxwell left Kings College London and retired to his Scottish estate  to take up the life of a country gentleman
He continued to produce a stream  of scientifi c papers, however, and returned to London at intervals to do exper- iments
He also began serving as an outside examiner for the Mathematical  Tripos at Cambridge, helping reintroduce questions on electricity, magnetism,  and heat
In part to meet the needs of students attempting to tackle such ques- tions, he began writing his great Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, pub- lished in two volumes in 1873
It was a rich but often confusing compendium  of mathematical and experimental techniques, in which Maxwell put little real  emphasis on his own distinctive ideas
Extracting “Maxwells theory” from Max-  wells Treatise would prove to be a demanding task
In the 1860s, Cambridge was coming under pressure to modernize its teach- ing of scientifi c subjects to better serve the practical needs of industrial (1)(2)

The university responded by establishing a new professorship of experimental  physics in 1871, with the promise of a laboratory to be funded by William  Cavendish, the Duke of Devonshire, a prominent aristocrat who was also a  leading industrialist
Thomson was the obvious fi rst choice for the chair, but  when he declined to leave Glasgow, the position was offered to Maxwell, who  accepted and set about teaching in borrowed rooms until the new Cavendish  Laboratory opened in 1874
Maxwell did surprisingly little to promote his new electrical theory at  Cam   bridge
He lectured on it, but most students preferred the more struc- tured teaching offered by specialized mathematics “coaches,” and by the late  1870s his classes often drew only three or four students
A few students came  to work with him at the Cavendish Laboratory, but Maxwell left them to fol- low their own noses and made little effort to draw them into exploring his  electrical theory
He began to revise his Treatise for a second edition, correcting  many errors and obscurities along the way, but had made it only a quarter of  the way through when he was struck down by cancer
He was 48 when he died  in November 1879
Maxwells electrical teachings were eventually taken up at Cambridge, both  by mathematical physicists in the colleges and by experimenters at the Caven- dish Laboratory, where in the 1880s his successor, Lord Rayleigh (1842–1919), focused on precision electrical measurement and the redetermination of the  ohm
But this was a slow process, and it was outside Cambridge, notably in  the context of cable telegraphy, that many of Maxwells ideas were fi rst and  most fully explored
Maxwellian Waves At the time of his death in 1879, Maxwells theory of the electromagnetic fi eld  was neither well understood nor widely accepted
Most physicists looked on it  as just one of several competing theories of electromagnetism
Indeed, other  than a somewhat shaky coincidence between the speed of light and the ratio  of electrical units, there was little direct empirical evidence in its favor
Ten  years later, the status of the theory was completely different
In Britain, a group  of young “Maxwellians” had traced out its chief implications and cast it into  much clearer and more compelling form, while in Germany, Heinrich Hertzs  detection of electromagnetic waves in 1888 had given the theory the dramatic  experimental confi rmation it had previously lacked
By the mid-1890s, Max- wells theory was almost universally accepted as the theory of electromagne- tism, and scientists and inventors were taking the fi rst steps toward putting  electromagnetic waves to use for wireless communications
Maxwells theory has been regarded ever since as one of the greatest achievements of modern  science, ranking with Newtons laws of motion; in 1964, the American physi- cist Richard Feynman (1918–88) went so far as to declare that “from a long view  of the history of mankind >>>>>> there can be little doubt that the most signifi - cant event of the nineteenth century will be judged as Maxwells discovery of  the laws of electrodynamics
”¹¹ The “Maxwells theory” that passed into general circulation in the 1890s was not, however, quite the same as the one Maxwell had originally pro- pounded
Many of its most distinctive features—the paths by which energy  fl ows through the fi eld, for example, and even the existence of electromagnetic  waves longer than those of light—were not clearly recognized by Maxwell him- self and had to be teased out later by others
Even the now standard form of  “Maxwells equations,” as a set of four vector equations connecting the electric  and magnetic fi eld strengths, was taken not from Maxwells own writings but  from those of Oliver Heaviside, a cable engineer turned mathematical physi- cist
Maxwell undoubtedly laid the foundations, but important parts of “Max- wells theory” were in fact the work of his successors
(1) (1) FitzGerald (1851–1901) was one of the fi rst to add signifi cantly to  Maxwells theory
As a young physicist at Trinity College Dublin, he heard in  1876 of the discovery that refl ection from the polished pole of a magnet could  alter the polarization of light
The phenomenon was closely related to the  Faraday effect, and FitzGerald thought Maxwells theory ought to be able to  ex  plain it
Maxwell, however, had never formulated a purely electromagnetic  theory of the refl ection of light, a gap FitzGerald fi lled by drawing on an al - most forgotten theory of the ether that his Dublin predecessor James MacCul- lagh (1809–47) had devised in 1839
MacCullaghs ether gave a good account  of most optical phenomena, but it had such peculiar properties—its parts did  not resist ordinary compression or distortion, but only rotation—that most  physicists rejected it as unworkable
FitzGerald showed, however, that the equa- tions of MacCullaghs rotational ether could be directly translated into those  of Maxwells electromagnetic fi eld, and that they brought along a full mathe- matical theory of the refl ection and refraction of light
FitzGerald went on to  clarify and correct several other points in Maxwells theory, particularly con- cerning the effects of moving charges
FitzGerald went badly astray, however, on the subject of electromagnetic  waves
In 1879 his friend and fellow Maxwellian Oliver Lodge (1851–1940), a 11
Richard (1) Feynman, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, 3 vols
(Reading, MA: Addison- Wesley, 1963–65), 2:1
London-trained experimentalist, hit on an intriguing idea
If Maxwells theory  was right, Lodge suggested, any rapidly oscillating electric current ought to  generate electromagnetic waves in the ether, and if we could push the fre- quency as high as 5 � 1014 cycles per second, corresponding to a wavelength of  less than 10�6 meters (about 1⁄40,000 of an inch), the resulting waves ought to be  visible as light
Lodge even proposed possible ways to produce such rapid os - cillations, including using the discharge of a small condenser or Leyden jar
But FitzGerald quickly threw cold water on his friends idea, citing passages  from Maxwells Treatise that showed, he said, that the energy of an electric cir- cuit could never be radiated away in waves like those of light
Maxwell be  lieved  light to be waves in the electromagnetic medium, but he thought the waves  were generated by an unknown molecular process rather than by elec trical  forces
He seems never to have considered that it might be possible to pro duce  and detect electromagnetic waves longer than those of light—and so missed  out on predicting the “radio waves” that in retrospect rank as the most distinc- tive and technologically important implication of his theory
Discouraged by FitzGeralds negative verdict, Lodge dropped the idea of  producing “electromagnetic light” and turned his attention elsewhere
In 1882, however, FitzGerald found he had blundered
On closer examination it turned  out that Maxwells strictures against the possibility of a circuit radiating away  its energy were based on an approximation that ignored the effect of displace- ment currents
Once he took these into account, FitzGerald found that al - most any oscillating current would generate electromagnetic waves
Although  he could see no practical way to achieve frequencies high enough to generate  Lodges visible light, FitzGerald was able to show that the discharge of a small  condenser would produce waves a few meters long, and even managed to cal- culate how much energy they would carry away
He could not devise a way to  detect these waves of invisible “light,” however, and they remained tantaliz- ingly out of reach for several more years
In the meantime, electromagnetic waves were taken up in a very different  context by Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925)
To call Heaviside eccentric would  be an understatement; his best friend of his later years once described him as  “a fi rst rate oddity,” though “never a mental invalid
”¹² Personal quirks aside,  Heaviside made enormous contri bu tions to Maxwellian theory, particularly  its application to telegraphic problems
The son of a London artisan, he left 12

school when he was 16 and was almost entirely self-taught in science and math- ematics
He had the good fortune, however, to have Charles Wheatstone as an  uncle and through him landed a job working on a telegraph cable that had  been laid across the North Sea in 1868
He soon became fascinated by electrical  phenomena and, after reading all he could fi nd on the subject, began publish- ing his own analyses of telegraphic problems
Heavisides caustic wit and prickly self-regard made him an amusing writer  but a difficult coworker
Confl icts on the job, together with ill health and a  de  sire to devote more of his time to his electrical studies, led him to “retire”  from the cable company when he was just 24
He spent the next 20 years living  with his parents, fi rst in London and later in Devonshire, and never again held  a regular job
It was a pinched and difficult life, but Heaviside was sustained  by the sense that he was making fundamental discoveries—as indeed he was
Heavisides fi rst important work was a revision of Thomsons 1854 theory  of cable signaling
Thomson had shown that the resistance of a cable and its  capacity to store charge combine to make signals diffuse along the line like  heat passing along a rod
It was a useful theory as far as it went, but in the 1870s Heaviside showed that if we also take into account “self-induction,” a sort of  electromagnetic inertia that opposes any sudden changes in the current, we  fi nd that the current does not simply diffuse along the cable but instead surges Maxwells Equations  in Heavisides Vector Form Oliver Heaviside hit on this simple sym- metrical form of Maxwells equations in  1885
The vector operations “div” and  “curl” capture how the strength and direc- tion of fi elds vary in space, while �/�t cap- tures how they vary with time
These equa- tions show how the electric fi eld strength  (E) and the magnetic fi eld strength (H) are related to each other when there are no  charges or currents in the neighborhood;  introducing such charges and currents adds  additional terms to the equations
Notice  that, except for a minus sign and the con- stants   and  , we can switch the places of  E and H in all of these equations, giving  them a powerful symmetry
Heavisides  form of Maxwells equations became stan- dard in the 1890s and, with small varia- tions, is the form still used today
div  E � 0 curl H �   �E �t �curl E �   �H �t div  H �
back and forth in a series of waves
To understand such waves more fully, and  to carry his analysis outside the wire into the surrounding dielectric, Heaviside  turned to Maxwells (1)(2)
Working alone in his room, Heaviside read Maxwells book with a probing  intensity that few could match
Early on, he began to strip away what he saw  as unnecessary mathematical baggage, paring down the often clumsy array of  symbols in which Maxwell had dressed his equations and devising a simple  vector algebra that scientists and engineers still use today
He also began to  ex  plore the physical workings of Maxwells fi eld, particularly the distribution  of energy
Maxwell had given formulas that specifi ed how energy is stored in  the space around currents and charges but had said little about how this energy  gets from one place to another
Heaviside focused on precisely this question,  for he regarded the clean transmission of energy along a wire—the energy  needed to trip a lever or defl ect a needle—as the key to effective telegraphy
His big breakthrough came in 1884
After laboriously manipulating Maxwells  original formulas, he hit on a remarkably simple result: the fl ow of energy at  any point in the fi eld is simply the vector product of the electric and magnetic  forces at that point: S � E � (1) This led to some surprising results, in par- ticular, that the energy conveyed by an electric current does not fl ow along  within the wire, as everyone had always assumed, but instead passes through  the surrounding space and converges on the wire, where it is converted into  heat or work
This might seem odd to those who pictured electric power fl ow- ing in a wire like water in a pipe, but in the context of Maxwellian theory it  made perfect sense, for it put the real action out in the fi eld rather than in the  currents and charges themselves
Heaviside thought a result as fundamental as his energy fl ow formula ought  to follow directly from the basic equations of electromagnetism, and he pro- ceeded to recast Maxwells theory so that it would
Working backwards, he  derived the set of four vector equations now universally known as “Maxwells  equations”—formally equivalent to Maxwells own set of equations based on  the vector potential, but simpler, more symmetrical, and, as Heaviside in - sisted, far more closely related to the physical state of the fi eld
He published  these equations in a series of articles in The Electrician, a weekly electrical trade  journal, early in 1885 and used them as the foundation on which to rebuild  Maxwells theory in a clearer and more usable form
Heaviside did not know it, but a Cambridge-trained physicist, (1) (1) Poynt- ing (1852–1914), had hit on the energy fl ow formula a few months before him,  which is why it is now known as Poyntings theorem rather than Heavisides
But while Poynting used the formula to clarify some important points in Max- wells theory, it did not lead him, like Heaviside, to recast the basic equations
Poynting saw the fl ow formula as a pretty mathematical theorem that offered  some useful physical insights; Heaviside, saturated as he was in problems of  telegraphic propagation, saw it as the key to understanding electromagnetic  theory as a whole
Heavisides recasting of Maxwells theory initially attracted little attention,  perhaps in part because it fi rst appeared in the pages of a trade journal, squeezed  between business notices and advertisements for wires and insulators
Heavi- side was a complete outsider, and it was all too easy for more established sci- entists and engineers to dismiss him as a crank
Consider his views on self- induction
Telegraphers had long regarded it as an obstacle to clear signaling  and tried to eliminate it whenever they could, yet in 1887 Heaviside said his  theories showed that the best way to improve signaling on telegraph and tele- phone lines was to increase their self-induction
(1)  (1) Preece, the chief engi- neer of the British Post Office telegraph department, denounced this as non- sense and took steps to block Heaviside from publishing further
Already  marginalized, Heaviside might have been silenced altogether had it not been  for two unexpected experimental developments: Lodges discovery of electro- magnetic waves along wires and Hertzs even more spectacular discovery of  electromagnetic waves in air
Lodges discovery grew out of experiments on lightning protection he per- formed early in 1888 in which he simulated lightning strikes by discharging  Leyden jars into long wires
He soon noticed some odd resonance phenomena  and realized that the oscillatory discharge of his jars was sending electromag- netic waves skittering down the wires
By letting the waves refl ect from the  far end and set up interference patterns, he was able to measure their wave- lengths and other properties
As a confi rmed Maxwellian, Lodge looked on  the waves as primarily fi eld phenomena, with the wires serving solely to guide  and concentrate them
When he set out to analyze the behavior of the waves,  Lodge found exactly the theoretical tools he needed in Heavisides writings,  and in March 1888 he publicly praised what he called Heavisides “masterly  grasp” of Maxwells theory
¹³ Heaviside was grateful fi nally to have a scien- tifi c ally, and he and Lodge soon struck up a lively and mutually supportive   correspondence
Lodge headed into the summer of 1888 thinking his discovery of waves on  wires would be the hit of the upcoming British Association meeting, but he 13

was soon upstaged by news out of (1)(2) Heinrich Hertz (1857–94) had  been the top student in Helmholtzs Berlin laboratory, excelling as both a  theorist and an experimenter
In the early 1880s he set out to fi nd an experi- mental test to decide among Webers, Neumanns, and Maxwells electrical  theories
He made little headway until 1886, when he took up a new job at an  engineering school, the Technische Hochschule in (1)(2) While trying out  some equipment, he noticed unexpected sparking when he discharged one coil Hertzs Electromagnetic  Wave Apparatus In 1888, the German physicist Heinrich  Hertz used the apparatus shown here to  produce and detect electromagnetic waves
He connected an induction coil ( J ) to two  metal sheets (A and A�) that were separated  by a small gap
The induction coil charged  the metal sheets until the voltage between  them became high enough to make a spark  jump across the gap; the electric fi eld  around the sheets then collapsed, sending  the outlying parts of the fi eld fl ying off as  electromagnetic waves
Hertz used hand- held wire loops (B and C ) with small spark  gaps to detect these waves
As the waves  struck the loops, they induced electric cur- rents that oscillated back and forth; if the  resonant frequency of the loop matched  that of the waves, the oscillations would  build up until they made tiny sparks jump the gap in the loop
By moving a loop back  and forth and squinting at sparks that were  barely visible in a darkened room, Hertz  was able to detect and measure the stand- ing wave patterns that were set up when he  bounced electromagnetic waves off a wall  or when, as shown here, he sent waves  both through the air and along a wire he  had connected to the metal sheets
Hertzs experiments were hailed as  strong confi rmation of Maxwells theory  and soon led to the wide acceptance of  fi eld theory in (1)(2) His work also  provided the starting point from which  Oliver Lodge, Guglielmo Marconi, and  others later developed wireless telegraphy  and other forms of radio communications

of wire near another
Following this up, by late 1887 he had produced evidence  of electromagnetic waves traveling along wires, and by March 1888 he was  sending waves several meters long fl ying through the air and bouncing them  off the walls of his lecture hall
Hertzs key step was to achieve resonance be - tween the source of his waves, essentially an opened-up condenser, and his  detector, a loop of wire with a small adjustable gap
When waves of the right  frequency struck the detector, tiny sparks, barely visible in a darkened room,  would jump across the gap, enabling Hertz to trace the interference patterns  set up by the waves refl ected from his walls
In later terms, he was “tuning” his  receiver to the frequency of his waves, about 50 million cycles per second or,  as we would now say, 50 megahertz
There were some ambiguities in Hertzs early results, and he only gradually  came to see them as fully confi rming Maxwells theory
The British Max- wellians showed no such hesitation, and at the September 1888 meeting of the  British Association in Bath, FitzGerald made a point of hailing Hertzs experi- ments as the long-sought proof that electromagnetic waves really exist
Though  he was disappointed to see his own experiments overshadowed, Lodge soon  joined in the chorus of praise for Hertzs work, and “Hertzian waves” fi gured  prominently in the discussions of self-induction, lightning conductors, and  electromagnetic propagation that made the Bath meeting a watershed in the  fortunes of Maxwellian theory and the Maxwellian group
Heaviside was not at Bath—he never attended scientifi c meetings—but his  name came up frequently there and the meeting helped spark his transforma- tion from obscure crank to recognized scientifi c authority
He began to cor- respond with FitzGerald and Hertz, as well as Lodge; his work began to draw  favorable notices in scientifi c journals; and in January 1889 Thomson devoted  much of his presidential address to the Institution of Electrical Engineers (for- merly the Society of Telegraph Engineers) to praise for Heavisides theory of  signal propagation
Over the next few years, Heavisides electri cal writings  were collected and published in two fat volumes, he was elected a Fellow of the  Royal Society of London, and his version of “Maxwells equations” began to  take its place in textbooks as the standard way of expressing the theory
His  proposal to improve the clarity of telegraph and telephone signals by loading  lines with extra self-induction was taken up in the late 1890s and made a for- tune for AT&T and other cor porations, though Heaviside, who had not pat- ented the idea, never made a penny from it
Heaviside continued to hold a grudge against Preece and other “practi- cians” who had earlier opposed him, but after 1888 he could afford to make  light of their resistance to the idea that scientifi c theory could ever have any- thing useful to contribute to engineering practice
Reports of the discussions  at the Bath meeting even inspired Heaviside to burst into verse, in a pointed  jab at Preece: Self inductions “in the air,”  Everywhere, everywhere; Waves are running to and fro,  Here they are, there they go
Try to stop em if you can  You British Engineering man
¹⁴ Electromagnetic waves were very much “in the air” after 1888, and Hertzs  experiments were soon repeated and extended by Lodge and others in Britain,  Germany, the United States, and other countries around the world
Most of  the scientists who performed these experiments were intent on exploring the  properties of the waves and demonstrating their similarities to light by show- ing, for example, that they could be refl ected, refracted, and polarized
The  scientists gave little thought to using the waves to send signals, but in the mid- 1890s a young Italian, Guglielmo Marconi (1874–1937), set out to do just that
Starting with apparatus similar to Lodges and tinkering with it to fi nd what  worked best, Marconi did experiments on his fathers estate in which he man- aged to send and receive wireless signals over ranges of up to a mile
In 1896 he  headed to London in hopes of attracting investors and tapping a potential  market for ship-to-shore communications
Aided by others with more scien- tifi c expertise, particularly (1) (1) Fleming (1849–1945), a professor of electrical  engineering who had studied under Maxwell, Marconi pushed his system for- ward rapidly, adapting it both for shipboard use and for long distance—even- tually transatlantic—point-to-point wireless telegraphy
By the 1910s, new  transmitters and receivers based on vacuum tubes made it possible to send and  receive audible speech, and the rapid development of radio broadcasting in the  1920s transformed mass communications in ways that Marconi, not to men- tion Hertz or Maxwell, could scarcely have imagined
Electromagnetic waves  soon became central to some of the most revolutionary technologies of the  twentieth century
On the surface, the story of the prediction, detection, and commercial use  of electromagnetic waves might look like a straightforward example of pure  science leading to technological applications, in a sequence running from Max- 14

well and Hertz to Marconi and the fi rst broadcasters
As we have seen, how- ever, the development of Maxwellian theory and the discovery of electro- magnetic waves were in fact the products of a complex interplay between  sci ence and technology, with important infl uences running both ways
Fara- days fi eld theory did not attract much real attention or support until telegra- phers took it up by in the 1850s, while Thomson, Maxwell, and Heaviside were  only the most prominent of the later electrical theorists whose work was  shaped by demands and opportunities arising from the growth of the British  cable  industry
Maxwell was well aware of how deeply telegraphy had infl uenced the de - velopment of electrical science
In the preface to his Treatise on Electricity and  Magnetism, he remarked: The important applications of electromagnetism to telegraphy have >>>>>> reacted on  pure science by giving a commercial value to accurate electrical measurements, and  by affording to electricians the use of apparatus on a scale which greatly transcends  that of any ordinary laboratory
The consequences of this demand for electrical  knowledge, and of these experimental opportunities for acquiring it, have been  already very great, both in stimulating the energies of advanced electricians, and in  diffusing among practical men a degree of accurate knowledge which is likely to  conduce to the general scientifi c progress of the whole engineering profession
¹⁵ The rise of fi eld theory in the nineteenth century was closely tied to the  rise of electrical technology, particularly cable telegraphy
As new technologies  exposed scientists to phenomena they would never have encountered in the  laboratory—the retardation of signals on long telegraph cables being the most  notable example—they stimulated research that led on the one hand to deeper  scientifi c insights and on the other to improved technologies
Electrical science  and technology fed each other in a mutually reinforcing cycle that expanded  the scale on which work on electricity was pursued, drove it forward into new  areas, and shaped the directions in which it developed
As Maxwell noted, the  rise of the telegraph industry had already sparked an enormous growth in the  demand for electrical knowledge in the 1860s and 1870s
That demand would  grow even more in the 1880s and 1890s, with consequences that would reach  into every corner of both physics and technology, as a new and even larger  industry emerged: electrical power and light

For most of us, stepping into a room and switching on a light is such an every- day experience that we hardly give it a thought
We expect to be able to draw  on abundant supplies of electric power virtually at will, and we take the vast  network of power plants and transmission lines that makes this possible almost  for granted—until it fails and we are suddenly plunged into a blackout
If most  of us give little thought to the sources of the power we use or the paths by  which it reaches us, we give even less to the long process, both scientifi c and  technological, by which the modern electric power system came to be
Beyond  a vague sense that Thomas Edison had something to do with it, most of us are  in the dark

Besides evoking the traditional link between light  and thought, the image harks back to Edisons most famous invention
But the  light bulb was not just a bright idea, and in any case it was only the shining tip  of the much larger power system that lay behind it
That system, partly the  work of Edison himself and partly that of many others, brought together the  two great branches of nineteenth-century physics: energy and electricity
It  provided striking examples of both the transformation of energy and the work- ings of the electromagnetic fi eld, and it called for an unprecedentedly high  level of scientifi c training on the part of the engineers who designed and ran  it
As the new electric power system began to transform daily life in the last  decades of the nineteenth century, it also set in train important changes in the  practice of engineering—changes that also affected the scale and direction of  work in physics
Beginnings The roots of the electric power and light industry stretch back to the 1830s, when the discovery of electromagnetic induction and the invention of the fi rst  electric motors led to a burst of electrical enthusiasm
Inventors from (1)(2)
Petersburg to New York demonstrated electrically propelled boats and car- riages to crowds of eager onlookers and boasted that railway trains, themselves  still quite new, would soon be driven by electricity rather than steam
Early  experiments suggested that there might be no limit to the power a properly  designed motor could draw from an ordinary battery, and by the late 1830s the prospect of replacing coal with clean and cheap electricity seemed almost  within reach
As we saw in Chapter 2, however, those hopes began to falter  after James Joule subjected them to careful experimental test in the early 1840s
Joule showed that there were defi nite limits to the amount of work any battery  could produce and concluded that, except for a few special purposes, it would  not pay to generate power by burning zinc rather than coal
Even as hopes for a battery-powered utopia were fading, however, new  sources of electrical power were opening up
Building on Michael Faradays  1831 discovery of electromagnetic induction, experimenters found they could  produce electric currents without batteries simply by spinning a coil of wire  between the poles of a magnet
In their simplest form, such magneto genera- tors produced alternating currents that sloshed back and forth as the coils cut  the magnetic lines of force fi rst in one direction and then in the other
Using  clever arrangements of brushes and commutators, inventors found ways to  draw off currents that fl owed in a single direction, though early magnetos still  produced something more like a succession of electrical jolts than a truly con- stant direct current
In laboratories and lecture halls, experimenters used hand- cranked magnetos to produce spectacular sparks and shocks, and by 1850 in - dustrialists were using big steam-driven magnetos to generate currents for use  in electroplating, passing strong currents through special chemical solutions in  order to deposit thin layers of gold, silver, or tin on the surfaces of objects  made of iron or other metals
Useful as magnetos were, their reliance on inherently weak permanent mag- nets put fundamental limits on their power and efficiency
In the early 1860s several inventors toyed with the idea of replacing the permanent magnets with  more powerful electromagnets, and in 1867 Werner von Siemens, Charles  Wheatstone, and (1) (1) Varley all nearly simultaneously devised what became  known as the “self-exciting dynamo-electric generator,” or “dynamo” for short
The basic principle was simple
Start with a regular magneto, crank it into  action, and then feed some of the resulting current into coils of wire wrapped  around the fi eld magnets
The added current will turn the permanent mag- nets into much stronger electromagnets, and dynamo makers soon found they  hardly needed the permanent magnets at all: the residual magnetism of ordi- nary iron was enough to get the process started
As the generator puts out more  current and its electromagnets grow stronger, each turn of the crank will pro- duce even more current
A dynamo will not, of course, give you something for  nothing: as the currents and electromagnets grow stronger, the crank will  become harder to turn and you will have to do more work to keep it going
In  return, however, the dynamo will be able to put out far more current than an  ordinary magneto ever could
Dynamos made it possible for the fi rst time to  convert mechanical work into electrical power on a really large scale
After 1867, inventors brought out a wide variety of new dynamo designs
Perhaps the most important improvement came in 1870, when a Belgian in  ven-   tor, Zénobe-Théophile Gramme, devised a dynamo with many interconnected  coils set around an iron ring
In place of the intermittent jolts produced by  earlier generators, Grammes dynamo generated a steady direct current that was  well suited to powering motors
In fact, if you fed current from one Gramme  dynamo down a wire and into a second one, the second dynamo would run  backwards as a motor
This gave a striking illustration of the conversion of en - ergy from mechanical to electrical form and back again, and also a hint of the  future electrical transmission of industrial power
The advent of improved dynamos like Grammes sparked a new burst of  electrical enthusiasm, and by the mid-1870s proponents were again en vision- ing a world powered by electricity—and lit by it as well
As early as 1802, Humphry Davy had found that when he ran a current from a large battery  through two carbon rods and then drew the rods slightly apart, the current  continued to fl ow in a sustained spark or arc that gave off an extremely bright  light
By the 1840s, arcs powered by huge batteries were being used to produce  spectacular lighting effects at the Paris Opera and in London theatres, and by  the late 1850s the fi rst magneto-powered arc lights were being used in light- houses
Current from batteries or magnetos was too expensive for most ordi- nary uses, however, and it was not until the development of more efficient dy  namos like Grammes that arc lighting became a practical alternative to gas  or oil lamps
By the late 1870s arc lights were being used to light streets and  large buildings in cities around the world, and the future of electric lighting  seemed dazzling
But that was just the problem: arc lights were too blindingly  bright to use in any ordinary room
Nor could one simply make a small arc  light, for if the current fell below a certain level, the arc went out altogether
There were great hopes for electric lighting in the late 1870s, but the way for- ward was far from clear
Edisons System When Thomas Edison (1847–1931) took up the problem of electric lighting in  1878, he thought he was just the man to solve it—and in many ways he was  right
Though only 31, he was already known as Americas top inventor, famous  for a string of important telegraph and telephone devices and especially for the  astonishing “talking machine,” or phonograph, he had devised the year before
Backed by Western Union, the giant telegraph fi rm, he had recently opened  an “invention factory” at Menlo Park, New Jersey, declaring that he and his  team of assistants would turn out “a minor invention every ten days and a big  thing every six months or so
”¹ Brash, affable, and a skilled self-promoter,  Edison knew how to give his friends in the press stories that would sell papers
They rewarded him with reams of free publicity and an evocative title: “the  Wizard of Menlo (1)(2)” Lighting was, of course, already a big business long before Edison took it  up
Gas lighting systems had fi rst appeared around 1800, and over the next few  decades pipes began to snake their way beneath the streets of most European  and American cities, supplying homes and businesses with “town gas” pro- duced by heating coal in huge central gasworks
Gas was more convenient to  use than old-fashioned lamps and candles, but it had serious drawbacks, par- ticularly the heat, soot, and fumes the fl aming gas gave off and the danger of  asphyxiation or explosions from leaking pipes
Edison came to electric lighting armed with his characteristic drive and  confi dence but lacking much experience with dynamos or the strong currents  required for lighting
Early in September 1878 he visited the workshops of   William Wallace, a Connecticut maker of dynamos and arc lights
Edison was  intrigued by what he saw and came away with a sweeping vision of a system  that would supply both power and light from central generating stations
He  would, he said, unite steam engines, dynamos, wires, and motors into one great  electromechanical system
To make it work, however, he would need one more  crucial ingredient: a small and readily controllable electric lamp, comparable  to a gas light
Convinced that arc lights would not do, Edison thought the  most promising alternative was the incandescent lamp, in which an electric  current heats a coil of wire or other “burner” until it glows white hot
Several  other inventors were already working on incandescent lamps, though so far  without much success, and after his visit to Wallace, Edison told reporters he 1
Matthew Josephson, Edison: A Biography (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1959), pp(1)–34
was happy to see “the thing had not gone so far but that I had a chance
”² Not  long after returning to Menlo Park, he hit upon what he felt sure was the per- fect answer
He assured reporters that he would have it all worked out within  a few weeks
Edisons initial optimism was based on the platinum regulator lamp
Plat- inum was one of the few materials that could be heated to incandescence  without burning up, but the trick was to get it hot enough to glow without  letting it melt
Edison thought he saw a way—in fact, dozens of ways—to add  a tiny thermostat that would momentarily shut off the current just before the  white-hot fi lament could melt
Once the fi lament had cooled a little, the cur- rent would switch back on, reheating the fi lament and restoring its glow
This  would all happen so quickly, Edison said, that the lamp would not even fl icker
He lined up investors and in October 1878 launched the Edison Electric Light  Company to fi nance further development
Lighting by gas, he declared, would  soon be a thing of the past—a boast that quickly sent gas company stocks  tumbling
It soon became clear, however, that Edison would need more than  a few weeks to make his new system work
Edison was not a scientist, but he knew how to draw on scientifi c data and  expertise when he needed them
He maintained a large scientifi c library at  Menlo Park, and in December 1878 he hired Francis Upton (1852–1921), a  young American physicist who had studied under Helmholtz in (1)(2) Upton  did important calculations on the lamp, dynamo, and wiring systems, bring- ing scientifi c knowledge and methods to bear on Edisons design ideas
Edison  was remarkably creative, but what really set him apart from other inventors  was his access to resources and manpower
At Menlo Park, he was able to call  not only on Upton, but on a crew of skilled machinists who could quickly turn  his rough sketches into working models
Edison had a million ideas, and he  also had the means to try them out virtually on the spot
Edison kept working on the platinum regulator lamp though the winter of  1878–79, confi dent he was on the right track
He invited investors and report- ers to Menlo Park to see his glowing lamps, but the demonstrations, though  impressive, were strictly temporary: the platinum fi laments inevitably failed  after just a few hours
Enclosing the fi lament in an evacuated glass bulb helped,  and Edisons men soon developed the best vacuum pumps in the world, but  work on the platinum lamp itself began to stall out
Edison had been at it for 2

nearly a year, and by September 1879 both his investors and the public were  growing restive
Edison had staked his reputation on delivering a working electric light,  and if platinum would not do the job, he would try something else—prefera- bly something cheaper
Carbon was fragile, but it was cheap and it could be  made to incandesce in a vacuum, so Edison and his assistants gave it a try
In  October 1879 they took a simple cotton thread, baked it in an oven to reduce  it to a skeleton of pure carbon, clamped it to two electrical leads, and sealed it  in an evacuated bulb
When they turned on the current, the new bulb glowed  beautifully for more than 14 hours
Elated, Edison quickly patented the carbon  fi lament bulb, and within a few months his crew was turning out lamps with  fi laments of carbonized bamboo that could stay lit for hundreds of hours
By  later standards the bulbs were dim and woefully inefficient, drawing over 100 watts of power to produce no more light than a modern 25-watt incandescent  bulb or a 4-watt compact fl uorescent
To Edison and his contemporaries, how- ever, the new bulb was a shining marvel
No light bulb was much good, however, without something to plug it into
From the fi rst, Edison had set his sights on building a unifi ed system to deliver  electric power and light, but it took some time for him to grasp just how com- plex the task of integrating the necessary generators, lamps, and wiring would  be
He modeled his plans closely on the gas system, with a centralized supply  and individually controlled lamps
As fi rst he even proposed running his wires  through disused gas pipes and installing electric lamps in existing gas fi xtures— ideas he soon gave up, though he stuck with running his transmission lines  underground
Matching the fl exibility of gas, while beating it on safety, cost,  and convenience, always remained his goal
A key insight shaped Edisons entire system: the lamps, he said, should be  arranged in parallel circuits rather than in series, as arc lights generally were
With lamps arranged in parallel, like the rungs of a ladder, he could connect  many lamps to a single generator while still allowing each lamp to be indi- vidually controlled; with a series circuit, in which the current passed directly  from one lamp to the next, if a single lamp went out, they all did
To make a  parallel system work, the individual lamps needed to be of high resistance, on  the order of 100 ohms—a requirement Edisons thin carbon fi laments met  nicely
Low-resistance incandescent lamps like those developed by Edisons  competitors, notably Joseph Swan in England, would have drawn enormous  currents if arranged in parallel and would have required thick and expensive  copper conductors to carry the load without suffering huge losses in transmis- sion
Edison made high-resistance lamps arranged in parallel circuits the foun- dation of his system and proceeded to design everything else around them
Edison always used direct current, regarding it as simpler, safer, and more  efficient than alternating current
In addition, the electric motors available at  the time worked only on direct current, and Edison saw such “motor loads” as  a crucial part of his integrated system to supply both power and light—and as  the main market for current during daylight hours, when few lights would be  turned on
For safety, especially with underground conductors, he had to keep  the voltage on the transmission lines relatively low, and he soon settled on 110 volts, a level that also worked well with his bulbs
This meant, however, that  one of his central stations could serve customers only within a radius of about  a mile; too much power would be lost in transmission at low voltages to be  able to supply current to more distant customers and still turn a profi t
Given the limited range of his direct current system, Edison needed to  locate his power plants in areas with a high density of potential customers
That, combined with his desire to make an impression on investors, led him  to pick lower Manhattan for his fi rst installation, and in May 1881 he acquired  a site on Pearl Street, just a few blocks from Wall (1)(2) It took his crew  months to install his special “Jumbo” dynamos and the big steam engines that  would drive them, and months more to lay the underground transmission  lines and wire up customers offices
Finally, on 4 September 1882, the crew at  Pearl Street fi red up its fi rst engine, set its fi rst dynamo spinning, and sent cur- rent coursing through the system
Edison was fi nally lighting up New York  City—or at least a small corner of it
The Pearl Street station worked well, though it took several years for it to  turn a profi t
Edison ran it as a commercial operation, but it was essentially a  demonstration project, intended mainly to test and show off the new system
The limited range of Edisons direct current system made it difficult for him  to expand much beyond the initial service area
Over the next few years Edi- sons companies built similar power stations in several other cities and installed  a large number of “isolated plants” in factories, hotels, and other businesses
Before the vision of giant integrated power systems could become a reality,  however, electrical technology would need to take a step in a new and different  direction
AC versus DC The 1880s and 1890s witnessed what became known as the “War of the Cur- rents” or “Battle of the Systems,” as Edisons direct current (DC) system was  challenged by the upstart alternating current (AC) system
It was a long and bitter struggle, fought out mainly in the United States but with skirmishes  elsewhere, and it came to involve everything from the fi rst electric chair to the  harnessing of Niagara (1)(2) The eventual victory of the more complex but  fl exible AC system had important consequences not just for the shape and  workings of the electric power system, but for the whole profession of electri- cal engineering, and indirectly for physics as well
The main problem with Edisons DC system stemmed from the basic rela- tionship between voltage, current, and power
The power (measured in watts)  that any current can deliver is given by the strength of the current (measured Testing a Dynamo  in Thomas Edisons Workshop Thomas Edison is remembered as the  inventor of the light bulb, but even the  best bulb would have been useless without  something to plug it into
Besides the bulb  itself, Edison and his crew at Menlo Park  devised a system to generate, distribute,  and control electric power and, perhaps  just as importantly, an “invention factory”  to produce it all
Drawing on Faradays  ideas about the fl ow of magnetic force,  Edison developed a new form of dynamo,  known as the “long-legged Mary-Ann” because of its unusually long fi eld magnets;  here, we see one being tested at the Menlo  Park workshop in 1879 as Edisons friend  George Barker, physics professor at the  University of Pennsylvania, looks on
Edisons dynamos worked well enough, but  his understanding of the underlying theory  proved faulty; it turned out there was no  real need for the magnets to be so long,  and they were soon replaced by shorter  ones

in amperes) multiplied by its potential or voltage (measured in volts)
In sym- bols, taking P for power, I for current, and V for voltage, we have P � I • (1) We can thus deliver, say, 1000 watts of power with a high voltage and a weak  current (1000 volts and 1 amp), or a low voltage and a strong current (1 volt  and 1000 amps), or any other combination of volts and amps whose product  is 1000
As the current passes along the transmission line, however, some of its  power is lost to resistance, going simply to heat up the wire
Joule had shown  in 1840 that such losses were proportional to the resistance (R ) of the wire  multiplied by the square of the current passing through it: P � I 2 • (1)
There are several ways to minimize transmission losses in DC systems
First, we can keep the resistance low by using thick (and expensive) copper  conductors
Alternatively, we can hold down the total resistance by keeping  the transmission wires short and serving only customers who are located near  the power plant, as Edison had done at his Pearl Street station
A third option  would be to raise the voltage and reduce the current
If we were to increase the  voltage by a factor of 10, we could deliver the same power with one-tenth the  current, and since the power goes by the square of the current, losses in trans- mission would drop by a factor of 100
If Edison had run his system at 1100 volts instead of 110, he could have reduced the power lost in transmission by  99 percent and so could have served a far wider area with the same amount of  copper
Of course, Edison had found it hard enough to insulate his underground  conductors when they were carrying 110 volts; insulating 1100-volt wires would  have been far trickier
Nor could his carbon fi lament bulbs have stood up to  such high voltages for long
More to the point, who would want a 1100 volt  power line coming directly into his or her home
Most people regarded such  high voltages as simply too dangerous for home use
It would be best, of course, if one could fi nd a way to transmit power at a  high voltage and then bring it into the home at a low voltage
Clever wiring  arrangements enabled Edison to go a little way in that direction in the mid- 1880s, extending his radius of service from one mile to about two and quad- rupling the area each power station could serve
But there seemed to be no  practical way to go much further
Given his commitment to DC, Edison seemed  to be stuck with his model of low voltages, small service areas, and numerous  small power plants
There was, of course, an alternative to direct current
In the late 1870s, al - ternating current was already widely used for arc lighting, since it made the  carbon rods burn down more evenly than did direct current
Alternating cur- rent also worked well with incandescent lamps; currents sloshing rapidly back and forth heated fi laments to a white glow just as effectively as a steady current  did
By the early 1880s, overhead AC power lines, many carrying thousands of  volts, were going up in cities around the world
In Britain, the Electric Lighting Act of 1882 stipulated that electric supply  companies could not force their customers to purchase any specifi c type of  light bulb
The aim was to promote competition and consumer choice in the  bulb industry, but the law also created a potential market for an adapter that  could adjust voltages to suit different kinds of bulbs
Lucien Gaulard (1850– 88), a French inventor working in London, responded by developing a device  whose eventual signifi cance extended far beyond its original purpose
The  “secondary generator” (or transformer, as it came to be called) that he patented  with John (1) Gibbs was a complex arrangement of coils and iron rods that a  customer could use to step an incoming AC voltage either up or down to  virtually any desired level
If your local electric company supplied alternating  current at 200 volts but your favorite lamps worked best at 60 volts, you could  simply change a few settings on your Gaulard-Gibbs transformer, wire it up,  and proceed to plug in your bulbs
The working principle of the transformer was based directly on Faradays  1831 discovery of electromagnetic induction
Oersted had shown that an elec- tric current produces a magnetic fi eld, and Faraday had shown that a changing  magnetic fi eld can generate an electric current
Thus, if we wrap two coils of  insulated wire around an iron ring and run an alternating current into the fi rst  coil, it will produce a changing magnetic fi eld in the ring, which will in turn  induce an alternating electric current in the second coil
No current actually  passes from the fi rst coil to the second, but power clearly does, showing in a  striking way that energy fl ows through the surrounding electromagnetic fi eld  rather than just within the conducting wires
The power that passes between  the coils is coupled through the changing magnetic fi eld, and by adjusting the  number of turns in each coil, we can step the voltage induced in the second  coil either up or down
Crucially, the process works only with alternating cur- rents; if we feed a steady direct current into the fi rst coil, it will just set up a  steady magnetic fi eld in the iron ring, and as Faraday had shown, such a steady  fi eld is powerless to induce an electric current
Gaulard and Gibbs demonstrated their new transformer in London in 1883 and in Italy the next year
By then, Gaulard recognized that it could be far  more than just an adapter for light bulbs: it might offer a way to solve the great  problem of electrical transmission
After generating alternating current at a  convenient voltage, one could use a transformer to step it up to thousands of  volts for efficient transmission
Closer to the customer, one could then use a second transformer to step the voltage back down to a level that was safe to  bring into the home
It seemed an almost perfect solution
Others soon picked up on Gaulards idea and developed it further
The  American industrialist George Westinghouse and his engineer William Stan- ley, a group of Hungarian engineers at Ganz and Company in Budapest, and  (1) (1) de Ferranti in London all found ways to simplify and improve Gaulards  original highly complex design and produce more efficient and reliable trans- formers
Ferranti and his backers even challenged Gaulard and Gibbss original  patent, claiming (rather misleadingly) that the device was not really new, and  in 1888 a British court threw the patent out
Gaulard, who had a history of  mental problems, found this too much to bear
Not long after, he reportedly  called at the Elysée Palace and demanded to speak to the president of France,  declaring, “I am God and God does not wait
”³ He died in a Paris asylum later  that year
By then AC systems based on improved versions of Gaulards transformer  were already coming into commercial use
The Ganz engineers in Hungary,  Ferranti in Britain, and Stanley in the United States had all demonstrated  working systems by mid-1886
Westinghouse proceeded to push the new tech- nology forward at breakneck speed, erecting his fi rst commercial AC power  plant just a few months after Stanleys successful demonstration
By 1888 the  Westinghouse Electric Company was building more electric power plants in  a month than Edison did in year, and other fi rms, notably the Thomson- Houston Company of Massachusetts, were also jumping into the booming  AC incandescent lighting business
It looked to many like Edisons DC system  might be left in the dust
The strong point of the AC system, of course, was its freedom from the  high transmission losses that plagued Edisons DC system
An AC power plant  could reach a far wider area than a DC plant and could thus be located with  an eye toward efficiency of production rather than proximity to customers
Alternating current still faced serious technical challenges, however, and as late  as 1888, it still lagged badly in a very important area: direct current could be  used to drive motors, while alternating current (with some minor exceptions)  could not
Without a workable motor, alternating current could never replace  direct current as the foundation of a unifi ed system to supply both power and  light

The AC industry faced another major obstacle in the late 1880s: opposition  from Edison and his backers
Edisons investors included some of the biggest  money men on Wall Street, and they did not like to see their stake in the DC  system devalued by an upstart competitor
Edison himself was understandably  partial to his own DC system and skeptical that alternating current could  really deliver all of the benefi ts its proponents claimed
He turned down all  op  portunities to get into the AC business himself, in part because he was con- vinced that high-voltage AC lines simply were not safe
“Just as sure as death,”  he wrote in 1886, “Westinghouse will kill a customer within 6 months after he  puts in a system of any size
”⁴ Early in 1888, the Edison Electric Light Com- pany issued a pamphlet bearing a red cover and a stark title: “A (1)(2)”  After laying out what it said were the legal, technical, and economic defi cien- cies of Westinghouses system, the pamphlet declared alternating current to be  inherently dangerous
It drove its message home by reprinting newspaper ac - counts of gruesome accidents involving high-voltage AC lines
At just that moment, a new fi gure stepped forward as a self-appointed  guardian of electrical safety
In June 1888 Harold (1) Brown, a little-known elec- trical consultant who had worked in the arc lighting business, sent the New  York Evening Post a letter in which he denounced alternating current as “dam- nable” and a serious hazard to the public
He called for a law limiting AC  power lines to no more than 300 volts, a measure that would have crippled the  AC industry by eliminating its chief advantage over direct current
Brown also  maintained that alternating current was deadlier than direct current even at  relatively low voltages, a claim he backed up by publicly subjecting dogs to  jolts fi rst of one kind of current and then the other
In the process Brown killed  a number of the unfortunate animals, and many of the onlookers expressed  their revulsion at his methods
The Edison interests were widely accused of  being behind Browns efforts and of using his distasteful demonstrations to  discredit alternating current
No direct pay-offs were ever proved, but Brown  was certainly given every assistance at Edisons new laboratory in West Orange,  New Jersey, where many of the animal-killing experiments were in fact fi rst  performed by Edisons staff
Killing dogs turned out to be just the start
In 1886, the state of New York  had set up a commission to investigate possible new methods of capital pun- ishment
Rejecting the noose as cruel and outdated, its members thought elec- tricity might offer a clean, modern, and humane alternative
When they fi rst 4
Josephson, Edison, p(1)
asked Edison for advice in November 1887, he declined to help, saying he  op posed the death penalty altogether
When pressed, however, he replied that  if the state insisted on executing people, then electricity would indeed be the  best way to do it
Evidently seeing a chance to get in a dig at his chief com- petitor, Edison added that an especially deadly source of current was readily  available: the AC dynamos “manufactured principally in this country by (1)(2)  (1)(2)”⁵ Swayed by Edisons endorsement, the New York legislature passed the Elec- trical Execution Act in June 1888
The law did not specify the type of current  to be used, but the board charged with working out procedures hired Brown  as its consultant, and he soon steered them toward high-voltage alternating  current—“the executioners current,” as he called it
He proceeded to design  an electric chair, complete with straps, mask, and electrodes, and set about ac - quiring AC dynamos for the state prisons
Brown insisted on using Westing- house machines, explicitly saying that he wished to bring the safety of West- inghouses system into disrepute and if possible secure a legal ban on the use  of high-voltage alternating current for anything but executions
Westinghouse  angrily refused to sell Brown any equipment, but with help from Edison, Brown  managed to buy Westinghouse dynamos on the secondhand market
The bitter fi ght spilled over even into what to call the new process of elec- trical execution
There were many suggestions, ranging from “electrothanasia”  and “dynamort” to “joltacuss” and “blitzentod
” Edisons lawyer suggested that,  just as the guillotine had been named for (1)(2) Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, so one  who had been killed with electricity might be said to have been “westinghoused
”⁶ The other side shot back that “browned” would be a more fi tting term
Even- tually everyone settled on “electrocuted
” The fi rst person to be executed with electricity was an axe-murderer from  Buffalo named William (1)(2) After the courts rejected the argument that  electrocution would be an unconstitutionally cruel or unusual form of punish- ment, he was duly strapped into the new electric chair at Auburn Prison on  6 August 1890
The fi rst jolt of current made Kemmlers body twitch and  stiffen, but to the horror of the assembled officials, it left him still breathing
As he groaned hideously, they applied a second and much longer jolt that cer- tainly killed him, but also seared his fl esh and singed his hair
The stench was  horrible; at least one reporter fainted
When Westinghouse read news ac - 5

counts of Kemmlers execution, he was disgusted
“It was a brutal affair,” he  said
“They could have done better with an axe
”⁷ Despite such efforts to tag it as the killer current and ban its use, alternat- ing current continued to capture an ever larger share of the electric lighting  market in the late 1880s and early 1890s
Its lower cost and ability to reach  wider areas evidently outweighed any safety concerns or unpleasant associa- tions with executions, and Westinghouse and Thomson-Houston built hun- dreds of new AC power plants in the United States and abroad
In Europe,  Ganz and Company and the German fi rm AEG installed AC systems in many  cities and began laying plans to transmit hydroelectric power over long dis- tances
They needed just one more piece to have a complete AC power system:  a workable motor
The key fi gure in the development of the AC motor was a visionary Ser- bian-born engineer, Nikola Tesla (1856–1943)
Trained in physics and engineer- ing at the Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, he acquired a grasp of mathematics and  electrical theory as well of the nuts and bolts of dynamo and motor design
He  was impressed by the way a Gramme dynamo could be made to run backwards  as a motor but saw its sparking brushes and commutator as a weak point
There must be a way to eliminate such troublesome components, he thought,  and make a motor that could run on the alternating current that a dynamo  with no commutator would produce
Tesla later said the idea for his revolu- tionary solution, an induction motor based on a rotating magnetic fi eld, came  to him in a fl ash of insight in 1882 while he was walking in a park in (1)(2)  It would be another fi ve years, however, before he would seek to patent his  idea
In the meantime, Tesla worked on DC systems, fi rst for one of Edisons  companies in Paris and then in 1884 for Edison himself in New (1)(2) Edison  was impressed with Teslas abilities but scoffed at his grand talk about the  wonders of alternating currents
Tesla quit in disgust and was reduced for a  time to working as a ditch digger
Finally in 1887 he lined up new backers,  wrote up his ideas, and applied for patents on his motor
Shortly after his patents were issued in May 1888, Tesla demonstrated his  new motor at a meeting of the American Institute of Electrical (1)(2) He  was a master showman, and the audience of elite electrical engineers and phys- icists was impressed
Teslas key idea was to take two alternating currents that  were a quarter cycle out of phase and feed them into two pairs of coils set  around a central rotor
As the current through each pair of coils rose and fell, 7

the resulting magnetic fi eld within the motor would wheel around the axis,  dragging the rotor with it
Teslas motor had no need for brushes or commu- tators, since it worked on induced alternating currents
When Westinghouse  heard of Teslas invention, he saw that the new motor provided just what he  needed to make his AC system complete
He quickly snapped up the rights to  Teslas patents for a handsome royalty
Others in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland were also working on induction  motors
In the early 1890s “polyphase” AC systems, some based on Teslas  original two currents, others using three, scored a series of impressive triumphs  in both Europe and (1)(2) The fi rst came in 1891, when engineers from Swiss  and German fi rms set up a high-voltage AC line to transmit over 100 kilowatts  of power 110 miles from a hydroelectric site on the Neckar River to the Frank- Lithograph of the Frankfurt  Electrical Exhibition (1891) The international electrical exhibition held  in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1891 marked a  milestone in the development of alternat- ing current power technology
The high- light of the exhibition, whose entrance is  depicted in this lithograph, was the trans- mission of AC power at high voltage over 110 miles from a hydroelectric plant at  Lauffen on the Neckar (1)(2) The power  was used not just to light lamps on the  exhibition grounds but also to pump water  for an impressive artifi cial waterfall, shown  on the right
� Elektrizität: Offizielle Zeitung der Inter- nationalen Ausstellung Frankfurt am Main,  1891, p(1)
furt Electrical (1)(2) Besides lighting the exhibits, the power drove a new  three-phase induction motor designed by AEG engineer Michael Dolivo- Dobrolowsky that was used to pump water for an artifi cial waterfall on the  exhibition grounds—a dramatic foretaste of what the long-distance transmis- sion of electric power might later achieve
In 1892, plans were being laid for the great Columbian Exposition to be  held in Chicago the next year
General Electric, newly formed by the merger  of Edisons company with Thomson-Houston, initially offered to provide the  fair with DC incandescent lighting for $1
million
When the fair managers  balked, Westinghouse stepped in and offered to do the job with alternating  current for just $400,000
He proceeded to install hundreds of thousands of  incandescent bulbs, as well as thousands of arc lights and dozens of Tesla in - duction motors, all powered by enormous AC dynamos
The Chicago fair held  the largest concentration of electrical technology ever seen up to that time, and  its 27 million visitors came away enthralled by the prospect of a future lit and  powered by electricity
Westinghouse made little if any profi t on the Chicago  contract, but the fair and its glittering “White City” provided better advertis- ing for his AC system than any he could have bought
Perhaps the greatest triumph for alternating current came at Niagara (1)(2)  In 1889, a group of New York fi nanciers formed a company to harness the  enormous power of the falls
Seeing no prospect of selling so much power at  Niagara itself, they looked for a way to transmit the bulk of it to the booming  city of Buffalo, some 20 miles away
The success of the Frankfurt demonstra- tion line encouraged them to use electricity, and after an extensive and well- publicized investigation, in May 1893 they settled on polyphase alternating  current as the best option
The Niagara verdict, refl ecting the considered judg- ment of those regarded as best informed on the subject, was widely seen as a  decisive victory for alternating current in the battle of the currents
Huge tunnels were dug and turbines installed, and in August 1895 the fi rst  of the giant Westinghouse dynamos whirred into action
They were soon turn- ing out far more power, at far lower cost, than any other power plant in the  world
The availability of so much cheap electric power created new and unan- ticipated industries, and to the surprise of those behind the project, all of the  power the Niagara plant initially produced—more than 10 megawatts—was  bought by new aluminum smelters and electrochemical works in its immedi- ate neighborhood
Ironically, most of these industrial customers needed direct  current for their processes, so the alternating current from the power plant had  to be run through rotary converters (essentially AC motors geared to DC dy - namos) to supply them
By 1896, however, substantial amounts of Niagara  power were being sent to Buffalo, and within a few years the falls were supply- ing AC electric power to much of New York State and (1)(2)
By the mid-1890s, direct current was clearly losing ground
The prospect  of such decline was one of the motives that had led Edisons fi nancial backers  to force his company to merge with Thomson-Houston in 1892 to form  Gen eral  (1)(2) Edison was eased out, and the new company was run by the Thom- son-Houston management, who went on to lead GE more fully into the AC  business in the later 1890s
Similar trends were seen in much of Europe as the  electrical industry consolidated into a relatively few large AC fi rms
Many  smaller DC fi rms went under—including (1) Einstein and Company of Munich,  a once-promising maker of dynamos and lighting equipment that was owned  and run by Albert Einsteins father and uncle
Direct current did not disappear overnight
There were still large DC sys- tems in place in New York and many other cities, and rather than ripping them  out and replacing them at enormous cost, most power companies left them in  service, using rotary converters to supply them with current from AC power  plants
From the 1890s to the 1930s, power companies used the same method  to supply the large market for DC power to drive electric streetcars; for all of  their virtues, AC induction motors were not well suited to the demands of  electric traction
One of the strengths of the AC system was its ability to supply  a wide range of loads, including direct current, at relatively low cost, and after  1900 the electric power industry moved increasingly toward the unifi ed system  that would prevail throughout the twentieth century: huge power plants,  long-distance transmission over high-voltage AC lines, and local distribution  at lower voltages through substations and transformers
It was an effective sys- tem, but one that entrenched patterns of large-scale production and consump- tion that would later raise serious environmental problems
Designing and running the AC power system and its array of associated  equipment proved to be an extremely demanding task
Engineers could no  longer treat electricity simply like water fl owing in a pipe, as they had often  done with direct current; to make AC systems work, they also had to take into  account complex inductive effects and fi eld interactions
Successful AC engi- neering required a grasp of electromagnetic theory and a level of mathematical  analysis that were beyond the reach of most of the older pioneers of direct cur- rent
In 1892, when one of his aides came to him with an electrical question,  Edison told him to take it to Arthur Kennelly, the chief electrical expert at the  West Orange laboratory and later a professor of electrical engineering at Har- vard and MI(1) When it came to electricity, Edison said, “he knows far more about it than I do
In fact,” he added, “Ive come to the conclusion that I never  did know anything about it
”⁸ Electrical Engineering and the Growth of Physics The growth of the electric power and light industry in the 1880s sparked a huge  rise in the demand for trained electrical engineers
Edison himself felt it keenly
“I need the men,” he told the New York Tribune in 1883
“My work is seriously  retarded by my inability to obtain competent engineers
”⁹ The later shift to  polyphase alternating current exacerbated the problem, as fi rms now needed  engineers trained to an even higher level
But where were such engineers to be  found
Traditionally, especially in Britain and the United States, engineers had  been trained largely through apprenticeship
After some initial schooling, a  student would go to an established engineer, pay a substantial “premium,” and  spend a few years learning the trade by working his way up through various  jobs in workshops and drawing offices
This worked well enough for civil and  mechanical engineering, which had long traditions and an ample supply of  master engineers, but it failed badly for those looking to go into electrical en - gineering
The electric power and light industry was so new, and its growth in  the 1880s so explosive, that there was essentially no pool of experienced electri- cal engineers to whom a student could apply
Without masters, there could be  no apprentices, and beyond a handful of self-taught inventors, electrical engi- neering was not something one could readily pick up on ones own
Many  areas of electrical engineering also required mathematical skills that appren- ticeship was ill-suited to convey
There were several potential alternatives to apprenticeship
Since the late  eighteenth century, France had developed a system of technical schools to   pre  pare civil and military engineers for government service, but these offered  little to those looking to go into the electric power and light industry
In Ger- many and central Europe, many of the polytechnical schools, or Technische  Hochschulen, provided excellent instruction in mechanical engineering, but  without a store of specifi cally electrical knowledge, few mechanical engineers  were equipped to train prospective electrical engineers
The same held true in  American engineering schools, which in any case were generally less advanced  than their German counterparts
Nor were telegraph engineers able to meet 8

the need; except in Britain, where the demands of cable telegraphy had pro- duced a higher level of electrical competence, few telegraphers proved able to  make the transition to power and light engineering
Frustrated by the lack of qualifi ed engineers, Edison and Thomson-Hous- ton set up their own in-house training programs in the early 1880s, followed  a little later by (1)(2) Such “test courses” did a good job of teaching  em  ployees how to install and operate their companies products, but they fell  far short of meeting the wider need for electrical engineers
Almost by default, the task of teaching electrical engineering initially fell  to physics professors
They alone possessed both the requisite electrical knowl- edge and the means to impart it to substantial numbers of students, and in the  early 1880s physicists at universities and technical colleges in Britain, Germany,  and the United States stepped forward to offer programs in “electrotechnol- ogy” or “applied electricity
” These programs often grew to dwarf the physics  departments from which they had sprung, and in the 1890s most split off to  become separate electrical engineering departments
The whole process gen- erally took little more than a decade, but the fact that electrical engineering  education often got its start within physics departments had important conse- quences for both disciplines
Physicists had been studying electricity in their laboratories for many years  before 1880, of course, but except in the British cable industry, there had been  little technological demand for the knowledge and skills physicists had to offer
Inventors had drawn on physicists discoveries, as we have seen, and physicists  had taken up technological problems ranging from the efficiency of steam en - gines to the retardation of telegraph signals
Few engineers in the mid-nine- teenth century, however, regarded advanced academic study in physics as the  best path to success in their profession
Some physicists (notably William  Thomson in Glasgow) made a pitch for the wider practical value of their work,  but most were content to pursue scientifi c knowledge for its own sake
Phys- ics—or “natural philosophy,” as it was often still called—occupied only a small  place in the usual college curriculum
Although many students were exposed  to a smattering of the subject in hopes it would give them an appreciation of  the wisdom of Gods laws, very few were moved to study it further
Shortly after Johns Hopkins University opened in 1876 as the fi rst real  research university in the United States, the physicist Henry Rowland (1848– 1901) explained why his department could never expect to attract many gradu- ate or “special” students
Advanced students in chemistry or biology could go  into business or medicine, he said, “but in physics special students have no  opening in life except as teachers, and as the demand for these is limited, so the number of special students must be
”¹⁰ Rowland wrote, however, at almost  the last moment that such a statement could be made
In the early 1880s, the  birth of the electric power and light industry set off a clamor for electrical ex - pertise that drew large numbers of students into physics classrooms and gave  the subject a more prominent place in the academic landscape
Britain got an early start on the process, as the rise of the submarine cable  industry had led Thomson and others to open the fi rst physics teaching labo- ratories in British colleges and universities in the 1850s and 1860s
The work in  these laboratories focused on precision electrical measurement, and while it  proved important for both physicists and cable engineers, it was pursued on a  relatively small scale
It provided a solid grounding in electrical principles,  however, and the laboratories established by Thomson and others helped lay  the basis for later work in power and light engineering
Electrical engineering education in Britain developed along a curious path  that led through (1)(2) In the 1870s, as part of a policy aimed at promoting  rapid technological development, the Japanese government began to import  European and American experts to serve as teachers
When Japanese officials asked Thomson for advice, he recommended a young Englishman, (1) (1) Ayr- ton (1847–1908), who had studied in Thomsons Glasgow laboratory and had  then spent several years as a telegraph engineer in (1)(2) Ayrton arrived in  Tokyo in 1873 with a fi ve-year contract to teach physics at the new Imperial  College of (1)(2) Given a free hand and eventually ample funding by  the Japanese, he established one of the worlds best courses in electrical physics  and telegraph engineering
After his contract ended in 1878, Ayrton returned  to London and put the ideas he had developed in Japan into practice at Fins- bury Technical College and, after 1885, at the new Central Institution at South  (1)(2)
Equipped by Thomson with a broad view of electrical physics, Ayrton  made a fairly smooth transition from telegraphy to power and light engineer- ing and soon built the Central Institution into Britains leading center for  electrical engineering education
His wife, Hertha Ayrton (1854–1923), was  also an electrical engineer and did important work on arc lighting
Although  he carried the process further than most, Ayrton was far from the only physics  professor in Britain to take up teaching electrical engineering in the 1880s and  1890s
In Liverpool, for example, Oliver Lodge set up a successful program in  “electrotechnics” that eventually outgrew his physics department and became  a separate department of electrical engineering in 1901

In Germany, the infl uential industrialist Werner von Siemens issued a call  in 1881 for all Technische Hochschulen to offer instruction in electrical engi- neering
The next year the Technische Hochschule at Charlottenburg, just  outside Berlin, began offering courses in dynamo and motor construction in  its mechanical engineering department and soon developed close ties to AEG,  Siemens, and other big German electrical fi rms
In 1887 a new government  research institute, the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, opened in Char- lottenburg under the direction of Hermann von Helmholtz; its work on stan- dards and measurement further strengthened the links between electrical sci- ence and technology
Other schools launched free-standing programs in  electrical engineering, many of them directed by physics professors
In 1882 the  physicist Erasmus Kittler was appointed to head the worlds fi rst full depart- ment of electrical engineering at the Darmstadt Technische Hochschule, where  he quickly built up a large and successful program
Among his many students  was Michael Dolivo-Dobrowolsky, who went on to perfect the three-phase AC  induction motor in 1890
As the demand for electrical instruction rose, more  physicists were hired to teach in the growing Technische Hochschulen, as well  as in German universities
The pattern of electrical engineering education getting its start in physics  departments was strongest in the United (1)(2) At MIT, physics professor  Charles Cross launched an “alternative course” in electrical technology that,  after starting with 18 students in 1882, quickly grew to become the largest pro- gram in the school
By 1889, Crosss electrical program had over 100 students,  far more than the regular physics course, and it kept growing through the  1890s before fi nally breaking off as a separate department of electrical engineer- ing in 1902
At Cornell University, William Anthony began offering electrical  engineering courses in the physics department in 1883 and soon built up the  largest and best-regarded program in the country
Although Anthony left Cor- nell for private industry in 1887, the electrical program he had founded con- tinued to prosper: by the mid-1890s it had over 300 students, and demand for  its graduates consistently exceeded the supply
Even after it became a separate  department in 1888, electrical engineering at Cornell retained close ties to phys- ics
Electrical engineering students outnumbered physics majors in many ad - vanced physics courses, and much of the research in the Cornell physics de - partment continued to focus on electrical problems
By 1900, substantial electrical engineering programs had sprung up at uni- versities and technical colleges throughout the United States, most of them  growing out of physics departments
Among the largest and most important  were the programs at the state universities in Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois, and (1)(2) Each year, hundreds of students passed through these programs and  took jobs with national electrical fi rms or regional utility companies
Led by  the “electricals,” engineering shed its association with apprenticeship and in - reasingly came to be seen as the preserve of college-educated professionals
Particularly at the big state universities, students looking to get ahead in the  world increasingly chose engineering over more traditional courses in the hu - manities, leading a literature professor to grumble in 1908 that his fi eld would  soon be dismissed as fi t only for “sissies
” Nowadays, he lamented, “the really  virile thing is to be an electrical engineer
”¹¹ Virile or not, electrical engineer- ing was certainly attracting more and better students
As the president of Cor- nell had observed in 1891, “The importance which electricity has recently as - sumed in so many ways, has drawn into special studies of the subject a large  number of our ablest and most scholarly men
”¹² Electrical engineering departments retained close ties with physics long  after their formal separation and long after the era of dynamos and light bulbs  had given way to the age of radio, radar, and solid state electronics
The line  separating advanced research in electrical engineering from work in physics  was often thin or nonexistent
Physics, too, was deeply affected by its role in  giving birth to electrical engineering as an academic discipline
Electrical tech- nology had created the fi rst real market for the expertise physicists had to offer; and the rise of the power and light industry in the 1880s and 1890s, with the  concomitant rise in student numbers and public profi le, drove an increase in  the number of physicists and in the resources available to support their work
By the mid-1890s, physics was a signifi cantly different and much stronger dis- cipline than it had been just 20 years before

As the nineteenth century headed into its fi nal decade, physicists could look  back with satisfaction on what they had achieved
Guided in large part by the  belief that all physical phenomena were ultimately mechanical, they had for- mulated sweeping laws of heat and energy, deciphered the workings of the  electro magnetic fi eld, and helped forge technologies that had transformed  modern life
Their discipline had grown in size and stature and added greatly  to humans understanding of the physical world and their practical power over  it
Citing both Hertzs discovery of electro magnetic waves and the recent har- nessing of electricity to provide power and light, (1) (1) FitzGerald compared  his fellow physicists to modern Prometheans; thanks to them, he declared in  1888, mankind had “snatched the thunderbolt from Jove himself and enslaved  the all-pervading ether
”¹ One of the keys to this success had been their deter- mined pursuit of purely mechanical explanations, and physicists fully expected  that further progress, both intellectual and material, would come by continu- ing along the same path
In the 1890s, however, this sense of optimism and triumph was joined by  an undercurrent of unease
When William Thomson was raised to the peerage  as Lord Kelvin in 1892, he was recognized as the embodiment of the nine- teenth- century union between physics and technology; he had also long been  a leader in the quest for purely mechanical explanations
Yet he had to admit  that, despite its many successes, the mechanical program had not managed to  deliver the grand “theory of everything” it had long promised
When the Uni- versity of Glasgow held a jubilee in 1896 to mark his fi ftieth year as a professor  there, Kelvin chose one word to sum up all of his efforts to grasp the ultimate  foun da tions of physical reality: “failure
” “I know no more of electric and  mag netic force,” he said, “or of the relation between ether, electricity, and pon- derable matter, or of chemical affinity, than I knew and tried to teach to my 1
(1) (1) FitzGerald, “Address to the Mathematical and Physical Section of the British Asso- ciation” (1888), in Joseph Larmor, ed, The Scientifi c Writings of the Late George Francis FitzGerald (Dublin: Hodges and Figgis, 1902), p(1)
students of natural philosophy fi fty years ago in my fi rst session as (1)(2)”² Kelvin never lost his own faith in the mechanical program, but as the century  drew to a close, others increasingly asked whether physicists had perhaps been  chasing a mirage
If the 1890s marked the end of one era in physics, however, the decade  also saw the fi rst stirrings of a new one
Between 1895 and 1900, physicists  made a series of remarkable experimental discoveries, including X-rays, radio- activity, and the electron
Worlds of previously unsuspected phenomena sud- denly opened before them, and as the nineteenth century gave way to the  twentieth, physicists increasingly turned their attention to the new physics of  atoms and radiations—realms where many of the old rules of mechanics no  longer seemed to apply
The laws of energy and electro magnetism that they  had forged amid the technologies of the nineteenth century survived, but in  the new century physicists would fi nd those laws cast into a new and unex- pected light
Ether Winds When FitzGerald invoked it in 1888, most physicists looked on “the all-pervad- ing ether” as a fundamental and well-established reality, as real, many said, as  the air we breathe
The wave theory of light had been abundantly confi rmed  long before, and it seemed obvious that there could be no waves without a  medium to carry them
The exact nature of that medium remained far from  clear, however, and throughout the nineteenth century physicists struggled to  devise a workable mechanical model of it
Fresnel had shown in the 1820s that to sustain waves like those of light, the ether had to have properties like  those of an elastic solid or jelly
Yet it was difficult to see how planets and other   bodies could move so freely through a solid medium, nor could any ordinary  elastic solid support the forces required by Maxwells electromagnetic theory
In the 1880s a number of British physicists took up alternative theories, par- ticularly the “vortex sponge,” which pictured the ether as a liquid fi lled with a  tangle of squirming vortices
The whirling motion of such vortices could store  enormous amounts of energy, and there were tantalizing hints that a vortex  sponge might be able to account for Maxwells fi eld equations
FitzGerald said  in 1893 that he had “a sort of feeling in my bones” that it must be the true  theory of the ether
³ It was extremely difficult to analyze the turbulent motion 2

of such a medium mathematically, however, and even the most enthusiastic  proponents of the vortex sponge could not tell if they were on the verge of a  fundamental break through or off on the wrong track altogether
Whatever the ultimate structure of the ether, physicists were convinced  that the earth was moving through it at enormous speed
Aside from any mo - tion the solar system as a whole might have, they knew the earth was circling  the sun at about 30 kilometers per second (18 miles per second), or about 1 ⁄10,000 the speed of light
According to Fresnel, the ether remains wholly stationary  and slips between the atoms of the earth or any other moving body much like  water passing through a net—or, from the other point of view, like wind blow- ing through a grove of trees
Ordinarily, we do not notice this fl ow of ether,  but in principle it should affect our measurements of the speed of light, since  light waves going against the ether wind would be slowed down, like a swim- mer heading against the current in a river, while those going with it would be  similarly sped up
If such a difference in speeds could be detected, it would  provide direct evidence of our motion through the ether and so of the exis- tence of the ether itself
Detecting a difference in speeds of one part in 10,000 would be a daunting  task, given that direct measurements of the speed of light in the mid-nine- teenth century often differed from one another by several percent
In fact, the  problem was much worse than that
The only practical ways to measure the  speed of light all involved refl ecting a beam back to its starting point
For such  a round trip, in which the beam is slowed down going against the fl ow of ether  and sped up going back with it, the effect of the ether wind would be propor- tional not to the simple ratio of the speed of the earth (v) to that of light (c), but instead to its square (v 2/c 2)—not to one part in 10,000, but to one in 100 million
Detecting such a tiny difference seemed impossible, and Maxwell, for  one, despaired of anyones being able to do it
In 1880, however, a young physics instructor at the (1)(1) Naval Academy,  (1) (1) Michelson (1852–1931), took up the challenge
Already a master of pre- cision optical measurement, Michelson saw that if he could split a beam of  light, send its two parts off in different directions, and then recombine them,  the waves would interfere and produce a pattern of fringes that would be ex - quisitely sensitive to any change in the speeds or path lengths of the beams
By  noting the position of this pattern, turning his “interferometer” through a  90-degree angle, and then looking for any shift in the fringes, he should be able  to detect a difference as small as one part in 100 million between the speed of  a beam that went with and then against the ether wind and one that simply  went back and forth across it
Michelson built his fi rst interferometer while on a study trip to Germany and took careful observations with it early in 1881
To  his sur prise, he found no signifi cant shift of the fringes and no sign of the  expected ether wind
Michelson did not conclude that the ether does not exist, any more than  that the earth stands still in the heavens
Instead, he took his null result as sup- porting a theory the Irish physicist (1) (1) Stokes had proposed in the 1840s
According to Stokes, the ether does not blow freely through the moving earth,  as Fresnel had said, but instead is dragged along by it, both within the earth  and for a substantial distance around it
On Stokess view, Michelsons inter- ferometer would no more be exposed to an ether wind than someone riding  within a ship is exposed to the ocean breeze
A Dutch theoretician, (1) (1) Lorentz (1853–1928), read Michelsons expla- nation but was not convinced
Lorentz reexamined the whole problem of mo - tion through the ether and concluded that if the earth really dragged the ether  along as Stokes had suggested, rays of light reaching us from distant stars would  be affected in ways that astronomers do not observe
He also found an error in Michelsons Interferometer In 1881, Albert (1) Michelson, a young  American physicist studying in Germany,  used his newly invented interferometer,  pictured here, to try to measure how fast  the earth was moving through the ether
By splitting a beam of light and sending  the two resulting rays bouncing back and  forth both with and across the earths line  of motion, Michelson hoped to be able to  detect the slight effect the “ether wind”  blowing across the moving earth ought to  have on the speed of light
He found no measurable effect, however, either in 1881 or when he repeated the experiment more  carefully with (1) (1) Morley in 1887
Michelsons results raised deep questions  about the ether and our supposed motion  through it that were not fully resolved  until Albert Einstein formulated his theory  of relativity in 1905
� Albert (1) Michelson, “The Relative  Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous  Ether,” American Journal of Science 22 (1881): 124
Michelsons calculations that reduced the expected effect of the ether wind  from one part in 100 million to one in 200 million, raising doubts that the 1881 experiment had really been conclusive
Convinced that the ether wind was real  and must ultimately be detectable, Lorentz urged Michelson to repeat his ex - periment with a larger and even more sensitive interferometer
In 1887 Michelson, by then a professor at the Case Institute of Technology  in Cleveland, teamed up with (1) (1) Morley to do just that
Starting with a  thick block of stone fi ve feet square, they fi tted it with the fi nest optical appa- ratus and fl oated it in a tub of mercury so they could easily turn it without  producing any stress or distortion, for they knew that even the tiniest change  in the dimensions of the block would throw off their measure ments
The new  interferometer was much more sensitive than Michelsons old one and should  have been able to detect motion through the ether far slower than the known  orbital speed of the earth
Yet when Michelson and Morley took their readings  in July 1887, they again found no appreciable shift of the fringes
The expected  ether wind evidently did not exist
As Oliver Heaviside later remarked, the Michelson-Morley experiment pre-  sented physicists with “a fl at contradiction
”⁴ A wide array of experiments had  confi rmed Fresnels theory, which said there must be an ether wind; Michelson  and Morleys experiment, though evidently well designed and admirably per- formed, had failed to detect it
Something had to give
Seeking to draw the  logical noose as tight as possible, Oliver Lodge set out in 1891 to test whether  rapidly moving matter might drag along the ether near it—in effect, to test  Stokess theory directly, instead of relying on Lorentzs rather subtle astronom- ical arguments
Drawing on the latest technology, Lodge took a large electric  motor, mounted two large steel discs on its axle, and set it spinning at thou- sands of revolutions per minute
He then ran a beam of light through the  narrow space between the discs and used a type of interferometer to look for  any sign that the light was dragged along by the spinning discs
He found  none
The evidence for a stationary ether seemed overwhelming, with Michel- son and Morleys result as the one piece that stubbornly refused to fi t
Exasper- ated, Lodge declared in 1893 that “this experiment may have to be explained  away
”⁵ By then, as Lodge well knew, FitzGerald had found a surprising way to do  just that
At the end of 1888, Heaviside had, for the fi rst time, worked out the  complete formula for the electromagnetic fi eld around a moving charge

an electric charge moves, it sets up a magnetic fi eld; the motion of that mag- netic fi eld then sets up a further electric fi eld, and so on in an infi nite series of  ever smaller correction terms, each of them proportional to higher and higher  powers of v/c, the ratio of the speed of the charge to that of light
To Heavisides  sur prise, this cumbersome infi nite series converged to a very simple result: the  electric fi eld around a moving charge is just like that of an ordinary charge at  rest, but compressed along its line of motion by a factor of �(1 � v 2/c 2)
Heaviside made a point of telling his friends about this result, and FitzGer- ald thus had it fresh in his mind when, in the spring of 1889, he paid a visit to  Lodge in (1)(2) As they sat in Lodges study discussing Michelson and  Morleys experiment, it suddenly occurred to FitzGerald that if matter is held  together by electromagnetic forces, then these forces ought to be affected by  motion through the ether
In fact, he said, we should expect a body moving  through the ether to contract along its line of motion (or, what came to the  same thing, to expand laterally) by the factor of �(1 � v 2/c 2) given by Heavi- sides formula
For ordinary speeds, this contraction would be very small; even  for a body moving at 30 kilometers per second, it would come to only about  one part in 200 million, so that the entire diameter of the earth would shrink  by only about 6
centimeters (2
inches)
But a contraction of one part in 200 million would, of course, be just  enough to mask the effect Michelson and Morley had been looking for
A  beam of light going against the ether wind would indeed go a little more  slowly, as Michelson and Morley had assumed, but it would have a slightly  shorter distance to travel, and the two effects would cancel each other out
FitzGerald concluded that this contraction must be real and that Michelson  and Morleys experiment was almost the only way to detect it—though seeing  no effect at all certainly counted as an odd way of “detecting” something
FitzGerald was a fi rm believer in both the reality of the ether and the validity  of Maxwells laws of electromagnetism
He was pleased that those laws allowed  him to “explain away” Michelson and Morleys troublesome result so neatly  and thus save the ether from an experiment that seemed to tell against it
In  many ways, however, FitzGeralds explanation made the ether seem more elu- sive and inaccessible than ever
When they performed their experiment, Michelson and Morley were not  trying to probe the inner structure of matter, but simply to measure the speed  of the earth through the ether
For FitzGerald, however, the contraction hy - pothesis put the focus fi rmly on the question of just what holds a piece of  matter together
It took several years before other physicists began to pick up  on the idea that motion through the ether might affect the size of a body, but by the mid-1890s, several lines of inquiry were converging to focus physicists  attention on the underlying structure of matter and the relationship between  atoms and fi elds
Electrons Electrons were invented by theoreticians before they were discovered by exper- imentalists
In his electromagnetic theory, Maxwell had generally treated ma - terial bodies as simply portions of the ether that possessed different electric and  magnetic properties—the ability to conduct a current, for example, or to sus- tain extra polarization
Maxwell was well aware that matter is made up of  molecules, of course, but he set that knowledge aside in formulating his gen- eral laws of electromagnetism
After the basic framework of Maxwellian theory  was consolidated in the late 1880s, however, theorists began to probe the con- nection between ether and matter more deeply
In the early 1890s, Lorentz in  Holland and Joseph Larmor (1857–1942) in Britain took the lead in creating  what became known as electron theory: the idea that ordinary matter contains  swarms of tiny charged particles that act on one another through the electro- magnetic fi eld
Electron theory proved immensely fruitful, and it was soon  backed up by direct experimental evidence that such particles—or at least  negatively charged ones—really exist
Initially, electron theory was the purest  of abstract physics, pursued with no thought of practical application
Within  a few decades, however, the manipulation of electrons in vacuum tubes and  later in transistors and integrated circuits would become central to the most  important new technologies of the twentieth century
Work on electrons also  marked one of physicists fi rst major steps into the world of atomic and sub- atomic phenomena that would absorb so much of their attention in the new  century
The idea that matter contains electric particles was of course not new in  the 1890s
In some form it could be traced back at least to the eighteenth cen- tury, and between the 1840s and the 1870s Wilhelm Weber and other German  physicists had worked out sophisticated mathematical theories based on the  assumption that tiny particles of electricity exert forces on one another directly  across empty space
In the last decades of the nineteenth century, however,  such action-at-a-distance theories were largely displaced by Maxwells fi eld  theory, particularly after Hertzs discovery of electromagnetic waves in 1888
The Maxwellians chief point was that electric and magnetic forces act through  the fi eld rather than directly at a distance, but they also attacked the idea that  there was really such a thing as “electricity
” Electric charge, they said, is just a  superfi cial effect of tensions in the surrounding fi eld, and an electric current results not from any real fl ow of electric particles but simply from the break- down of electric tension within a conductor
Strict Maxwellians looked on the  whole idea of “electric fl uids” or “particles of electricity” as badly outmoded
Lodge spoke for many, especially in Britain, when he declared in 1889 that “few  things in physical science appear to me more certain than that what has so long  been called electricity is a form, or rather a mode of manifesta tion, of the  ether,” and not itself a real thing at all; the word “electri fi ca tion” might survive,  he said, but “‘electricity may gradually have to go
”⁶ No sooner had Lodge dismissed electric particles as obsolete relics, how- ever, than they began to make a comeback, with Lorentz leading the way
Like  many Continental theorists, he had always found Maxwells ideas about  charges and currents to be vague and unsatisfactory
It was all very well to say  that a current results from the breakdown of tension within a conductor, but  until one could say just what that tension was and exactly how it broke down,  the process remained mysterious
In the wake of Hertzs experi mental confi r- mation of Maxwells fi eld theory, Lorentz looked for a way to graft what he saw  as the best parts of the older German particle theories onto a solid new Max- wellian foundation
Lorentzs basic idea was simple: ordinary matter, he suggested, is fi lled with  tiny charged particles—he began to call them “electrons” in the late 1890s—that are able to move freely in conductors but are bound in place in insulators
One  could look on an electron either as the source of the electromagnetic fi eld  around it or, as Faraday and Maxwell would have preferred, as simply the  center on which the surrounding lines of force converge
Most bodies contain  equal numbers of positive and negative electrons, Lorentz said, and so are  electrically neutral; those with more of one kind than the other carry a net  charge
Lorentz looked on an electric current not as a mysterious breaking  down of tensions in the fi eld, but as simply a fl ow of electrons within a con- ductor; polarization, he said, was just the elastic displacement of electrons  from their equilibrium positions within an insulator
Armed only with his hypothetical electrons and Maxwells fi eld equations,  Lorentz proceeded to give clear and consistent explanations for all of the main  phenomena of electromagnetism, as well as for such optical effects as refl ec- tion, refraction, dispersion, and Faradays magneto-optical rotation
Lorentz  always treated ether and matter as completely separate, with the ether re - maining wholly stationary while matter, sprinkled with electrons, moved freely  through it
This led him quite directly to the contraction hypothesis, which he 6

hit on independently of FitzGerald in 1892: if matter is held together by the  forces between electrons, Lorentz reasoned, then motion through the ether  ought to cause bodies to contract along their line of motion by just the factor  of �(1 � v 2/c 2) needed to “explain away” Michelson and Morleys result
Lorentz published a fi rst version of his electron theory in 1892 and a fuller  account in 1895
By then, the Cambridge mathematical physicist Joseph Lar- mor had begun to develop his own ideas about electrons, led to them not by  German theories about electric particles but by a peculiar kind of ether theory
More than 50 years before, the Irish physicist James MacCullagh had proposed  an ether whose parts did not resist being compressed or distorted, as those of  an ordinary elastic solid do, but instead resisted being turned in space
Although  this concept accounted very well for optical phenomena, and FitzGerald later  showed that its equations closely paralleled those of Maxwells electromagnetic  theory, MacCullaghs theory attracted little support at the time, largely because  no one could picture how a real mechanical medium could possess such purely  rotational elasticity
When Larmor took it up in 1893, however, he saw great  possibilities in MacCullaghs ether, especially when he realized that it could  support permanent vortex rings, whirling structures much like smoke rings
Building on an earlier idea of Kelvins, Larmor suggested that such vortex rings  might constitute atoms of ordinary matter, with the added bonus that rings in  MacCullaghs ether would form little loops of electric current that could inter- act electromagnetically
Larmor initially thought he had found the key to a  theory of everything; as he wrote to Heaviside in October 1893, “I fancy I have  got a grip of the aether, and I am full of the matter
”⁷ Larmor soon ran into problems, however
His theory implied that ether  must fl ow along lines of magnetic force, yet when Lodge looked for evidence  that light waves were affected by such a fl ow, he found none
It also turned out  that the forces between Larmors vortex rings were in the wrong direction: two  rings in the rotational ether whose fl ows ran in the same direction would repel  one another, whereas the corresponding loops of electric current would attract
FitzGerald sent Larmor piles of letters on the subject in the spring and summer  of 1894 and eventually convinced him that the only way to make his theory  work would be to replace his vortex rings with isolated electric charges—kinks  in the rotational ether that would be able to move freely through it, rather like  knots sliding along a rope
Borrowing a word fi rst coined by his uncle, the  physicist (1) (1) Stoney, FitzGerald dubbed these charges “electrons,” a name  that soon stuck
Many things now fell into place, and though Larmor contin- 7

ued to cite the rotational ether, after July 1894 he put most of his efforts into  working out the consequences of introducing electrons into Maxwells fi eld  theory
Working independently of Lorentz, he reached many of the same   conclusions, and by the time they became aware of each others work in 1895, the two men had produced comparably well developed versions of electron   theory
To this point, electrons remained purely hypothetical
Lorentz and Larmor  had shown that a wide range of electromagnetic and optical phenomena could  be explained by assuming that matter contains tiny electrifi ed particles, but  they could not point to any direct evidence that such electrons actually ex - isted, nor could they say much about their possible size or mass
In the later  1890s, however, the situation changed rapidly
Experimentalists began to turn  up abundant evidence that electrons—or at least negatively charged ones— were not only real but ubiquitous, fi lling and perhaps constituting all of the  matter around us
The fi rst direct evidence for the existence of electrons was brought to light  in the fall of 1896 by a Dutch physicist, Pieter Zeeman (1865–1943), who had  studied under (1)(2) Physicists had long known that, when heated in fl ames,  chemical elements give off light at characteristic frequencies; sodium, for ex - ample, emits yellow light that forms a well-defi ned double line in the spec- trum
Following up a suggestion Faraday had made many years before, Zee- man placed a sodium-laced fl ame between the poles of an electromagnet and  used a diffraction grating to examine the spectrum of the light it emitted
When he switched on the magnet, he saw the previously sharp sodium lines  spread to three times their former width
On hearing this, Lorentz quickly  showed that it followed directly from his theory: the magnetic fi eld would act  on the electrons oscillating or orbiting within the sodium atoms, he said, and  slightly alter the frequency of the light they gave off
In fact, Lorentz said, a  magnetic fi eld should not just widen the spectral lines but actually split them  apart—a prediction Zeeman confi rmed when he repeated his experiment with  a more powerful magnet early in 1897
By carefully measuring the polarization  and other properties of the split spectral lines, Lorentz and Zeeman were able  to show that the oscillating electrons must carry a negative charge and have a  ratio of mass to charge less than 1⁄1,000 that of an ordinary hydrogen ion
Zee- mans experiments helped turn electrons from mere theoretical constructs into  real objects that physicists could measure and manipulate
Zeemans electrons were bound within atoms
The other main line of evi- dence for their reality emerged from work on cathode rays, in which electrons  fl y freely across space
As far back as the eighteenth century, experimenters had noticed a strange glow when they applied an electric charge to a pumped-out  glass tube
In the nineteenth century, physicists in Germany and Britain in - serted wires and plates into such tubes and studied the cascades of glowing  colors that appeared when they ran electric currents through the rarefi ed gases  within them
In the 1870s, as improved vacuum pumps (similar to those Edi- son used for his fi rst light bulbs) made it possible to achieve lower pressures,  physicists increasingly turned their attention to the mysterious rays given off by the negatively charged plates, or cathodes, within the tubes
Though them- selves invisible, these cathode rays produced a glow where they hit the glass of  the tube, and objects placed in their path cast sharp shadows
Moreover, a  magnet held outside the tube defl ected the rays, suggesting that they carried  an electric current or at least marked the path of one
Most British experiment- ers believed the rays to be tiny bits of electrifi ed matter thrown off from the  cathode, while most of their German counterparts thought the rays were more  likely to be waves or other disturbances in the ether
(1) (1) Thomson (1856–1940) was just 28 when he was appointed Cavendish  Professor of Experimental Physics at Cambridge University in 1884
Under  Maxwell, and especially under his successor Lord Rayleigh, work at the Cav- endish had focused on precision electrical measurement, including an im - portant redetermination of the ohm
Thomson had little fl air for such exact  measurement and turned instead to more rough-and-ready qualitative experi- mentation, particularly on electrical discharges and cathode rays
Although he  and Larmor were close contemporaries and lived just a few blocks apart in  Cambridge, they had little contact in the 1880s and 1890s
Thomson worked  out his ideas about electrifi ed particles—or “corpuscles,” as he called them— quite independently of Larmors electron theory
In 1897, Thomson succeeded in defl ecting cathode rays with an electro- static fi eld, strongly reinforcing the argument that they were charged particles  rather than waves in the ether
Moreover, by comparing these electrostatic  defl ections with those produced by a magnetic fi eld, he was able to fi nd a  rough value for the corpuscles ratio of mass to charge: about 10�11 kilograms  per coulomb
This ratio was the same regardless of what metal he used for the  cathode and what residual gas remained in the tube; it was also not far from  the value Zeeman and Lorentz had found spectroscopically a few months be - fore
By April 1897 Thomson felt his experimental evidence was strong enough  that he could publicly suggest that negatively charged corpuscles, much smaller  than atoms and all possessing identical mass and charge, are elementary con- stituents of all matter
(Positive charges were less accessible and evidently re - mained locked within atoms
) In later years Thomsons 1897 announcement was often said to mark “the discovery of the electron
” In fact, there was no  single dramatic moment of discovery, and it was only two or three years later,  as evidence piled up from several other directions, that most physicists became  convinced that electrons really existed
As electrons came to be accepted as real, they increasingly came to be  viewed as truly fundamental
In their mathematical explorations of Maxwells  theory in the 1880s, (1) (1) Thomson and Oliver Heaviside had noticed that  electric charges possessed “electromagnetic mass,” as their interaction with the  surrounding fi eld gave the charges just the sort of resistance to any change in  their speed or direction of motion that ordinary particles of matter have by  virtue of their inertial mass
In a sense, the mass of a charged particle seemed  to reside not within the particle itself but in the fi eld or ether around it
It did  not take long before theorists began to suggest that there might be no such  thing as mass in the ordinary sense, but only the electromagnetic mass of the  tiny charged particles that clump together to form material bodies
Many  physicists continued to look on this in terms of a mechanical ether whose parts  possessed ordinary mass, but others went further and advocated what became  known as the “electromagnetic view of nature
” We should give up trying to  derive the laws of electromagnetism from the workings of a mechanical ether,  they said, and instead take Maxwells equations as fundamental
They could  then hope to reduce the laws of mechanics, and ultimately all the rest of phys- ics, simply to the interactions of fi elds and electrons
In 1889, Oliver Lodge had hailed Hertzs discovery of electromagnetic  waves and the consequent confi rmation of the electromagnetic theory of light  in very up-to-date language: “The whole domain of Optics,” he declared, “is  now annexed to Electricity, which has thus become an imperial science
”⁸ By  the end of the 1890s, it appeared that electricity was on the verge of annexing  virtually everything else and extending its empire over the full reach of the  physical world
Invisible Rays and Unstable Atoms The electron was an important experimental discovery but not an especially  surprising one
There had been hints that matter contained tiny charged par- ticles long before Zeeman, Thomson, and others fi rst demonstrated their exis- tence
By contrast, the discovery of X-rays at the end of 1895 came out of the  blue
It was positively startling and soon set off a chain of other surprising  discoveries, including that of radioactivity
It seemed for a time that previously 8
Lodge, Modern Views, p(1)
unsuspected properties of matter and radiation were turning up every month,  and these discoveries, along with continuing research on electrons, served to  focus physicists attention far more closely than ever before on atoms and the  energies they contained
X-rays, radioactivity, and electrons also provided ex - perimenters with powerful new tools they could use to probe the inner work- ings of atoms, and led as well to important new technologies
Wilhelm Röntgen (1845–1923) discovered X-rays in November 1895 while  experimenting with cathode rays in his laboratory at the University of Würz- burg in (1)(2) Like many physicists of the time, he was intrigued by the  fl uorescent glow that appeared where cathode rays struck the glass walls of  their tubes
Other physicists had already found that if they inserted a thin  aluminum “window” into the wall of a tube, they could shoot cathode rays  right through the metal and into the surrounding air, though the rays went  only a few centimeters before they were all absorbed
Physicists detected the  rays by letting them fall on a piece of paper coated with a fl uorescent com- pound, rather like the material used on blacklight posters
To make the fl uo- rescence more easily visible, Röntgen darkened his laboratory and wrapped his  tube in cardboard to block out the light it gave off directly
When he did so,  he noticed a faint glow coming from a spare piece of fl uorescent paper several  feet from his tube
Sure that ordinary cathode rays could not possibly reach so  far through air, he examined the phenomenon more closely
He soon estab- lished that penetrating rays of some kind—he called them “X-rays” to empha- size their unknown nature—were emanating from the glowing spot where the  cathode rays struck the glass
The X-rays passed through paper, wood, even  solid walls, and not only lit up a fl uorescent screen but left an image on ordi- nary photographic fi lm
Some materials were more transparent than others,  and dense metals such as lead blocked almost all of the rays
Röntgen found  he could use X-rays to take shadow photographs of metal objects within a  closed wooden box, and even of his own bones through the fl esh of his hand
After Röntgen made his initial discovery, he worked in complete secrecy  for several weeks, intent on confi rming as much as he could before announc- ing such a startling result
He later said he was afraid people would think he  was crazy, and at fi rst he did not tell even his wife what he was up to
Finally,  just before Christmas 1895, he brought her to his laboratory, showed her what  he had found, and, placing her hand on a photographic plate, took an X-ray  picture that clearly showed every bone
Röntgen intended simply to give a  dramatic demonstration of the penetrating power of his new rays, but his wife  was reportedly disturbed by the sight, seeing in the shadow of her bones a  premonition of her own death
Röntgen sent a brief account of his fi ndings to the local Würzburg scien- tifi c society, which published it at the very end of December 1895
On New  Years Day 1896 he sent copies, including a few X-ray photographs, to leading  physicists in Germany and elsewhere
The news created an immediate sensa- tion
Within a week, breathless reports were appearing in newspapers across  Europe, and Kaiser Wilhelm soon called Röntgen to Berlin to deliver a special  lecture about his discovery
It was the photograph of his wifes hand that did  it
People were fascinated by the prospect of being able to see the bones beneath  their fl esh, and more broadly by the idea that unseen realities might now sud- denly be made visible
News accounts excitedly discussed the possible medical  uses of X-rays, and within weeks of Röntgens fi rst announcement, physicists  and physicians were using the new rays to locate bullets lodged in victims fl esh  and aid in setting broken bones
Engineers soon developed special-purpose  X-ray tubes and turned Röntgens laboratory discovery into a practical medical  tool
As X -ray machines were integrated into medical practice, they proved  enormously useful, though physicians eventually recognized that overexposure  to the rays could pose serious dangers
X-rays were fascinating and useful, but just what were they
The idea of  invisible rays was not entirely new, of course; infrared and ultraviolet light had  been known since the early nineteenth century, and physicists had shown that  Hertzs long electro magnetic waves could readily pass through solid walls
At Röntgens X-Ray Picture  of His Wifes Hand The German physicist Wilhelm Conrad  Röntgen took this X-ray photograph of his  wife Berthes hand in his Würzburg labora- tory in December 1895
Its publication the  next month touched off a worldwide sen- sation; people were intrigued and morbidly  fascinated by the prospect of being able to  see the bones beneath their skin

fi rst Röntgen thought his rays might be a kind of pressure wave in the ether,  but it soon became clear that X-rays were ordinary electromagnetic waves  with extremely short wavelengths—in effect, ultra-ultraviolet light
The wave- lengths of X-rays were, in fact, comparable to the spacing between atoms in  ordinary matter, enabling many of the waves to pass right between the atoms
If the atoms in a body were arranged in a regular pattern, some of the X-rays  could bounce off and interfere with each other, producing “X-ray diffraction patterns” that could be used to work out how atoms were arranged within  crystals and molecules
Decades later, X-rays would be used in this way to fi nd  the double helix structure of DN(1)
Röntgens discovery soon sparked a search for other kinds of invisible rays
Some of these proved illusory, such as Gustave le Bons “black light” and later  René Blondlots “N-rays,” both of which turned out to owe more to a will to  believe than to any real physical phenomenon
In early 1896, however, the  French physicist Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) made a discovery that proved far  more consequential
Noting that Röntgens X-rays emanated from the fl uores- cent spot where the cathode rays struck the glass wall of the tube, Becquerel  asked whether naturally fl uorescent materials might give off similar rays
He  placed samples of various fl uorescent minerals on top of sealed photographic  plates, left them there for a day or so, and then developed the plates
Most of  the plates came back blank, but one on which he had placed a piece of a ura- nium compound came back fogged
On investigating further, he found that  the fogging had nothing to do with ordinary fl uorescence, but was caused by  rays emanating directly from the uranium
Becquerel had discovered what  soon came to be dubbed “radioactivity
” Becquerels discovery did not stir up anything like the excitement Rönt- gens had, but it drew the attention of a young Polish-born physicist, Marie  Curie (1867–1934, born Marya Sklodowska) and her husband Pierre Curie  (1859–1906)
Marie Curie began to study not just uranium but the ore it came  from, looking for signs of other radioactive substances
Following up Bec- querels fi nding that the rays from uranium could ionize air and discharge an  electrometer, she conducted tests that showed uranium ore (pitchblende) to be  substantially more radioactive than uranium itself
Determined to isolate the  source of this additional radioactivity, she set about laboriously extracting,  purifying, and testing the various components of the ore
Pierre joined in, and  by 1898 they had isolated a tiny speck of a new and highly radioactive element,  which they named “polonium” in honor of Maries native country
Yet the re - maining residue was still strongly radioactive, and the Curies tentatively iden- tifi ed another element in it, thousands of times as radioactive as uranium, to which they gave the name “radium
” To nail down the case, they obtained over  a ton of pitchblende and began the arduous work of isolating the radium  within it
By 1900 the Curies had extracted a few tenths of a gram of nearly  pure radium, enough to establish its main chemical and physical properties
It  was soon clear that they had isolated one of the most extraordinary substances  ever discovered
The Curies radium continually poured forth energy, though it did not  seem to be itself consumed or altered in any way
It made fl uorescent mate- rials glow in the dark (leading to its later use in luminous watch dials) and  re  mained measurably warmer than its surroundings
According to the fi rst  law of thermodynamics, energy could neither be created nor destroyed, yet  ra  dium seemed to create energy out of nothing
The Curies tiny speck of ra - dium threatened to undermine one of the foundations of nineteenth century   physics
Many other physicists and chemists soon joined Becquerel and the Curies  in studying the strange new phenomena of radioactivity
One of the most  active was Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937), a young New Zealander who had Caricature of Marie and Pierre  Curie with Radium By the time Marie and Pierre Curie were  awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in  December 1903 for their discovery of  radium, the mysterious radioactive element  was already becoming an object of public  fascination
This caricature of the Curies  holding a glowing vial of radium appeared  in a popular British magazine of the day  and refl ected public interest not just in the  new element and its surprising properties  but also in the married pair of researchers  who had discovered it
� Vanity Fair, 22 Dec(1)
arrived in Cambridge in 1895 to work with (1) (1) (1)(2) Rutherford worked  fi rst on a detector of radio waves, and for a time could achieve greater ranges  than (1)(2) In 1896, however, he switched to the hot new subject of X-rays  and radioactivity and soon made it his own
Rutherford and others showed  that radioactive substances give off three different kinds of radiation: gamma  rays, which are essentially very powerful X-rays; beta rays, which are simply  high-speed electrons; and the far more massive alpha rays, which were eventu- ally identifi ed as the nuclei of helium atoms
In 1898 Rutherford moved to McGill University in Montreal, where he  teamed up with the chemist Frederick Soddy (1877–1956)
By 1903, they had  reached a radical conclusion: radioactive substances, they said, were not as un - changing as they fi rst appeared but were in fact continually decaying away
As  radioactive atoms gave off alpha and beta rays, Rutherford and Soddy said,  they were actually disintegrating and changing into different elements—an  especially startling idea for chemists, committed as they were to the perma- nence of chemical elements, but one that saved the physicists law of the con- servation of energy
Radium and other radioactive substances were thus not  generating energy out of nothing but simply releasing stores of energy that  had somehow been locked inside them
Each kind of radioactive atom—and  some elements evidently came in several distinct varieties, which Soddy dubbed  “iso topes”—decayed at a characteristic rate into a lighter atom, which in turn  decayed until the chain terminated in a stable isotope
It would take over four  billion years for half of any given quantity of uranium to decay, through a long  series of steps, into stable lead
Radium, one of the intermediate steps in this  chain, has a half-life of about 1600 years; it decays, in turn, into radon, a radio- active gas with a half-life of just 3
days
Rutherford left Canada in 1907 to take a position at Manchester in Eng- land; he later succeeded Thomson as Cavendish professor at (1)(2) He  continued to work on radioactivity, using alpha rays to probe the structure of  atoms and showing in 1911 that they consist of a massive central nucleus sur- rounded by a swarm of lighter electrons
Soddy returned to Britain in 1904 and  took up the broader implications of radioactivity in a popular book, The Inter- pretation of Radium (1909)
Atoms, he said, hold far more energy locked within  themselves than can be released in any ordinary chemical reaction
A kilogram  of radium or uranium contains, and very gradually releases, millions of times  as much energy as we could obtain by burning a kilogram of coal or even de - tonating a kilogram of dynamite
If we could fi nd a way to release the energy  within an atom all at once, rather than waiting for it to dribble out on its own  over billions of years, we could, Soddy said, make the world a paradise—or perhaps destroy it
(1) (1) Wells took up Soddys ideas in his novel The World  Set Free (1914), picturing a future that included both devastating atomic bombs  and peaceful atomic power plants
It would be several decades before physicists would fi nd ways to release  atomic energy at will, but by the end of the 1890s they could already sense that  vast new possibilities, for good or ill, lay before them
Atoms, long a matter of  theoretical inference, were now experimental facts, rendered palpable in the  laboratory
Just as physicists were fi nally bringing them into focus, however,  atoms of such elements as uranium and radium were visibly slipping away,  decaying into bursts of energy and streams of rays
Having at last penetrated  to the apparent bedrock of the material world, physicists found it to be discon- certingly unstable
Quanta The most far-reaching departure in twentieth-century physics, the birth of  quantum theory, had important roots in work on a seemingly mundane topic:  light bulbs
The tradition of precision measurement that marked so much of  nineteenth-century physics, from Joules work on heat and energy to the deter- mination of the ohm and other electrical units, was closely tied to the tech- nologies of steam power and telegraphy
By contrast, the new work in the  1890s on electrons, X-rays, and radioactivity had relatively little connection to  practical technologies and often involved only rough measurements; many of  (1) (1) Thomsons measurements of electrons, for example, were accurate to no  more than a factor of two or three
Other physicists continued to practice  precision measurement, however, and it sometimes led them to important new  discoveries
A case in point came in 1900, when German physicists analyzed  the energy radiated by heated bodies—in effect, by the fi laments of light bulbs
Deep within their careful measurements of “blackbody radiation” lay the fi rst  clues that energy is not continuous and infi nitely divisible, but instead is par- celed out in discrete quanta
It took several years for theorists to grasp the full  implications of this discovery; when they did, the resulting quantum theory  revolutionized their understanding of how, at the most basic level, the physical  world works
It had, of course, long been known that bodies glow when heated, emitting  radiant heat and light across the spectrum
In 1859 Gustav Kirchhoff had used  the laws of thermodynamics to prove that the total amount of energy given off by a “blackbody” (defi ned as a body that absorbs all light and radiant heat that  falls on it) does not depend at all on its material composition but solely on its  temperature
By the mid-1890s, physicists had extended this to show that the amount of energy a blackbody emits at any particular wavelength—in effect, the color of the light it gives off when heated—must also be a function solely  of its temperature, though they could not yet reduce the relationship to an  exact formula
Finding the blackbody radiation formula was of fundamental theoretical  importance, for it promised to shed light on the basic relationship between  matter and energy
Max Planck (1858–1947), a leading theorist at the Univer- sity of Berlin, saw this clearly and wrestled with the problem throughout the  1890s, striving to understand how bodies exchange energy with the electro- magnetic fi eld and eventually come into thermal equilibrium with it
Beyond  its purely scientifi c interest, however, the blackbody problem also had practical  implications relating to the efficiency of both electric light bulbs and the newly  invented incandescent gas mantles, which produced light by heating metallic  compounds to a white hot glow
To produce the most abundant and pleasing  light for the least expenditure of energy, manufacturers needed to know how  much light incandescent fi laments and mantles would emit at different tem- peratures and what colors would predominate
For that, they needed accurate  measurements and reliable standards of comparison, backed up if possible by  theoretical understanding
At the behest of the German lighting industry, physicists at the Physika- lisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR), or Imperial Institute of Physics and  Technology, near Berlin took up the light emission problem in the mid-1890s
The German government had established the institute in 1887 after a long  campaign by the industrialist Werner von Siemens, who also contributed much  of the money to get it started
Siemens had always advocated close relations  between science and technology, and he hoped the PTR would strengthen  both German industry and the German state
He persuaded Hermann von  Helmholtz, Germanys most eminent physicist, to serve as its fi rst director, and  the new institute soon set to work as both a national bureau of standards and  a center for original research
Otto Lummer headed the optical laboratory at the PTR and was a master  of precision measurement
In the late 1890s he and his collaborators devised  sophisticated techniques for measuring the intensity of light emerging from a  small hole in a hollow chamber held at a high temperature—the hole serving  as the nearest practical equivalent of an ideal blackbody, in that it “absorbed”  all of the radiant energy falling on it
Lummer and his group were happy to  have their work serve the needs of the German lighting industry, but it is clear  that they were motivated mainly by a desire to use their skills and resources to  solve a signifi cant scientifi c puzzle
It is just as clear, however, that they would not have been able to use the resources of the PTR to tackle that puzzle had  not those in charge seen their blackbody measurements as having practical  value
⁹ In the late 1890s, German theorists worked out formulas for blackbody  ra  diation that seemed to fi t well with both the available measurements and the  known laws of energy and electromagnetism
Since the energy radiated by a  blackbody was independent of its physical composition, theorists were free to  assume whatever structure they found simplest to analyze
In 1899 Planck gave  what appeared to be a particularly good derivation of the blackbody formula  based on treating the body as made up of an immense number of tiny “Hertz- ian oscillators,” essentially small electric circuits that could resonate to produce  electromagnetic waves
It was like picturing the blackbody as covered with tiny  tuning forks and then analyzing how it would ring when repeatedly struck
With his derivation of the blackbody formula, Planck appeared to have  fi nally given mathematical form to one of the basic relationships between mat- ter and energy
Late in 1900, however, new and better measurements came to  hand from the PTR experimentalists, and these no longer quite fi t the formula  Planck had so carefully derived
The difference was small, and had the data  from the PTR been less precise or reliable, the discrepancy would no doubt  have been ignored and the old formula retained
Planck, however, took the  new measurements very seriously and felt compelled to fi nd a theory that could  account for them
Finding a formula that fi t the new data was not hard; Planck came up with  one within a few days
Making sense of it was another matter, and in Decem- ber 1900, after trying every trick he could think of, Planck was driven to what  he later called “an act of desperation
”¹⁰ Physicists had always assumed that the  energy of an oscillator could have any value within its range, from zero up to  the maximum the oscillator could hold
This was just common sense, like as - suming that a pendulum can swing through any angle
Planck had made the  same assumption in his original theory, but the result it led to did not fi t the  new measurements
Now he found he could derive the correct formula only  by assuming that the oscillators in his blackbody could only possess certain  amounts, or “quanta,” of energy, proportional to the frequency of the oscilla- tions multiplied by a very small number, h, that came to be called “Plancks  constant
” It was as if energy came in lumps, or as if a body could have a tem- 9

perature of, say, exactly 20 degrees or exactly 30 degrees but nothing in between
It was a startling assumption and one with far-reaching consequences
Planck had not set out to overturn the basic structure of physics, and at  least at fi rst, he did not think he had
He fully expected that the apparent divi- sion of the energy of his oscillators into discrete quanta was illusory and that  he would eventually fi nd a way to explain it in terms of ordinary physical  mechanisms
Try as he might, however, he could never fi nd such a solution
Quanta, it seemed, were real
Plancks blackbody theory looked at fi rst like a small and tentative adjust- ment in a specialized corner of physics; only in retrospect did it appear as the  starting point of a great revolution
Albert Einstein took an important step  toward that revolution in 1905 when he applied Plancks idea of quanta not just  to oscillators but to radiation itself, suggesting that the energy carried by light  is not spread uniformly across the wave front but is bundled in packets, later  known as “photons
” The idea was gradually taken up by others and applied  to problems of atomic structure, most notably by the Danish theorist Niels  Bohr (1885–1962) in his 1913 model of the hydrogen atom
Here, the ordinary  laws of mechanics that Newton had laid down more than two centuries before  no longer seemed to hold
In the 1920s physicists formulated a new set of laws,  quantum mechanics, that proved spectacularly successful in accounting for  atomic phenomena, but at the expense of some startling assumptions
Not  only did energy come in packets, but both light and electrons seemed to behave  sometimes like waves and sometimes like particles
Probability replaced strict  causality, and physical reality itself seemed to fuzz out and become indetermi- nate when one attempted to examine it on the smallest scale
In the opening  years of the twentieth century the old mechanical program, as conceived and  pursued with such success in the nineteenth century, seemed to be breaking  down completely
Einstein at the Patent Office In June 1905, a young patent examiner at the Swiss federal patent office in Bern  sent the Annalen der Physik, the leading German physics journal of the day, a  paper entitled “On the Electrodynamics of Moving (1)(2)” Albert Einstein  (1879–1955) had been wrestling with problems of motion and electromagne- tism for years, since his student days at the Polytechnic in Zurich, and he had  hit on a surprising solution, based on the “principle of relativity,” only a few  weeks before
Einsteins paper passed almost unnoticed when it fi rst appeared,  but it later came to be seen as marking one of the great revolutions in modern  science
Those who look on Einstein as an icon of pure science are sometimes  surprised to learn that he discovered the theory of relativity while working in  a patent office, examining designs for electrical machinery
In fact, however,  some of the chief roots of relativity lay precisely in the analysis of the workings  of dynamos and electric motors
Many paths led Einstein to his relativity the- ory; one of the main ones led straight through the Swiss patent office
Einstein was born in March 1879 in Ulm in southern (1)(2) His father,  Hermann, was a partner in a fi rm that sold featherbeds, but Einsteins uncle  Jakob was an ambitious engineer who soon convinced his brother to quit the  bedding business and join him in a booming new fi eld: electric power and  light
The families moved to Munich in 1880 and launched (1) Einstein and  Co  mpany
Over the next decade, the fi rm prospered by providing both arc and  incandescent lighting and by selling dynamos and other electrical equipment  of Jakobs design
The company displayed its wares at international electrical  exhibitions and reached a high point in 1889 when it won the contract to light  the Schwabing district of (1)(2) Living as he did among the new electrical  technology, Albert was exposed to spinning coils and magnets from an early  age, both in the factory that stood near the family home and in conversations  with his uncle (1)(2) He showed early ability in mathematics and physics  and reportedly helped solve electrical design problems while still a schoolboy

(Stories that Einstein was considered slow in school have no basis in fact
He  was late to begin to speak, but once he started school he excelled in the sci- ences, mathematics, and most other subjects
He chafed under the rigid disci- pline of German schooling, however, and his teachers sometimes complained  that he did not show them proper respect
) (1) Einstein and Company made direct current equipment, and when alter- nating current began to win out in the early 1890s, the fi rm proved unable to  make the shift
The Einsteins had counted heavily on landing the Munich  municipal lighting contract; when, amid a general consolidation of the electri- cal industry, the contract went to a larger fi rm in 1893, their company was  forced into bankruptcy
Hermann and Jakob moved to northern Italy and  tried to open a factory and power station at Pavia, but that effort failed as well,  and by 1896 they were forced out of business for a second time
When his family moved to Italy, 15-year-old Albert was left behind in Mu - nich to complete his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium, an elite secondary  school
Lonesome and unhappy, he dropped out after a few months and joined  his family in (1)(2) There, he helped around the electrical workshops and stud- ied on his own in hopes of entering the Polytechnic in Zurich and becoming  an engineer
Regarded as a very promising youth, he was allowed to take the  entrance examination in 1895 when he was only 16, but while he did well in  mathematics and physics, he fell short in other subjects
He spent the next year  studying at a Swiss secondary school, passed his examinations, and entered the  Polytechnic in October 1896, still several months shy of the official minimum  age of 18
Modeled after both the French Ecole Polytechnique and the German Tech- nische Hochschulen, the Zurich Polytechnic was one of the top science and  engineering schools in Europe, with a particularly outstanding electrical labo- ratory
Einstein often skipped classes, but he studied hard on his own and  completed his degree on time in 1900
His interests had shifted from engineer- ing to theoretical physics even before he entered the Polytechnic, and he now  set his sights on an academic career
There were few positions available in the  fi eld, however, and after two years of scrapping for short-term teaching jobs,  he counted himself lucky when the Patent Office in Bern hired him as a “tech- nical expert third class” in 1902
Einstein would remain there until 1909, years  he later recalled as the happiest of his life
Switzerland was then emerging as an important center of the electrical in - dustry, its mountain streams powering numerous hydroelectric projects and its  engineers taking the lead in building electrical systems of all kinds
Designs for  new types of dynamos, motors, and other electrical machinery poured into the Bern patent office, where Einsteins command of Maxwells theory made him  a valued member of the staff
He soon learned the craft of the patent examiner,  subjecting each application to searching criticism and insisting that inventors  explain every point as clearly and rigorously as possible
Nothing was to be  taken for granted and every assumption was to be carefully scrutinized
Einstein turned the same critical eye on problems in theoretical physics,  delving deeply into statistical mechanics, blackbody radiation, and the photo- electric effect
He focused especially on a problem that had been troubling  physicists for years: how to reconcile electro magnetic theory with the ordinary  laws of motion
In Newtonian mechanics, only the relative motions of bodies  really count, yet in Maxwellian fi eld theory, the ether appeared to provide a  universal standard of rest, a backdrop to which all motions had to be referred
This was not a purely abstract question, fi t only for speculative philosophers
As a patent examiner, Einstein faced the problem of relative motion every time  he had to analyze closely the workings of a dynamo
When Einstein fi nally hit on his solution to the problem in 1905 and wrote  up his paper for the Annalen, he did not open with a discussion of the Michel- son-Morley experiment or the latest measurements of the defl ection of cath- ode rays
Instead, he started by describing a seemingly simple case of electro- Albert Einstein at the Swiss  Federal Patent Office in Bern In June 1902, when he was 23 years old,  Albert Einstein was hired as a “technical  expert third class” at the Swiss Federal Pat- ent Office in Bern, where he specialized in  examining patents for dynamos, motors,  and other electrical devices
The job paid  well, and once he had mastered the rou- tine, he was able to use his free time to  pursue nagging problems in theoretical  physics—including some concerning the  relative motion of coils and magnets that  also cropped up when he was analyzing  dynamo designs
This photograph was  taken during Einsteins years at the patent  office, which he later described as the hap- piest of his life

magnetic induction, the effect Faraday had discovered in 1831 and that now  provided the basis for the electric power industry
Consider a magnet moving  near a conductor—a bar magnet, for example, being plunged into a coil of  wire
“If the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest,” Einstein noted,  “there arises in the neighborhood of the magnet an electric fi eld with a certain  defi nite energy,” which then produces a current within the conductor
But if  we hold the magnet stationary and instead move the coil over it, Maxwells  theory tells us that something quite different happens: “If the magnet is at rest  and the conductor is in motion, no electric fi eld arises in the neighborhood of  the magnet
” Instead, as the conductor moves through the magnetic fi eld, an  electromotive force, to which there is no corresponding fi eld energy, acts to  produce an electric current within the conductor
If the relative motion of the magnet and conductor is the same in the two  cases, the current will be the same as well, but its source will be explained very  differently: in the fi rst case, the motion of the magnet will produce a new elec- tric fi eld, presumably involving a real change in the ether, while in the second  case the electrons within the conductor will simply be pushed sideways as they  move through the magnetic fi eld, with no new electric fi eld being pro duced at  all
Of course, there was no way to tell whether it was the magnet or the con- ducting coil that was “really” at rest, and it was hard even to say exactly what  it meant to say so
Clearly, Einstein said, simply applying Maxwells theory to  moving magnets and conductors led to “asymmetries that do not seem to be  inherent in the phenomena
”² In tracking down and eliminating those asymmetries, Einstein was led to  reexamine basic assumptions about space and time and to redefi ne what it  meant for two events to be simultaneous
The result was a remarkably elegant  and self-consistent theory, but one in which electric and magnetic fi elds, mass  and energy, and even space and time themselves were mixed together in sur- prising ways
Moreover, Einstein declared that in his theory, “the introduction  of a ‘light ether will prove to be superfl uous,” in that there would be no need  either to assume a universal stationary frame of reference or to ascribe veloci- ties to points in the electro magnetic fi eld—that is, to treat the fi eld as an ether  whose parts can swirl or fl ow
At a stroke, Einstein had brought together two  of the great branches of physics, mechanics and electromagnetism, and resolved  the long-standing tensions between them
In many ways he had set the cap- stone to what later came to be called “classical” physics—but in the process 2
Albert Einstein, “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies” (1905), in Stachel, Einsteins  Miraculous Year, p(1)
had eliminated the mechanical ether on which so much of classical physics had  been based
Einstein did not develop his theory of relativity in an effort to improve the  design of dynamos, nor did it have that effect
Although he said in his paper  that his theory served to dissolve persistent controversies about the true “seat  of electromotive force” in unipolar dynamos (generators in which the conduc- tor slides along the surface of the magnet, producing a strong current at low  voltage), he saw this as at most a side issue
Einstein was fascinated by techno- logical problems, but he was not motivated by technological aims
As was so  often the case in the history of physics, dating back to the work of Carnot,  Clausius, and Thomson on steam engines and thermodynamics and of Thom- son, Maxwell, and Heaviside on telegraphs and electromagnetism, new tech- nologies had brought intriguing new phenomena to the fore, and physicists  had responded by making them the focus of their research
Technology pro- vided many of the most important tools for scientifi c research and much of the  environment within which physicists thinking developed
Einstein would eventually leave the patent office and take his place as the  most revered scientist of the twentieth century
By the 1930s he was widely  viewed as a sort of holy man of science, dwelling in a rarefi ed intellectual realm  far above the mundane world
It is worth remembering, however, that some of  Einsteins most important insights were rooted in the spinning coils and mag- nets of ordinary dynamos and motors, in the practical technologies that had  brought the world both power and light
There are several good surveys of nineteenth-century physics on the one hand  and of the associated technologies on the other, but very few books connect  the two

Th e fi rst is to provide a historical outline of the life of James Watt, a general overview that will assist in situating my specifi c, and rather specialized, argument about the centrality of chemistry to his life and work
Th e second is to explain the structure and the strategy of my study, as well as some of the basic assumptions that underlie it
Th e ‘Great Steamer – A Life Outlined James Watt, who the geologist Roderick Murchison referred to in 1839, with a peculiar mixture of deference, aff ection and condescension, as ‘the Great Steamer,1 had been born just over a hundred years earlier, in 1736, to a mod- erately prosperous merchant family in Greenock, a small town on the lower reaches of the River Clyde, near Glasgow in (1)(2) Watts paternal grandfa- ther was a ‘professor of mathematics, teaching that subject and navigation in a community dominated increasingly in the mid-eighteenth century by maritime trade
Watts father was a ships chandler and general merchant
While Watts elder brother John entered the family business – he was lost at sea on a merchant venture – the family was prosperous enough to invest in an informal apprentice- ship for Watt to the London-based instrument maker John (1)(2) Th e young Watts time in London was undoubtedly diffi  cult
He worked exceedingly hard and suff ered problems with his health
But the experience opened up for him a world of instruments, skills and trade that profoundly shaped his later career
Th e next step in that career was Watts establishment as an instrument-maker at the University of Glasgow, within the confi nes of the (1)(2) Th ough Watt certainly did make and repair instruments for the professorate of the College he also engaged in a more general trade in musical instruments and fancy toys
In the early days he was also an agent for his fathers business and plied the gen- eral hardware trade
By all accounts, as a child Watt had been studious and thoughtful, though his education at the local grammar school had been badly interrupted by health problems
Whatever the case with his early education, aft er his apprenticeship he became an ardent and eff ective autodidact
He took full advantage during the later 1750s and early 1760s of the associations with the Glasgow College professorate, and students, that his position at the College gave him
Th ese were the years of his ‘discipleship with the newly appointed Professor of Chemistry, Joseph Black, from whom, in an informal fashion, Watt imbibed much of his early knowledge of chemistry, and of the chemistry of heat in par- ticular
Th ese were the years of Watts fi rst experiments with steam and with a model steam engine, famously given to him to repair by the Professor of Natural Philosophy, John Anderson in 1763
During this time too Watt befriended a number of students at the university, young men close to his own age
Among these was John Robison, his lifelong friend, and in his later years a key witness, both legal and literary, to Watts work on the steam engine
On Glasgow Green today, in the shadow of the massive obelisk commemo- rating Lord Nelson, is a modest, inscribed boulder supposedly marking the spot where, in 1765, having contemplated the problems of the model Newcomen engine, Watt had the sudden inspiration of the separate condenser
His idea of condensing the steam in a separate vessel rather than in the main cylinder into which it had originally been injected led to a transformation in the effi  ciency of steam engines
Th e boulder celebrating this supposed ‘Eureka
moment was placed there only as recently as 1969, the year of the bicentenary of Watts fi rst steam-engine patent claiming the separate condenser as his invention
Th e story of the inspiration on Glasgow Green, however, goes back to the early nineteenth century
Th ere is no direct evidence of its veracity in the Watt archives and it is one of many examples of the diffi  culties of separating fact and fi ction in Watts life
By the time that he took out his patent, Watt was already in a partnership with Dr John Roebuck of Kinneil, with a view to constructing a steam engine on Watts new principles
Progress was slow and, faced with the exigencies of sup- porting a new family – Watt had married a cousin, Margaret Miller, in 1764, and their fi rst child Margaret had been born in 1767, with James Jr following two years later – he abandoned the instrument and hardware business to pursue his fortune for the next few years as a journeyman civil engineer and surveyor
Watt worked on a score of projects, mainly canal and harbour surveys but also bridge and waterwheel constructions in the early 1770s
It was whilst away from home, having just begun the Caledonian Canal survey, in September 1773, that Watt learned that his wife had died in the aft ermath of childbirth
Th is brought his life to a state of personal and professional crisis
Th e work he was pursuing was incompatible with his obligation to his motherless children, and left  him little time to pursue his true engineering enthusiasms
To cap it all, his partner in the steam-engine venture was in fi nancial diffi  culties and it was increasingly obvious that the project was not going to prosper under his auspices
In these circumstances, in 1774, Watt left  Scotland to settle in Birmingham in the English Midlands and to pursue a new partnership with Matthew Boul- ton, the entrepreneurial ‘hardware man of that town
Watt had met Boulton and members of the circle known as the ‘Lunar Society8 some years before
In fact, one of that circle, Dr William Small, had given Watt important advice on drawing up the specifi cation for his 1769 patent
Boulton, who had his own reasons for being interested in steam power, negotiated an agreement with Roebuck for the ‘transfer of Watt and his scheme to Soho, (1)(2) Th e incipient engine was removed from Kinneil and installed at the Soho manufactory
Watts 1769 patent had already run a signifi cant part of its course and the new partners capacity to exploit it was only just reaching fruition, and so, as part of the new partnership arrangements, Boulton and Watt agreed to seek an extension of the patent by Act of (1)(2) Here Boultons well-known and well-honed lobbying skills came into their own and the partnership was granted an extension of the 1769 patent (redrawn in 1775 so as to constitute a new one) to the year 1800
In Birmingham, Watt certainly profi ted from and enjoyed the natural phil- osophical intercourse with his fellow ‘Lunatics, as the members of the Lunar Society designated themselves
His natural philosophical knowledge and acumen increased considerably during this period
But the late 1770s and early 1780s were also a diffi  cult time for (1)(2) Th e primary market for the fi rst Boulton & Watt engines at this period lay in the mining districts of Cornwall where Newcomen engines had been used for many years in pumping the mines
Although in retro- spect we can say that the Boulton & Watt engines off ered decisive advantages in effi  ciency (notably in the saving of fuel, which was expensive in Cornwall) that ought to have made penetration of the market easy, at the time much resistance was encountered
Th e early engines were not problem-free, and canny Cornish mine venturers sought to drive hard bargains
Th e business of erecting engines and adapting them to local circumstances was vexed
Watt had to spend much time ‘on the road in Cornwall attending to these matters, a task to which he was temperamentally unsuited
Contentious, face-to-face (or even toe-to-toe) negotiation, bargaining and industrial ‘arm wrestling of the sort that Boulton thrived upon, distressed (1)(2) Headaches, hypochondria and fi ts of depression plagued him – as he had previously put it, he would ‘rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain
Boultons sometimes reckless business practices also worried Watt, who as a much more cautious businessman, was on occasion a valuable counterpoise to his partners excesses of fi scal irresponsibility and blind enthusiasm
Gradually, a degree of business stability, together with staffi  ng arrangements that removed Watt from the ‘front line of the Boulton & Watt venture, gave him more time and opportunity to pursue further steam experiments, other philo- sophical interests and inventive activities
Th e arrival of the Reverend Joseph Priestley in Birmingham in 1780 gave renewed impetus to Watts chemical investigations and interests
Priestley was already renowned for his discoveries of new ‘airs
He and Watt shared many chemical interests, but it was Priest- leys experiments on the explosion of infl ammable air with common air and with dephlogisticated air that led Watt into one of his few, high profi le public appear- ances in the annals of late eighteenth-century natural philosophy
In 1784 Watt published papers in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of Lon- don, the most famous of them forming the basis of his claim to have been the discoverer of the compound nature of water
Th is claim was far from uncon- tested either at the time or subsequently
In the Philosophical Transactions of the same year the eccentric, aristocratic natural philosopher Henry Cavendish pub- lished the paper that would be the basis for his own claim, and Lavoisiers later, but consummately theorized and prosecuted, experiments added him to the list of claimants
What became known as the ‘water controversy did not create an enormous stir in the 1780s
Watt and his associates, for a time, vented their anger and frustration at what they saw as at best a careless appropriation of his ideas and at worst their outright theft
But there were good business reasons, if no other, for not creating too sustained a ruckus over the aff air
It was not until the mid-nineteenth century that the water controversy was fought out in earnest
Th e protagonists then had their own agendas
A crucial outcome of their strug- gle was to be a devaluation and mischaracterization of Watts chemical work
Even as he pursued these questions of high chemistry and philosophy Watt was also engaged in steam experiments that led him to the idea of ‘expansive working of the steam engine
Th is idea, and further key mechanical improve- ments, including the adaptation of the engine to rotatory motion, were the subject of Watts second major patent of 1782
With rotatory motion now read- ily achievable through Watts sun and planet gear system, the market for driving machinery was opened up to Boulton & Watt engines
Th e Albion Mill on the banks of the Th ames housed one of the early rotative engines for grinding corn
Th ough not fi nancially successful, and destroyed by fi re in 1791, the Albion Mill was a valuable demonstration project, which helped the partnership to move into other rotative applications, especially in textiles, where the bulk of their engine business was to be
Another interest that Watt began to pursue at this time was in the bleaching of textiles
As part of a growing internationalization of their ventures Boulton and Watt visited Paris in 1786 in response to a government invitation to advise on the pumping machinery supplying water to the Palace of (1)(2) Th ey were also hoping, vainly as it turned out, to secure a privilege (the French equivalent of a patent) for their engines in (1)(2) Whilst in Paris, Watt, who had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1785, met many of Frances lead- ing natural philosophers
Th ey were curious to meet a man whose steam engine improvements were already widely praised and whose papers in the Philosophi- cal Transactions had created such a stir
Th ese meetings were to greatly expand Watts subsequent participation in the republic of letters and, specifi cally, in the chemical debates of the late eighteenth century
One of these meetings was with Claude-Louis Berthollet who revealed to Watt his work on the bleaching powers of dephlogisticated muriatic acid
On his return Watt conducted his own experi- ments and a long correspondence with (1)(2) He advised his father-in-law, who was in the bleaching business, about the new processes and, more generally, played a signifi cant role in the introduction of those techniques into (1)(2)
Mention of Watts father-in-law reminds us that, aft er the loss of his fi rst wife, Watt had married again, to Anne Mc(1)(2) By all accounts a strong personality and a good organizer of Watts household, Anne bore Watt two more children, Gregory (b(1)) and Janet (known as Jessy, b(1))
Meanwhile Watts son from his fi rst marriage, James Jr, underwent a modern education that included a period of study and travel on the Continent, partially supervised and guided by Watts friend and chemical collaborator Jean André De (1)(2) Watt Jr was an independent-minded young man whose relations with his stepmother and his father were oft en stormy
He was apprenticed to the fi rm of Taylor and Maxwell in Manchester in 1788, where he participated both in the burgeoning scientifi c life of the town through the Literary and Philosophical Society (f(1)) and in the radical politics of some of his associates
During a visit to Paris with Th omas Cooper in late 1791 and 1792 Watt Jr expressed solidarity with the early revolu- tionaries, a move which, when reported in the British press as the action of ‘James Watt, caused his father much embarrassment and distress
For a while Watt Jr was in great danger in the increasingly violent factional maelstrom of the mature revo- lution
Eventually, in 1794, he managed to return to England and, aft er a period lying low to ensure that he would not be arrested by British authorities, Watt Jr returned to his family and to the business
From that point onwards Watt Jr was to assume an increasingly prominent role in the business aff airs of the newly con- stituted Boulton, Watt & (1)(2) as the business was gradually passed on to the next generation
Watt Jr, perhaps in an eff ort to assuage his guilt about early wayward- ness, became an assiduous, almost maniacal promoter and defender of his fathers reputation, especially his claims as an inventor and discoverer
An early forum for Watt Jrs eff orts in that direction was the patent trials of the 1790s
In the face of what they regarded as repeated infringements of their patents by engine ‘pirates, Boulton & Watt had considered legal action from the early 1780s
But it was not until the early 1790s, when defaults on fi nancial agreements by Cornish engine users became increasingly widespread, that they began to prosecute
A long, complex, expensive and vexed series of legal cases challenged Watts ingenuity and stoked the fi res of his hypochondria for most of that decade
Th e eventually successful outcome enabled Boulton & Watt to recoup a very large sum of money in arrears
By this time, in 1800, the original patents had run their course and Watt retired from business
Other domestic troubles stalked Watt in the early 1790s in the shape of the poor health of his younger children
Jessy succumbed to tuberculosis at the age of fi ft een in 1794, aft er a harrowing illness
His parents invested great hopes in young (1)(2) Bright and personable, he showed considerable promise as a phi- losopher, especially as a geologist, and studied at Glasgow (1)(2) But he too battled the dread disease and eventually died from it in 1804
Th e other child of Watts fi rst marriage to reach maturity, besides Watt Jr, his eldest child Margaret, had married James Miller, but she died in 1799, leaving four children
Th e Watts were no strangers to family tragedy
Th e prospect of fi nding an eff ective treatment for Jessy was one of the major reasons why Watt entered into another of his key collaborations, this time with Dr Th omas Beddoes, on the production and use of ‘airs for medicinal purposes
Watt designed, and Boulton & Watt manufactured and sold, an apparatus for producing therapeutic airs and for delivering them eff ectively to patients
But Watts involvement went beyond this into both the chemistry of air production and of therapeutic eff ects
Th e steps leading to the establishment of Beddoess short-lived Pneumatic Institution in Bristol are very revealing of Watts ongoing defence of the chemistry of phlogiston
Along with his old friend Priestley, by now driven into exile in Pennsylvania by the Church and King riots in Birming- ham in the early 1790s, Watt remained one of the last defenders of a phlogistic chemistry against the new chemistry most associated with the work of (1)(2)
In his later years and in retirement Watt remained actively inventive, though now much of the hands-on work was done by his son or by assistants
With John Southern, Watt further developed the steam indicator, a device whose early forms he had devised in the late 1780s and early 1790s, and which became, in the nine- teenth century, perhaps the most important of his lesser-known inventions because of its great utility in measuring the performance of steam engines
Watt also enjoyed spending time in the attic workshop of his home, Heathfi eld Hall, where he developed machinery for copying statuary
He and his wife travelled, and also purchased land in Wales, establishing the estate that became known as Doldowlod where Watt and his surviving son pursued the habits of country gentlemen
Released from the cares of business, Watt enjoyed better health than he ever had during his most active years
He gained a reputation as a rather genial, avun- cular sage, an ardent and entertaining conversationalist with a, perhaps surprising, taste for light fi ction
However, Watt, assisted and encouraged by Watt Jr and others of his circle, also assiduously attended to defending and cultivating his own public image and reputation
He monitored public accounts of his life and works and, where necessary, sought to correct or counter them
For example, when Olinthus Gregory, a professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, with an eye for support of the underdog versus the ‘establishment, included material favourable to the Watt steam engine rivals the Hornblowers in his treatise on mechanics, the Watts arranged for a damning review by John Playfair in the Edinburgh Review of just that part of the book
Watt was under pressure from various quarters to give an account of the history of his inventions, and he agreed to do this in a roundabout way by correcting and annotating the articles ‘Steam and Steam-engine that his friend John Robison had contributed to the third edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica in 1797
Watt reviewed some of his earlier experiments on steam with the assistance of John Southern, and incorporated the results into his annotations
Th ere too Watt published the last of a long line of accounts of his invention of the separate condenser
Watt received numerous honours, including Foreign membership of the French Institute in 1816 (one of only eight positions), and an honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Glasgow in 1806
He reportedly turned down a baronetcy when sounded out on the question by the government through Sir Joseph (1)(2)
Had this been accepted, or publicly known, it would have threatened the ‘outsider status that the Watt camp oft en sought to cultivate, partly through complaints about the failure of government to honour the great man with an appropriate title
Watt also made a few benefactions, including a gift  of books in 1816 to his native town of (1)(2) Eventually his son was to fund a library building in which to house those books, which became the Watt Monument Library, and a focus of local commemorations of the towns most famous son
Watt died, aft er a short illness, aged 83, on 25 August 1819 at Heathfi eld (1)(2) He was buried in Handsworth Parish Church in Birmingham where his business partner Matthew Boulton had preceded him
A statue in marble by Francis Chantrey soon dominated a side chapel in which Watt was buried
Th e obituaries fl owed, the most famous and oft -quoted being that in Th e Scotsman newspaper by Francis Jeff rey, the founder of the Edinburgh (1)(2) Th ough Watt was technically the improver of the steam engine, Jeff rey said, ‘he should rather be described as its inventor
As such he had conferred inestimable benefi t upon his country and upon humanity
He had ‘armed the feeble hand of man … with a power to which no limits can be assigned … and laid a sure foundation for all those future miracles of mechanical power which are to aid and reward the labours of aft er generations
Th e making of the legend was already well under way when the ‘Great Steamer departed, but there was a lot more to come
Th e Structure and Strategy of this Study Th is book has both a general and a specifi c intent
Th e specifi c purpose is to partially recast our understanding of James Watts improvements of the steam engine and the natural philosophical basis for them
Th e origins of the steam age, I will argue, lay in an intellectual universe that is profoundly alien to our own
I do not claim to have fully recovered that intellectual universe, but will be happy if I have pointed in the right general direction
So the comprehensive history of Watts chemical connections and activities through what we can loosely call the ‘Chemical Revolution remains to be written
Th is is not it
Indeed part of my specifi c purpose is to execute a necessary move preliminary to such a compre- hensive chemical reconstruction – to suggest that a history of Watts chemistry, if it were to be written apart from what are conventionally seen as his ‘steam engineering activities, would reinforce an artifi cial divide between the two which hinders the understanding of both
Th e broader purpose of the book is to exemplify the ways in which historical sources can be profoundly misleading for such attempts at reconstruction
In doing this I am pursuing old cautions about the perils of Whig history, and clearing away historiographical undergrowth by showing the contingent purposes of documents that have oft en been taken as transparent historical sources
Th e book is divided into two main sections – ‘Representations and ‘Reali- ties
Of course, I am aware that the realities that I off er in the second part of the book are simply my representations of the realities as I see and reconstruct them
My hope is that others will fi nd them a persuasive, or at least a suggestive, account, not that they will be treated as the end of history so far as my subject is concerned
In ‘Representations I pursue some of the sculptural, pictorial and textual representations of James Watt between his own time and the present, with emphasis on the nineteenth century
It was during the nineteenth century that Watt became a powerful and protean symbol
I am conscious, in presenting these representations, of the splendid work done recently on representations of Watt by Christine Mac(1)(2) Professor MacLeods work has been an important inspi- ration and substantive source for what follows
However, we intersect rather than coincide
MacLeods focus is that of an economic and cultural historian
She looks from representations of Watt outwards into the British economy and society in the nineteenth century and is concerned primarily with how images of Watt are constructed in the service of broader social and economic purposes
I look, primarily, from images of Watt ‘inwards into the knowledge economy, or, perhaps better, knowledge ‘ecology
As an important contributor to the devel- opment of arguably the most important technology of industrialization Watt became a symbol that many groups in the knowledge business were anxious to claim
Whether he could, or should, be characterized as a ‘natural philosopher, an ‘engineer, a ‘philosopher engineer, a ‘craft sman, or a chemist, as a discoverer or as an inventor, was an issue much contested
A particular strength of Professor MacLeods research on Watts reputation is the picture she draws of its construc- tion by the ranks of practical mechanics and other workers
Th is is an aspect that I am conscious of neglecting in the following pages, partly because my focus is upon those learned and professional classes in whose hands the construction of Watts learned character primarily lay
In analyzing these varied representations I draw a distinction between the ‘mechanical and the ‘chemical (1)(2) My reason for doing so is that my claim in ‘Realities is that Watt was in a crucially important sense a chemist
Th is is an unu- sual, and far from obviously justifi ed, claim – at least in the form that I advance it
Th us, in dealing with representations, I need to examine how and why the mechanical Watt obscured the chemical
Accordingly, Chapter 1 explores repre- sentations of Watt in marble, stone and brass, the famous story of Watt and the kettle, and the much less famous story of Watt and the steam indicator, by way of illustrating the dominance of the mechanical Watt in public representations of him
In Chapter 2 I off er some suggestions as to why the chemical Watt dis- appeared in the course of the nineteenth century
One reason was that the man himself, and his close associates, chose to recast the nature of his achievement in a way that ‘proofed it against rapidly shift ing understandings of the nature of heat
Another was that the chemical claim to fame that was allowed to sur- vive this process of self-fashioning, namely Watt as candidate discoverer of the compound nature of water, became the subject of a substantial controversy in which, for diff erent reasons, both the supporters and opponents of Watts chemi- cal pretensions helped to obscure his chemical understandings
In Chapter 3 I explore the creation of Watt the engineer during the same period
Some advo- cates of the development of ‘engineering science, in particular, adopted Watt as a symbol of what they held dear
In so doing there was an understandable tendency to modernize the man and his ideas
Overall then, characterizations of the great man are related to his self-fashioning, to the commemorations pushed by fam- ily and friends, and to the concerns and ambitions of groups seeking, or indeed declining, to adopt Watt as a symbol
Th e outcome of this ‘orgy of contending representations was a very useful, but profoundly misleading, ‘mechanical (1)(2)
In Part 2, ‘Realities, I turn to the reconstruction of the chemical (1)(2) Chap- ter 4 seeks to portray his chemical world and how it came to be that way
Watt was not ‘trained as a chemist in any meaningful sense
But through a series of informal associations, with Joseph Black, (1) (1) De Luc and Joseph Priestley in particular, and by a great deal of self-education, Watt did become a fi gure to be reckoned with in the chemical world of the late eighteenth century
I argue that his chemical ideas were the product of the interaction of theory and practice and in so doing bring together episodes in his life and work that are usually consid- ered to be unrelated to each other
Th e fact that those episodes can be brought together in this way is further evidence, I contend, for the importance of the chemical thread in his work
Having depicted Watts development as a chemist, I then turn in Chapter 5 to advance and argue the claim that the steam-engine improvements were a product of Watts chemical philosophy and that in that, and other, senses the steam engine of the late eighteenth century ought to be seen as a chemical device
Th e fi nal chapter off ers a concluding case study of Watt and the steam indicator
Watts development of the early versions of this device has encouraged some to regard him as prescient about the science of energy, even as what we might call a ‘proto-thermodynamicist, who anticipated some of the most central and important physical insights of the nineteenth century
In show- ing how elisions have been made between Watts use of this device, and the use made of it in the theory of thermodynamics, I suggest that his understanding of the indicator was essentially chemical in nature and fundamentally at odds with, rather than being an anticipation of, nineteenth-century thermodynamics
In ten years time we will mark the 200th anniversary of Watts death
Th e 100th Anniversary in 1919 recognized only the mechanical (1)(2) Perhaps the next commemoration will do more justice to the complexity of the remarkable achievements of a man who was, I suggest, a stranger to our usual ways of under- standing him
– 11 – 1 OF STATUES, KETTLES AND INDICATORS:  THE ‘MECHANICAL WATT I begin with a tale of three representations of James (1)(2) Th e fi rst is a famous and much-travelled marble statue, sculpted by Francis (1)(2) As I write it looms in the entrance hall of the National Portrait Gallery in (1)(2) Soon it may move to its intended permanent location at Heriot-Watt (1)(2) It began life in Westminster Abbey as an unoffi  cial national commemoration of a great national hero and benefactor
Th ough some considered its scale inap- propriate, others thought its monumentalism in proportion to the signifi cance of the man and his deeds
In the twentieth century its detractors eventually won and in 1960 it was replaced in the Abbey by a small bust of Watt and moved to the Transport Museum at (1)(2) Its passage was surely barely eased by strained arguments that Watt should take a place of honour among the para- phernalia of steam locomotion
When the Transport Museum was relocated to Figure 1
Watt by Chantrey in Suspension, c(1)
Originally in Westminster Abbey, the statue was left  behind when the Transport Museum, where it had been housed from 1960, moved from Clapham to (1)(2) ((1)K National Archives, Authors Photo) York, however, the attractions of the giant statue had faded and for some time it stood alone in the empty sheds at Clapham while its carers sought it a home (See Figure 1
)
Th e Science Museum did not want it; the stationmaster of Glas- gow Railway Station was unimpressed by the argument that it would grace the concourse there
Th e monumentalism of the nineteenth century was the source of mounting embarrassment to the twentieth until (1)(2) Pauls Cathedral agreed to take it, providing someone else would fund the reinforcement of the fl oor where the marble edifi ce was to stand
From (1)(2) Pauls the statue made its way to Edinburgh and there it stands in the entrance hall of the National Portrait Gal- lery, barely accommodated even without its original pedestal
Th e absence of the pedestal means that visitors have to make do with a photograph of the lapidary inscription by Lord Brougham that adorned it
Little noticed by passing patrons of the Gallery is the geometrical pattern that Chantrey had carefully engraved into the scroll on Watts lap
It symbolized the work that Chantrey believed Watt should be remembered for most
For a while within recent memory a large yellow kettle stood on Gourock Pier not far from the site of Watts birth in (1)(2) It functioned then as a tourist information centre but had been constructed originally for a Glasgow garden festival
If Glasgow ever hosts an Olympic Games perhaps the kettle will be the equivalent of the Victa lawn mower and the Hills Rotary Hoist that were represented at the opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney (1)(2) Glasgows, or at least Greenocks, most famous son is forever associated with the kettle that supposedly gave the young Watt the inspiration for his improvements of the steam engine
Innumerable juxtapositions of Watt and the kettle litter the cultural landscape
Most derive from two nineteenth-century paintings, one by Robert Buss, the other by Marcus Stone, which picture an anecdote concerning Watts youth that had been unearthed and propagated by his son James Watt (1)(2) Like Chantreys statue the kettle story has hidden aspects
It is a ‘true myth
When properly understood the association of Watt and the kettle teaches us much about the origins of the steam age
Th e third representation of Watt with which I begin my tale is also in Green- ock, on or near the site of Watts birth
Th is is a bronze, full-length statue of the great man, which looks out over the (1)(2) It was unveiled on 1 June 1908 by the American-Scottish steel magnate Andrew Carnegie when he opened the Watt Memorial Engineering and Navigation School on the site
Modern sightseers must oft en puzzle about the strange object that Watt is thrusting forward in his right hand
But among those applauding Carnegie on that spring day in
many would have understood that object very well from their everyday experi- ence of operating and tending the marine steam engines which powered many of the ships on the river behind them
It was an ‘indicator, a device used to measure the performance of steam engines, to diagnose problems with their operation and so enable adjustments to be made and their effi  ciency to be improved
So Watt, on the Clyde, wielded a device supposedly of his invention that had particular meaning for his local audience and for the engineering students who were to pass through the School founded in his name – a fi tting commemoration
However, we will see that the indicator, too, has other hidden aspects and meanings
Th e statue, the kettle and the indicator are nineteenth-century constructions of Watt, which embody a mythology about the great man
Th is book is about the construction of that mythology, the purposes that it served, how it obstructs our understanding of the intellectual origins of the steam age, and how we can see ‘behind it
Th e image of Watt to which the statue, the kettle story and at least one version of the indicator story all contributed was of a scientifi cally informed, or ‘philosophical engineer
Watt had investigated the physics of heat, and had anticipated some of the crucial features of thermodynamics as developed in the nineteenth century
On the basis of this understanding he had worked out how to improve the performance of the steam engine and, through the indicator, how to monitor that performance
His genius for contrivance had produced many other inventions and improvements such as the sun and planet gear system and the ‘governor, but understanding of the physical properties of steam was seen to be at the centre of his achievement
While this interpretation of Watt and his work is coherent and its origins understandable, I contend that it fails to capture the eighteenth-century reali- ties of Watts work and how he understood steam and the engine improvements that eventually made his fortune and his name
Th e science of heat was certainly central to all that Watt did, but that science was chemical in nature
Strange as it may seem to us, for him the steam engine was at its heart a chemical device
Lets discuss in turn, and in more detail, the statue, the kettle and the indicator to see how they refl ect the constructions of Watt in the nineteenth century
Where the Statue Stood Th e statue by Chantrey that began its wanderings in Westminster Abbey was, in fact, the third of fi ve versions of the same basic, seated model that were dis- tributed around (1)(2) Th e others were in Handsworth Parish Church (where Watt is buried); in the Watt Library, Greenock; in George Square, Glasgow; and in the Hunterian Museum in (1)(2) Th is sculpture was widely regarded as one of the fi nest examples of the work of Francis Leggatt (1)(2) Th e image shared many features of early nineteenth-century neoclassicism, but in other respects was vaunted – not least by Chantrey himself and his publicists – as a new, classic, national style of sculptural portraiture that avoided ‘allegorical aids and classicis- ing fi ctions such as partial nudity and antique drapery yet eff ectively conveyed by more direct means the character and achievements of the subject
Chantreys early sculptures concentrated on busts of scientists, engineers and doctors
Certainly in the case of Watt his work became the focus of debate about which sorts of national heroes should be commemorated in public statu- ary
Many, including the promoters of the Watt subscription, felt that it was vital to celebrate the progenitors of the productive forces transforming the world of enterprise and industry as much as the statesmen and military fi gures who were more traditionally accorded such treatment
In this regard the installation of Watt in Westminster Abbey had particular signifi cance
Some observers may even have seen the damage caused by the very process of installing the statue in St Pauls Chapel in the Abbey as symbolic of a changing of the guard
In the mid-nineteenth century, Hugh Miller recorded an encounter with the statue: I was a good deal struck, in one of the old chapels, – a little gloomy place, fi lled with antique regalities sorely faded, and middle-age glories waxed dim, – by stumbling, very unexpectedly, on a noble statue of James (1)(2) Th e profoundly contemplative coun- tenance – so happily described by Arago as a very personifi cation of abstract thought – contrasted strongly with the chivalric baubles and meaningless countenances on the surroundings tombs
Th e new and the old governing forces – the waxing and the wan- ing powers – seemed appropriately typifi ed in that little twilight chapel
Here Miller puts Watt (as represented by Chantrey) forward as a symbol of all that is new and rational in the modern world, and contrasts his monument with the meaningless regalia of the ‘old governing forces
Th e reference to Aragos description of the statue as representing abstract thought so well is signifi cant
Chantrey was widely noted for his powers of representing mind, an aspect of his naturalism
Th e idea that he had somehow captured Watts mind became part of the standard repertoire of commentary on the Watt statue
Figure 1
Th e Mechanical Drawing on the Lap of the Chantrey (1)(2) (Authors Drawing) Perhaps less noticed or discussed was the imagery on the scroll on Watts  lap, over which his hand, with its dividers, and his noble head, were poised
Th ere Chantrey carefully depicted, in another gesture towards naturalism, the  mechanical contrivances for which Watt was to be remembered (See Figure  1
)
Th e accurate representation of Watts mechanical ingenuity was part of the  naturalism of the sculpture
Th at ingenuity was an emanation of the mind cap- tured in the countenance
Th e ‘mechanical is represented not by a model or a  physical device but by a geometrical drawing of it
Watt, like Newton, is depicted  as a geometer and therefore a philosopher
His geometry is that of the spatial  arrangement of components of the steam engine with the condenser separate  from the cylinder, and the sun and planet gear arrangement solving the problem  of producing rotative from reciprocating motion
Th e Chantrey statue of Watt in Westminster Abbey was the result of a cam- paign run by Watt Jr and a number of his friends, including Charles Hampden  Turner, which culminated at a subscription meeting in the Freemasons Hall on  18 June 1824
As MacLeod explains, this was a highly symbolic occasion so far  as the contest over selection of national heroes was concerned
Many worthies  spoke on that occasion and the words have come down to us
One, Sir Humphry  Davy, President of the Royal Society, spoke of Watts chemical credentials but  most were anxious merely to emphasize that Watt was no ordinary engineer but  also a philosopher
Th e most famous, and enduring, words associated with the  statue, however, were those penned by Watts friend and supporter, Henry, Lord Brougham for the inscribed base of the edifi ce: Not to perpetuate a name Which must endure while the peaceful arts fl ourish But to shew Th at Mankind have learnt to honour those Who best deserve their gratitude Th e King His Ministers and many of the Nobles And Commoners of the Realm Raised this monument to  JAMES WATT Who directing the force of an original genius Early exercised in philosophic research To the improvement of Th e Steam Engine Enlarged the resources of his country Increased the power of man And rose to an eminent place Among the most illustrious followers of science And the real benefactors of the World Born at Greenock MDCCXXXVI Died at Heathfi eld in Staff ordshire, MDCCCXI(1)
Th ese words were most carefully craft ed and negotiated between Brougham and Watt (1)(2) Brougham had originally used the phrase ‘early trained in philosophic research but Watt Jr had objected strenuously
Th e not-so-deep subtext in this exchange, was the nature of the relationship between Watt and Joseph Black and the extent to which Watt had learned from the professor
Watt Jr was anx- ious to ensure that his fathers autonomous philosophical character was clearly acknowledged
At one point, Watt Jr asked Brougham ‘whether it would be proper in the Inscription to allude to his fathers discovery of the composition of water
Clearly, Brougham thought it a bad idea, and Watt Jr did not insist
Had such a reference been included then the chemical Watt might have gained a lit- tle more iconographic prominence
Unfortunately we do not have Broughams reasoned response to the suggestion
Perhaps he thought it best to remain on secure ground, or perhaps his rejection of the idea rested on the maintenance of harmony between inscription and sculpture
Th e latter so clearly depicted Watt as geometer and mechanician, that to introduce chemical discovery into the inscription would be confusing and detract from its coherence
It is worth making the obvious point here that the association of Watt with mechanical contrivance, which is so common in imagery of him, reinforces the mechanical rather than the chemical (1)(2) Not the least of the advantages of the mechanical Watt was the ease with which he could be depicted
Th e chemistry of steam rep- resented more of a challenge in that regard
Th ere the imagery of the kettle was, as we shall see, a possible, but highly problematic, solution
For the moment we can say that Broughams inscription, the dividers in Watts hand and the mecha- nism depicted on the paper on the statues lap all contributed to Watts status as philosopher, geometer and mechanician being set in marble
In the later nineteenth century a number of other sculptors were commissioned to produce statues of (1)(2) Some of these were eff ectively imitations of Chantreys statue
Even those not directly imitative oft en depicted the dividers and scroll, thus perpetuating the head and hand image of the philosopher-engineer
Th is is the form, for example, of the statue by William Th eed erected in 1857 in Manchester, and also of that by Henry Charles Fehr in City Square, (1)(2)
Th ere does appear to be a tendency for later nineteenth-century statues to depict Watt with specifi c devices of his invention
Th e statue by Charles Benham Grassby, now outside the ‘Peoples Palace on Glasgow Green, shows him leaning on part of an engine, though still holding a pair of dividers (See Figure 1
)
A similar statue, in that it features Watt standing beside a cylinder or condenser, was commissioned from the sculptor Albert Hemstock Lodge as part of the 1905–
extension scheme of the Port of (1)(2) It still stands today at 16 Robertson Street, Glasgow at the right of the pediment of the Clydeport building
Th e less papyrophilic, more device-centred, depiction of Watt was in tune with the growing tendency to describe him as a craft sman or craft sman-engineer in the later nineteenth and early twentieth century
It had appeared earlier in statues sup- ported or erected by artisans, including in the very early statue commissioned by the Glasgow Mechanics Institute in 1824
Th is work, by John Greenshields, has a life-size Watt leaning on a steam cylinder, and was imitated by (1)(2) Ray McKen- zie has remarked on the ‘populist egalitarianism that engendered the mechanics statue of the ‘Great Steamer
Th at populism was refl ected in its form
Later in the century, though, even the statue of Watt in the courtyard of the Oxford Museum of Natural History, dating from 1860, though it features more classical drapery and the dividers, has a bet each way when it also depicts Watt holding a device
An interesting variant, which requires a whole story to itself, and which I will return to below, is the statue by (1) (1) Fehr in Greenock which was unveiled by Carnegie in 1908
As already discussed, this too involves a device
Th e statue is in fact a copy of the one that Fehr executed for Leeds City Council in 1898
However, instead of the dividers in the right hand of the Leeds statue, in Greenock Watt holds up an indicator
Th e move to standing (active) fi gures in modern dress, holding or leaning upon actual devices – rather than contemplat- Figure 1
Watt by (1)(1) Grassby outside the ‘Peoples Palace, Glasgow (1)(2)
(Authors Photo) ing geometrical diagrams with large mind – is, I think, a signifi cant one
Watt the craft sman-engineer was being celebrated in these later statues by contrast with the philosopher-engineer of the earlier ones
What is certain is that all these fi gures, whatever their diff erences and whether by design or by default, set the ‘mechanical Watt in stone or brass
Kettle Mythology Watt and his kettle are everywhere still, today
Figure 1
depicts the large yel- low kettle already mentioned
Th is was built at the James Adams ship repair yard in Gourock in 1988 before being transported by barge up the Clyde to be installed at the Glasgow Garden (1)(2) Th e kettle was sponsored by the Solid Fuel Advisory Service under the slogan ‘Were Steaming Ahead
Local worthies, speaking at its ‘launch, expressed hope that the economic tide was turning for the Inverclyde district and saw the kettle as symbolizing the ‘natural imagina- tion and inventiveness for so long associated with the local people
Th e Greenock Telegraph elaborated: ‘Inspired by Greenock-born engineer and steam pioneer James Watt, the Inverclyde Kettle symbolizes the areas spirit of enterprise and challenge through the sugar trade, ship building and heavy engineering indus- tries to modern day electronics
At the Garden Festival the kettle sat on a bed of real coal adorned by fl owers simulating fl ames, whilst inside exhibitions and vid- eos promoting Inverclyde could be seen by visitors
Th e kettle was subsequently Figure 1

Th e depth and range of the kettle mythology can be illustrated by the rather mature looking Watt and his kettle found in the late nineteenth-century Japa- nese wood block print reproduced in Figure 1
Watt, overseen by his aunt, is described as ‘measuring water drop by drop as it condensed from steam coming out of the spout of a kettle in an attempt to produce steam-powered locomotion
Although his aunt scolded him for wasting time, we are told that he neverthe- less ‘developed the steam engine and rendered meritorious services
Th is very attractive woodblock print was one of a series distributed by the Japanese Min- istry of Education during the early Meiji period
It dates from about 1870
Th is was a time when Japan was opened up to Western science and technology, and evidently to its mythologies also
Keiko Suzuki explains that the message of such ‘enlightenment pictures (Kaika-e) was about persistence and of diffi  culties overcome
Th ey presented symbols of Western culture
Together with writings of the time they blended Smilesian self-help and utility ‘with traditional Con- fucian stoicism and Samurai self-reliance as a role model for Japanese youth
Whether in Greenock or in Tokyo, the urging of industrial development and tales of Watts kettle are never far apart
Figure(1)

Returning to recent times, I fi nd that Watt and the kettle are a popular refer- ence point in sermons, oft en coupled with Robert the Bruce and his spider or Newton and his apple
One such sermon, delivered in Arkansas in 2001, quoted from a book by William Barclay, Th e Gospel of Luke: ‘“Many people saw steam raise the lid of a kettle; only James Watt went on to think of a steam engine
Many people saw an apple fall; only Isaac Newton went on to think of the law of grav- ity”
Th e preacher continued: ‘We might add that many people saw a shepherd return home with a lost sheep draped over his shoulders, but only Jesus went on to think of Gods loving providence
Not only God but also Mammon has been served by the story
It has been widely used in advertising, on one occasion in developing a campaign for the company L(1) Th e advertisement is about see- ing things diff erently on the ‘Flatron fl at-screen television just as Watt had seen things diff erently when he looked at the steaming kettle
Th e words in the steam ask, ‘Do you see a revolution here
Th e main text of the advertisement responds: ‘Revolution in a kettle
(1)(2) James Watt saw it
He saw the steam engine in it
And laid the foundation for the great Industrial (1)(2) A little extra zeal to see things diff erently, and a revolution is on hand
Finally we are advised: ‘Expand your life
Over the years Watt and the kettle have helped to sell, among many things, whisky, nuclear energy and, perhaps more predictably, steam boilers
Similar evangelical fervour characterizes management literature on innova- tion and its injunctions to ‘think outside the square
Richard Farson, in his aptly titled book Management of the Absurd (1996) describes how James Watt suppos- edly saw something that millions of other people had also seen but ‘not seen
It was, Farson claims, Watts observation of how steam coming from his tea kettle could be used to power steam engines that sparked the Industrial (1)(2)
Watt also saw the ‘invisible obvious that so many others could not
I am not, needless to say, endorsing the interpretations here, but simply illustrating the ubiquity of the myth and the fact that the kettle inspiration is so oft en depicted as somehow giving Watt the idea of steam power in toto
My favourite piece of secular literature that invokes Watt and the kettle is the ‘Penguins sketch in Episode 38 of Monty Pythons Flying (1)(2) It begins with the words of the presenter, played by John Cleese, whose manic hyperbole, pro- gressively contradicting itself, captures beautifully our cultural confusion over the role of accident, genius and hard work in discovery and invention
However, when Cleese comes to the Watt anecdote we are told: ‘James Watt watched an ordinary household kettle boiling and conceived the potentiality of steam power(1) Even the most literate and, in other respects, perceptive of modern popular invocations of the myth treat it as being about Watts discovery of the power of steam
Th ese few examples of the deployment of the myth of Watt and the kettle show that the story is ubiquitous, that it has a number of variants and that, most commonly, it simply makes the connection between steam and power
Its telling oft en involves the old canards that Watt invented the steam engine or that he was the fi rst to see the potential of steam power
Th e story is sometimes told with great earnestness
On other occasions it is recounted with a view to defl ating or ridicul- ing it
Th e myth is modifi ed creatively, it is perpetuated, and it is ‘busted
In fact, busting the myth is very popular
Only clerics, management gurus and comedians seem to take it seriously as a piece of history
Works for juveniles are sometimes very careful in using the story
Neil Champions biography of Watt for young peo- ple, for example, tells the tale and reproduces a nineteenth-century painting by Marcus Stone depicting the young Watt contemplating steam (of which more in a moment)
Champion warns, however, that the story may not be true
So where did the myth come from
Let us look at its history in both word and image
On 14 May 1845, James Patrick Muirhead wrote to James Watt Jr from Hano- ver Square in London describing a painting that he had just seen in an exhibition at the Royal Academy of (1)(2) Th e painting, number 673 in the catalogue of the exhibition, was by Robert (1) Buss and titled ‘Watts First Experiment on Steam
Muirhead noted that the catalogue cited a passage from François Aragos Eloge of James Watt ‘in which the anecdote is given of his watching, in the presence of his Aunt Miss Muirhead the escape and condensation of steam from a tea kettle
Figure 1
(1)(1) Buss, ‘Watts First Experiment on Steam
Engraved by James (1)(2) (Copyright ©

He was descended from her brother, whilst her sister was the mother of James (1)(2) Muirhead, who gave up a legal career and became in eff ect a literary aide-de-camp to Watt Jr, had translated Aragos Eloge of Watt into English in 1839
Th ere he rendered Aragos telling of the anecdote of the kettle as follows: Sitting one evening with his aunt, (1)(2) Muirhead, at the tea table, she said, ‘James Watt, I never saw such an idle boy; take a book or employ yourself usefully; for the last hour you have not spoken one word, but taken off  the lid of that kettle and put it on again, holding now a cup and now a silver spoon over the steam, watching how it rises from the spout, and catching and connecting the drops it falls into, are you not ashamed of spending your time this way
… (1)(2) Muirheads reproof will present itself to our minds under a totally diff erent aspect; the little James before the tea-kettle, becomes the mighty engineer preluding to the discoveries which were to immortalise him…
An engraving of the picture that Buss exhibited that day is reproduced in Figure 1
As Muirhead noted, the picture is clearly based on the passage from Ara- gos Eloge of Watt: the personnel involved are Watt and his aunt; the young Watt has his hand on the tea kettle as if performing some of the operations that Arago described, and his aunt is wielding a watch measuring the time that she thinks Watt is wasting
Note, however, that in itself the Buss painting does not refl ect that part of the anecdote concerning the condensation of steam
Th e cup and the spoon are not being wielded, though they do lie there on the table
Th e painting is most likely to be read as showing the young Watt discerning the power, not the properties, of steam
Having seen the painting, Muirheads immediate reaction was amusement, as he described it to Watt Jr: Th e picture is not so bad as we thought it likely to be, and I even heard it called ‘very clever by one critic
James Watt you are to know was then a good looking boy in a purple velvet coat (
) and Miss Muirhead a stiff  and stately old dame with a very pretty tea:service of Japan china and an old fashioned watch on which she indig- nantly pointed out the time that her nephew had wasted
Muirhead was evidently amused by the sartorial and domestic licence taken by the artist
Nevertheless he found a ‘distant resemblance between Miss Muirhead as depicted and the portrait of her sister (Watt Jrs grandmother) that hung in Watt Jrs dining room, ‘although, as was natural to expect, Muirhead added rather ungal- lantly, ‘the married sister greatly excels the unmarried one in attractions
Later, in his Life of Watt, published in 1858, Muirhead recounted the anecdote again, and there, for reasons we shall shortly examine, he vouched for its accuracy
For him this anecdote was no myth but a reliable account of a real incident
In 1863, some twenty years aft er the exhibition of Busss painting, another artwork was executed, ‘Watt Discovers the Condensation of Steam by Mar- cus (1)(2)30 Th is rather attractive genre painting has been widely reproduced (see Figure 1
)
It represents a very diff erent scene from that painted by (1)(2)
Young Watt is still playing with the kettle, but this time he is pictured holding a spoon in the steam rather than fi ddling with the lid
Th e scene is not at his aunts house but rather in his own home
Th e young Watt is seated at the table with his mother and father
Th e boy who has left  the table and gone to serve a cus- tomer, is almost certainly Jamess brother (1)(2) Like his father, John inhabited the marine and mercantile world, as represented in the shopfront annexed to the domestic quarters
John died at sea at the age of twenty-three
In contrast with this active world, and with the drudgery of the maid who also has her back to him, Watt the child occupies a contemplative space in his reverie on steam
Th e parents attention is on their strange son
Th ey appear fascinated yet perplexed by their off spring, fi xed in an attitude of uncomprehending devotion
Gone is the scolding aunt
Th e adults here, far from reproving the child for wasting time, appear to be admiring his genius
It is also notable that whilst the young Watt in Busss painting is plausibly an errant teenager, the Watt in Stones version is younger, almost cherubic
He is innocently open to the inspiration coming his way(1) Many subsequent renderings of the myth of the kettle derive from Stones painting insofar as they depict Watt at home with his mother
Th e painting also seems to have inspired a play for young people published in 1936, at the time of the Watt bicentenary, called ‘Letting off  Steam
Th is is a charming little drama, set around the Watt family hearth
It was undoubtedly performed in schools in the UK to mark the 200th anniversary of Watts birth

] Th e images are seductive, but let us return to the words
So far we have traced the myth back to François Aragos Eloge of James Watt published in 1839
Where did Arago get the story
In fact he obtained it from James Watt (1)(2) In 1834, Arago visited Britain to attend the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in (1)(2) His other prime purpose during the trip was to collect material for the Eloge of Watt that he was due to deliver to the Académie des Sciences at the end of that year
Th us began a long correspondence and a series of meetings between Arago and James Watt Jr about the Eloge that lasted until its long-delayed publication in 1839 and beyond
Th e story of Watt and the kettle was one among many pieces of information that Watt Jr commu- nicated to Arago in the wake of his visit
A version of the kettle story was sent to Arago fi rst in late October 1834 in a copy of a letter received by Watt Jr from Dr James (1)(2) Gibson, who was married to Agnes, a daughter of Watt Jrs sister Margaret, had received anecdotes of the young Watt from a Miss Jane Campbell, of whom more in a moment
He knew that Watt Jr was seeking material on his fathers early life to send to (1)(2) Gibsons letter told the story thus: When a boy at school he [Watt] had not robust health whereupon the School Master recommended him to be withdrawn for a time & sent to the country to recover his health – while the elders were at table the subject of this éloge was found sitting by the parlour fi re holding a plate (which he had fi lched off  the table) to the spout of the boiling tea kettle noticing carefully the distances at which the steam condensed when it came in contact with the cold plate – who can say but this gave him fi rst the idea of the power & elasticity of steam
– Th is is not exactly the way Miss Jane Campbell told the story but the facts are the same
Th is was probably the version of the story that Arago used in his spoken éloge, delivered to the Académie in December 1834
Watt Jr wrote directly to the source of these anecdotes, Miss Jane Campbell, and learned that she had received them from her mother, Mrs Marion Camp- bell, a cousin of James Watt who had spent much time with him as a child
In fact the anecdotes had been dictated to Jane Campbell by her mother in 1798
Miss Campbell now sent a copy to James Watt Jr for Aragos information
So it was that in January 1835 Watt Jr wrote fi rst to Aragos ‘minder (1) (1) Pentland and then to Arago himself with news of this material
Watt Jr explained to Pent- land that the anecdotes had been written down some time ago
Although Miss Campbell had oft en told them to him, he was unaware until recently that they had been written down so early: ‘from what I know from other sources, I can vouch for the authenticity of every word of it
It shows my father to have been ab incepto the same in talent & disposition, he continued to the end of his life
Mr Arago cannot do better in revising that part of his memoir, than to adopt every word of it in a literal translation
A few days later Watt Jr wrote to Arago sending a copy of Miss Campbells (1)(2) Watt Jr was again anxious to emphasize the authenticity of the material: Mrs Campbell was fi rst cousin to my father, being a daughter of his Mothers brother, Mr Muirhead, who was a builder and timber merchant in (1)(2) She was nearly my fathers age, and they were brought up a good deal together at the houses of their respective parents
I knew her in aft er life, as a person of strong sense and clear judge- ment and possessing an aff ectionate esteem for my father
She was fully aware of the High estimation he had then attained, and it now appears she committed to her daughters care this record of her recollections of his early years, which probably even at that time (in 1798), she was the only person capable of giving
Once again Watt Jr urged Arago to use the entire ‘authentic narrative in place of the earlier version
Let me focus now on precisely what was received from Miss Campbell and what was sent to Arago and used in other printed recountings of the story
Th ere is some diffi  culty is consulting the communications between Watt Jr and his cousin Miss Jane Campbell for the simple reason that in March 2003 the manuscripts were sold at Sothebys in London and their current whereabouts are unknown
Fortunately the catalogue of the sale gives us considerable detail about the ‘kettle documents including a facsimile of part of the original Memo- randa from Miss Campbell to Watt (1)(2)38 Here, unsurprisingly, we fi nd the central element of the story of the kettle and the scolding aunt and also a brief refl ection upon the story
On examining this document closely, however, it became appar- ent that the original words, in Miss Campbells hand, had been edited, if ever so slightly (see Figure 1
)
Th e word ‘power had been struck through and the word ‘properties written above it
In transcribing the manuscript, the Sothebys catalogue quite happily uses ‘properties, as if the correction had simply set right a slip of a single pen
I believe, however, that we are dealing with more than a Figure 1

mistake here
Th e change is identifi ably in Watt Jrs hand
Watt Jr did not sim- ply transmit the anecdote from Miss Campbell to Arago, he modifi ed it
In  fact, I believe that he considered himself to be rendering it truer in so doing
Let  us compare the original statement in the Memorandum with the statement as  modifi ed by Watt (1)(2) Th e original states: ‘It appears that when thus blamed for  idleness, his active mind was employed in investigating the power of steam
Watt  Jrs version substituted ‘the properties of steam for ‘the power of steam
Th e word ‘power would have struck Watt Jr as inappropriate
Aft er all, the  power of steam had been demonstrated long before his fathers day
Watt did not  invent the application of steam power to practical purposes
He improved that  application by, among other things, greatly increasing the duty of steam engines
Th at increased duty was due largely to his invention of the separate condenser
Th e separate condenser, in turn, was inspired by his fathers independent experi- ments on the properties of steam
Th is, I suggest, was why Watt Jr made this  alteration in Miss Jane Campbells (1)(2)40 Th e intent of the alteration,  if not the exact words, was conveyed in the published version of Aragos (1)(2)  Th e exact words, as corrected by Watt Jr, were reproduced in Muirheads Life of  James Watt, published in 1858
When Watt Jr made this modifi cation of the kettle story he had already been  long engaged in a fi ght to try to secure his fathers priority over Henry Cav- endish and Antoine Lavoisier as discoverer of the composition of water
Watt  himself, in 1784, had expressed great resentment about the way he, and his ideas,  had been treated by these two prominent natural philosophers
His son shared  these concerns even as his fathers anger cooled
Th e ‘water controversy was to  explode again in a second phase in the late 1830s and 1840s as a direct result  of the claims put forward on Watts behalf, with Watt Jrs connivance, in Ara- gos (1)(2)41 It might be tempting to conclude that, in emphasizing properties of  steam, Watt Jr was making a direct move in support of his fathers claims to the  discovery of the composition of water
Th is is all the more tempting because, as  we will see, Watts real investigations of steam were directly connected with his  ideas on water
Th ere were reasons, however, why Watt Jr did not want to make  that direct connection publicly
Th is tactical omission is discussed further below
I believe that in altering the kettle story Watt Jrs main objective was to make  a claim about his fathers experimental (and therefore philosophical) approach  to the improvement of the steam engine and, in particular, to assert his fathers  independence of Joseph Black in that regard
Of course, insofar as this estab- lished Watts scientifi c credentials and capacities it did support his case in the  ‘water controversy in a general sense
However, in modifying the anecdote Watt  Jr almost certainly had the propagation of ideas about the relationship between the kettle and the separate condenser in mind
Th e question of the scientifi c basis of Watts major technical improvement of the steam engine, the separate condenser, is, of course, a classic bone of con- tention among historians and has involved generations of interpretation and counter-interpretation
Some historians, convinced that the technologies of the fi rst industrial revolution were largely the product of empirics, have depicted Watt as a talented, hard-working craft sman who owed little to scientifi c investi- gations
(1) (1) Hall, who reserved the term ‘science for generalized, theoretical knowledge, claimed that Watt had only a veneer of science that did not mean- ingfully inform his works of invention
Th us Hall states: It is easy to overlook the fact that while particular facts and ad hoc correlations may be no more than awkward or intriguing to a scientist, they may be quite suffi  cient to permit an engineer or technologist to take an important step; conversely generaliza- tion, essential to science, may be a feeble prop for the practitioner
Th e literate and sophisticated engineer, like Watt, may enjoy his use of scientifi c labels and his mastery of scientifi c rationalization while always actually working with particular facts and ideas
Any scientifi c theory may envelop his actual immersion in particulars
Others, notably Musson and Robinson, have stressed the scientifi c nature of Watts work, oft en by indicating his reliance upon, or at least his close association with, Blacks researches on heat
Most recently Margaret Jacob and Larry Stewart have endorsed this view on broader grounds
In much modern scholarship the bound- aries between science/technology and between rhetoric/practice are not seen as being so readily drawn, if drawable at all
Th e contingent processes whereby such boundaries are constructed have become, for many, the object of study
In the later nineteenth and early twentieth century, attitudes among writers on his life to the kettle myth fl uctuated with regard to the salience that they gave to Watts scientifi c credentials
Th at is, those who promoted an image of Watt as an ingenious, hard-working craft sman, rather than as a philosopher, tended to debunk the kettle ‘myth
Th us Samuel Smiles, whilst recounting the story, disagreed with Aragos claim that it was authentic
Smiles pronounced the young Watt of the story as likely to have been ‘as idle as he seems
Smiles was also infl uential in bringing a ‘counter-iconography into prominence
In his later years, Watt had spent many hours in a workshop that he built for himself at Heathfi eld (1)(2) Smiles gave this prominence in his accounts of Watts life
He was eff ectively developing an image of Watt that projected the old craft sman of the Heathfi eld Hall workshop backwards, rather than the young philosopher of the kettle myth forwards, in time
A similar trend towards the craft sman view and away from the scientist or philosopher view of Watt is detectable in encyclo- paedia articles on the great man in the late nineteenth century
For example, the new edition of Chamberss Encyclopaedia in the 1890s systematically removed material from the article on Watt that had appeared in earlier editions and had created the impression of Watt as a ‘scientist
Among the diff erences was that early editions contained a detailed account of Watts steam experiments, but the 1895 edition removed this and simply stated that Watt ‘hit upon the expedient  of the separate condenser
As already noted the trend can be seen in the device- centred statues of Watt that became popular in the later nineteenth century
Th e celebrations in 1919 of the centenary of Watts death prominently featured  Watts workshop, which was subsequently presented to the Science Museum  when Heathfi eld Hall was demolished in 1924
Th ere it remains as testimony  to the image of Watt the craft sman
Serious scholarship backed this image of  Watt and discounted the kettle myth
Th e foremost scholar on Watt in the early  twentieth century, (1) (1) Dickinson, in his book James Watt, Craft sman and Engineer, had this to say about the kettle story: If an artist ever wishes to paint a genre picture of Watt, instead of perpetuating the unfounded story of his playing as a boy with the steam issuing from the spout of a kettle, he might limn the young workman in his leathern apron with the separate condenser on his lap
Whatever may have been the later cultural vicissitudes of the kettle storys plau- sibility, Watt himself, and his son, certainly claimed a scientifi c basis for Watts improvements
Th ey also claimed that the philosophical approach was Watts own, independent work and not dependent, except in a general sense, on Joseph (1)(2) What better way to do this than to put investigation of the properties of steam into the young Watts mind, some years before he even met Black, so that they were there all along, merely surfacing and fi nding their fullest expression in the mature Watts experiments on steam
So Watt Jr sought to constrain the interpretation of the anecdote in this way
We remain with an important question – what kind of investigation was Watts inquiry into the properties of steam
Th e word ‘properties could refer to physical or to chemical ones
Few if any would jump to the latter conclusion in the nineteenth century because by then Watts chemistry, at least in relation to the steam engine, was treated as an irrelevance
We can be confi dent that for a scientifi cally literate nineteenth-century audience, the precocious Watt of the kettle story was prefi guring, if anything, the adult Watts physical investigations of steam – his insight into thermal laws and, later in the century, his prescience with regard to the laws of ‘energy and ‘thermodynamics
Tracing the Indicator What was the signifi cance of the indicator held in the hand of the Watt statue unveiled at Greenock by Andrew Carnegie
(See Figure 1
) To understand this we need to trace aspects of the history of that commemoration and also of the indicator itself in the nineteenth century
Th e Greenock statue was sculpted by Henry Charles (1)(2)49 It was the second Watt statue that Fehr had produced, the fi rst being erected in Leeds City Square in 1898
It was noted at the time of the design of the Greenock statue and build- ing that ‘A bronze statue of Watt (which, except in one small detail, is a replica of one erected at Leeds) will be erected
Inspection of the two statues shows that the ‘one small detail in which they were diff erent could only be the replacement of the dividers held in the right hand of the Leeds statue by the indicator held in that of the ‘replica
It appears that Fehr fulfi lled his Greenock commission by making this substitution
Th e fact that the substitution was described by the Greenock Telegraph as a ‘small detail, together with the failure of the same paper to remark on the device, even though it featured prominently in the drawing of the statue that it published on the day of its unveiling, might suggest that little signifi cance was attached to the indi- cator
Equally, it might be contended that the reproduction of the Leeds statue except in that detail is a sign that someone made a defi nite decision that the indicator would be particularly apposite for (1)(2) Th is suggests, then, that the substitu- tion was signifi cant
To this point, however, I have found no historical records of discussions of the question between any of the key actors, namely the sculptor, the architect, the Memorial Committee, the Council and Carnegie himself
Figure 1
Andrew Carnegie unveils the Watt Statue at the Opening of the Watt Memorial Engineering and Navigation School, Greenock, 1 June 1908
Carnegie stands beneath the statue
Note the top-hatted gentlemen at the front of the audience and the fl at-capped workers at the rear
(Reproduced from the Greenock Telegraph, 6 June 1908, p(1), which reproduces it from a photograph by (1) (1) Jones) Another point supporting the view that considerable thought and particular intent was involved in the inclusion of the indicator has to do with the actual design of the indicator placed in Watts hand
It is recognizably a model dating from the very last years of the eighteenth or the early nineteenth centuries
Th e model depicted is what was known as a ‘recording indicator since it features the platen and weight introduced in the improved design by Watts assistant John Southern in 1796
It is similar to an indicator in the Science Museum collec- tion, which probably dates from between 1820 and 1840
(See Figure 6
) All this allows us to conclude that Fehr made an attempt at historical accuracy
Th is suggests again that the inclusion of the indicator was not a desultory act but a calculated one
Ray McKenzie reaches the same conclusion in his investiga- tions, arguing from the statues uniqueness: It is the only known monument to Watt that departs from the conventional practice of signifying his achievement through one of three common and easily recognized attributes – a pair of dividers, a steam cylinder or a governor mechanism – and thus relates directly to the business of the school to which it is attached
So, assuming that equipping Watt with an indicator was a meaningful act rather than a random one, what meanings did it convey to the top-hatted gentlemen at the front of the crowd at the unveiling and to the fl at-capped workers at the rear
Th e history of the indicator,55 and an examination of writings about it in the nineteenth century suggest that two sorts of conception of the device could Figure 1
Watt Statue, Watt Memorial Engineering and Navigation School, Greenock, showing Indicator in Watts Right (1)(2) (Authors photo) have been present in the minds of the spectators that day and would have been presented to the students of the Watt Memorial School in its early days
Th e fi rst conception is of the indicator as a ‘stethoscope
Manuals on the indicator and its use, which were published in signifi cant numbers in the nine- teenth century,56 devoted much attention to the indicator as a diagnostic tool
In depicting it as the stethoscope of the steam engineer they conveyed both the scientifi c basis of indicator usage and the element of ‘art professedly involved
Just as the experienced medical practitioner might divine much about the condi- tion of a patient beyond the textbook accounts of symptoms, so the experienced steam engineer might see deeply into the workings of engines and be able to diagnose all manner of ‘ailments in the machinery
It was thus entirely pos- sible that the practical engineers in the crowd at the Greenock unveiling would have recognized in their memorialized, indicator-wielding townsman the sort of craft sman-engineer that Samuel Smiles had emphasized and that the early twen- tieth century increasingly favoured
Th is would have pleased Carnegie too, since he liked the notion of Watt as a practical, self-made man, and promoted that image in the biography of Watt that he had recently published
In fact Carnegie had insisted that the values of self-suffi  ciency and hard work be refl ected in the way that funds were raised for the (1)(2)
On the other hand, representatives from the University of Glasgow (of whom there were a number present)59 would have seen other signifi cances in the memorial
Scions of the University, the home of Kelvin and other great develop- ers of thermodynamics would associate the indicator and the indicator diagram with the scientifi c triumphs of the development of thermodynamics in which local scientifi c heroes of later generations had played such a large part
For them the indicator-wielding Watt would have represented a crucial precursor of the pinnacle of science-based engineering (and engineering-based science) of the century just past
No one would have seen the indicator as I will argue Watt originally saw it, that is, as a chemical device
Th e overall eff ect of these representations of Watt in statuary and in the story of the kettle was to help to create what I call the ‘mechanical Watt
Th ese images powerfully reinforced the textual generation of the mechanical Watt, a process that I will chart in the next two chapters, and ensured that the ‘chemical Watt remained hidden from view
Th e mechanical Watt came in two fl avours
Some tried to construct Watt as a ‘philosopher-engineer, maintaining that his work was philosophical in nature being based in experimental test and philosophical inquiry
One result of this was a tendency to fi nd in Watt characteristics that anticipated mid-nineteenth century philosophical engineering of the sort increas- ingly pursued in the universities
A major diffi  culty with this route was fi nding serious philosophical activity on Watts part other than his chemical work
Once his ‘archaic chemistry was discredited as natural philosophy there was little else by way of materials to build the philosophical (1)(2) Others promoted the image of the mechanical Watt as craft sman-engineer
Th is was an idea seized upon by Smiles, which men of the lower and middle orders of society found appealing
Proponents of both versions of the mechanical Watt were unaware of, or aban- doned, his chemistry as the centrepiece of his work and marginalized it
I seek to revive the ‘chemical Watt
Th ere are two aspects to the textual production of the mechanical Watt – the marginalization of his chemistry, and the construction of him as an engineer
Th e shunting of his chemistry to one side came about partly through Watts self- fashioning and partly as a result of the well-known ‘water controversy in which the rival claims of Watt and Henry Cavendish to the title of discoverer of that central chemical fact, the compound nature of water, were asserted and fought over
Th e irony is that not only Watts opponents but also his supporters in that controversy were involved in disguising his chemical persona, one by granting too little to it, the other by granting too much
– 33 – 2 THE DEMISE OF THE ‘CHEMICAL WATT IN  THE NINETEENTH CENTURY During the course of the nineteenth century Watts chemical work and its importance to his improvements of the steam engine were eff ectively obscured
Th ere was a signifi cant disjunction between public characterizations of Watt in the late eighteenth and very early nineteenth centuries and those extant by the early twentieth
As Watts early reputation developed and grew, contemporary sources frequently identifi ed him as a chemist and recognized the relevance of his chemical work to the steam engine improvements
By the early twentieth century, however, Watts chemistry had passed from view
Th is is readily seen in the events and publications that celebrated the one-hundredth anniversary of his death in 1919 and the two hundredth anniversary of his birth in 1936
So, by some process, during the course of the nineteenth century the recognition of the chemical basis of Watts steam engine improvements, especially of the fi rst phase of them involving the separate condenser, evaporated
What was that process
A central element in this process was the ‘water controversy concerning whether Watt, Cavendish or Lavoisier should be recognized as the discoverer of the compound nature of water
I have examined this controversy, and the forces that drove it, in considerable detail elsewhere
In this chapter I focus on the way in which the controversy, together with Watts ‘self-fashioning in the later years of his life, radically transformed Watts chemical reputation and in particular determined the extent to which he was recognized as a chemist at all
Watt engaged in considerable recasting of his achievement in the years between about 1800 and his death in 1819
During the very early nineteenth century important investigations were being conducted which began to ques- tion the material theory of heat, and, even more acutely, the role of heat as a chemical substance
Th ese were key ideas upon which Watt had built his original understanding of steam and of the steam engine
More particularly, from around 1790, a number of investigators, including Agustin de Bétancourt, Gaspard de Prony and John Dalton, conducted and published steam experiments, which in terms of methods, results and interpretation presented challenges to Watts own
I believe that Watt, with aid and impetus from James Watt Jr and other mem- bers of ‘team Watt, consciously sought to adjust to these developments and to reshape the image of him that passed to posterity
Part of that process was to downplay the direct role of chemistry in the steam engine story and to recast it in a form more compatible with trends that were weakening the chemical inter- pretation of heat
Although the theory of heat as motion rather than material substance, advocated very early in the century by the likes of Benjamin Th omp- son, Count Rumford and Humphry Davy, was long resisted, it did stimulate important shift s of opinion on the chemical role of heat, and especially of latent heat
Th e latter concept began to be dragged free of its original theoretical moor- ings to some extent, thanks especially to the increasing popularity of ‘Irvinist ideas,2 and the work of the so-called ‘Manchester School around John (1)(2)
Watts own narrative accounts of his steam engine improvements were the main vehicle through which the recasting took place
One key narrative became widely available through its publication in an edi- tion of John Robisons works in 1822
Another was the so-called ‘Plain Story of Watts improvements of the steam engine, which emerged from the archives through the writings of (1) (1) Muirhead in the mid-nineteenth century
From that point these accounts served nineteenth-century authors, and modern historians, as apparently compelling evidence ‘from the horses mouth of how the steam engine improvements had been accomplished
But these documents diverge in a number of important respects
Most notably Robisons account gives consid- erable play to Watts steam experiments, whilst the ‘Plain Story does not
Th e former account found use in the characterization of Watt as a natural philoso- pher of the steam engine, while the latter one encouraged and supported the craft sman view of him
Th e reasons for these divergences become apparent when we learn the history and prehistory of the respective documents
Th ey were the public survivors of a long line of documents produced by Watt giving accounts of his inventions
By showing that these documents were part of a conscious casting and recasting of Watts activities, involving deliberate, but not always consistent, attempts to shape his reputation in particular circumstances, I question their value and veracity if treated as transparent historical sources
Even as the keepers of the Watt fl ame downplayed the role of chemistry in the steam engine improvements themselves by, essentially, redescribing his chemis- try as ‘physics, or the pursuit of ‘thermal laws, they maintained, indeed asserted, Watts claim to one of the central discoveries of the Chemical Revolution – the compound nature of water
Th is eventually provoked the ‘water controversy, which reached its climax in the 1840s and 1850s
Th e Watt camp was trying to claim a portion of chemical fame for the great man
However, there was no paradox involved here because the chemical fame that was sought for Watt was treated as distinct from his great ‘engineering achievement
Th e fi nal outcome of the water controversy was that Watts chemical claims became not merely dis- tinct from his engineering achievements, but eff ectively extinct
A Disjunction Demonstrated Early characterizations of Watt as a chemist extended at least to the early phases of his monumental and textual canonization as the ‘mechanical Watt
Th is pic- ture of him is a little-remarked feature of the panegyric surrounding the
meeting at which the subscription was opened for the monument in Westmin- ster (1)(2) We have noted that Sir Humphry Davy in his speech to the meeting emphasized Watts chemical credentials
Th omas Hodgskin, writing in the Chemist, was clear on the point: (1)(2) Watt was not only a mechanic, he was also a chemist; and we are proud of the opportunity to hold up the honours bestowed on him, as an encouragement to our youthful readers
As was happily explained at the Meeting by Sir Humphrey Davy, (1)(2)
Watts ‘Discoveries were not owing to chance, but were founded on delicate and refi ned experiments connected with the discoveries as to heat, of (1)(2) (1)(2) He was equally distinguished (he said) as a natural philosopher and a chemist; and his fi rst important discoveries were made in chemistry; and his fi rst important invention was an application of chemical principles to steam-engines
His great mechanical improvements in them only began at a later period
In 1769, he took out a patent for lessening the consumption of fuel in steam-engines; and it was not till 1780 that he found the method of applying the movement of the pistons in straight lines to wheels and mill work
Hodgskin here makes explicit the claim that the Watt who took out the
patent was operating as a chemist
What enabled him to reduce fuel consump- tion in steam engines was a clever ‘application of chemical principles based on his delicate and refi ned experiments
Th e account of Watt in 1803 in Public Characters, though it did not go into much technical detail, described Watt as mechanic and chemist
It is likely that George Chalmers was referring to Watt when, in his 1794 discussion of the role of knowledge in economic growth he symbolized the knowledge input in terms of the contributions of ‘a chemist in Birmingham, a potter in Staff ord, and a millwright in Manchester, who, by their genius, have counteracted the expence and folly of the American war
Th e trilogy to which he referred, I suggest, consisted of Watt, Wedgwood and Arkwright, and in Watts case the clear implication was that the improvement of the steam engine was attributable to the ‘chemist of Birmingham
At about the same time as Chalmers wrote this, Watt and his lawyers were preoccupied with a series of trials in which they challenged the engine ‘pirates who, they argued, were stealing a legitimately patented invention
In the course of these trials the pirates defended themselves by challenging the validity of the 1769/75 patent
In that legal context too, one line of attack by the Watt camp was to emphasize the importance of recognizing the chemical nature of Watts improvements in the steam engine in his 1769 patent
When Boulton & Watt took ‘engine pirates to court for infringement of their patent, the latter defended themselves in various ways, but the chief defence involved asserting that the patent was invalid because of the insuffi  ciency of the patent specifi - cation
A patent specifi cation was supposed to supply enough information to enable someone ‘skilled in the art to construct the device or adopt the process in question
Th e claim of the defendants was that Watts patent specifi cation was inadequate because it did not include any mechanical drawings explaining the detailed construction of an improved steam engine
Th e Boulton & Watt law- yers responded by arguing that the patent was not taken out on a specifi c engine but on a principle of arrangement
It is important to realise that later stipulations that principles could not be patented were only in embryo in the 1790s
In fact the Boulton & Watt patent trials were to be important in the establishment of the precise nature of those stipulations
In the course of developing their cases the Boulton & Watt lawyers thoroughly investigated precedents in chemical patents and sought to assimilate the Watt patent to those precedents
Mr Ser- jeant Adair put it this way in addressing the judge and jury in Boulton & Watt v
Hornblower and Maberley in 1796: I will … recall your attention to that in which the invention did consist in order to shew you in what it does not consist
It did consist in an attention to the chemical principles and properties of steam by which the causes of the defects in Newcomens Engine as well as the remedies were suggested…
In subsequent discussions of the problematic status of Watts patent as a patent of principle, the principle in question has been reinterpreted as simply that of arranging an engine spatially so as to have a separate condenser
Th is is how the principle was enshrined in drawings of the Watt engine, including the drawing we saw in the lap of Chantreys marble statues of (1)(2) Because of this the origins of the idea in chemical principles have been lost sight of
Other eighteenth-century sources that reveal the chemical Watt are the arti- cles written on ‘Steam and the ‘Steam Engine for the Encyclopaedia Britannica by his old friend John Robison, who was a regular companion of Watt during the period that his improvements on the steam engine were made
Robison stated of this time: ‘I had not yet studied chemistry, and (1)(2) Watt was my fi rst instructor … I was more assiduous in my attendance on (1)(2) Watts occupations than ever, and studied the little model as much as he did
Th e latter is a reference, of course, to the model Newcomen Engine that, in the standard story, stimulated the train of experiments and reasoning that led to Watts improvements
Th e implication is that in those improvements Watt was the chemical adept and Robison the stu- dent
Th e emphasis on chemistry remains throughout
When Robison referred to the numberless unsuccessful attempts to improve Watts engine he found part of the reason for their failure to be that ‘Our engineers by profession are in general miserably defi cient in that accurate knowledge of mechanics and of chemistry, which is necessary for understanding this machine
Ultimately, the main way in which Robison placed Watt in a chemical tradition was by describing him as a pupil of Joseph Black working in the Blackian tradition of the chemistry of heat
We fi nd, then, many indications in late eighteenth- and very early nineteenth- century literature that Watts invention was widely understood and interpreted as based on a chemical understanding of steam
By the early twentieth century, however, things were very diff erent
We have the fl oor plan, and a detailed list of contents, of the exhibition held in the Bir- mingham Art Gallery in 1919, to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of Watts death
In it we fi nd no sign whatsoever of Watts chemistry
Th e sub- stantial, detailed, and apparently comprehensive, commemorative volume by Dickinson and Jenkins, marking that centenary but not published until 1927, is also notable for the absence, apart from one brief reference to the composition of water, of all but bibliographical references to that aspect of Watts work
Indeed, not only Watt the chemist but even Watt the philosopher-engineer, gained little exposure in early twentieth-century celebrations
In fact the image of Watt the craft sman engineer had been so thoroughly propagated that those seeking to use commemoration to boost the funding of pure science on the basis of its ultimate utility could fi nd little ideological value in Watt compared with a fi gure like (1)(2)
Th e Genesis and Function of Watts Invention Narratives Many histories of the steam engine and of Watts life appeal to his own account of his steam engine improvements in the ‘Plain Story and also in his notes to (1)(2)15 Th e great attraction of the ‘Plain Story is that it comes from Watt himself
It is usually taken as a straightforward, factual, uncomplicated telling of the real course of events
Hardly ever has the document been subjected to critical scrutiny or put into context
Remarkably, one of the few authors ever to put the ‘Plain Story in context, and cast some doubt upon its literal truth, was Robert Caird, the engineer and shipbuilder of Greenock, in his Watt Anniver- sary Address of 1910
In fact, the ‘Plain Story was an interested document with a particular purpose
It was originally produced for use in the patent trials of the 1790s and, as Caird puts it, Watt deliberately did himself ‘less than justice because he was concerned to show that ‘what he has not covered in his specifi ca- tions was not patentable as being matter of common knowledge
It was also just one of a number of narratives that Watt (and Boulton) produced in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
Th ough Watt maintained an air of diffi  dence so far as fame was concerned, egged on by Boulton and later by Watt Jr, he was in fact assiduous in his attention to these matters
As Hugh Torrens has suggested, ‘team Watt could be quite ruthless and determined in shaping, even directly doctoring, the historical record in the guise of ‘getting it straight
Watts tellings of the story of his steam engine improvements can be loosely divided into those provided before 1800, and those developed aft er
Prior to
the stories told were closely related to the actual business of securing and defend- ing the patents and selling steam engines
Th us, narratives were developed as part of the process of seeking from Parliament the extension of the patent
Th ey were used in gaining publicity in Cornwall, the important early market for Boulton & Watt engines
And they were deployed in the patent trials of the 1790s, where Watts famous ‘Plain Story originated
Aft er Watts retirement from the business in 1800 (and the expiry of the key patents at about the same time) the produc- tion of narratives continued unabated, but with shift ing purposes
Th ey were no longer intended to serve so directly the exigencies of business but increasingly to cement and preserve Watts reputation
Legacy and commerce remained linked of course, but not so tightly or urgently as in the earlier period
As early as 1774–5 Watt was developing public narratives of his invention as part of the process of persuading Parliament to extend the 1769 patent
Th is was crucial, certainly from Boultons point of view, to the viability of the Boulton & Watt partnership
An eight-page pamphlet was produced and distributed to Members of Parliament titled ‘An Account of James Watts Improvements upon the Steam or Fire Engine
Th e narrative form of this document we might call ‘the dispersal of ignorance
First it looks back upon the earliest fi re engines of Savery and Worcester, and back upon the Newcomen Engine, from the vantage point of the knowledge about steam that the writer possesses
Key facts about steam are provided – its vaporous, elastic and condensable nature; the variation of its boil- ing point with pressure and, most sophisticatedly, the fact that ‘the diff erences of the heats at which water boils under diff erent degrees of pressure, increase in a less proportion than the pressures themselves; so that a double pressure requires less than a double increase of heat
Th en the operation of the Savery Engine is described, the whole prefaced by a view of the knowledge then available and the use made, or not made, of it: Th e inventors of the fi re engine seem to have only known that steam was an uniform fl uid, unmixed with air, and capable of being reduced to water by being brought into contact with bodies colder than itself; and they do not seem to have attended to all the consequences of this property
Th e Newcomen Engine is then depicted as a largely inadvertent solution to some of the problems with Saverys engine
In particular, the advantage that ‘the cylinder is not made as cold as in Saverys construction, and therefore less steam is lost in fi lling it aft er condensation was ‘unforeseen by the inventor
Th e defects of the Newcomen Engine – notably the production of steam by injection-water boiling in vacuo, which steam resists the pressure of the atmosphere, and the ‘destruction of steam by the cold cylinder – were in part compensated for practically by engine operators, but not so well as they would have been if they ‘had known the true principles upon which their engine ought to have been constructed
Th e lack of prior experimental knowledge is presented as the key problem: so very few experiments had been made even upon the most essential part of the sub- ject, that the real bulk of water, when converted to steam of a given heat, remained unknown, until the author of these new improvements determined it in the year 1764
Th e opinions which had been entertained concerning its bulk before that time were much beyond the truth, and could by no means be deduced from the very inac- curate experiments which were pretended to have been made
Th e boiling of water in an exhausted receiver at low heats was known; but it was neither known what these heats were, nor what progression they observed under various pressures, before he made his experiments upon that subject
Th ese experiments pointed out the defects of the common steam engines, and the extent to which they were hurtful; but the means of avoiding them were not so obvious, and were the subject of much contem- plation and experiment, of which these new improvements are the result
Watts improvements, then, are depicted as being based upon his steam experi- ments
Th e claim to an extension of the patent is grounded in Watts virtue as an experimentalist, which brought understanding and placed improvement on a philosophical basis in contrast to earlier ignorance and even fraudulence
Th e form of argument that Watt used in gaining title to the improved steam engine he also deployed in eff orts to sell it
Th us the account written for Wil- liam Pryce, which was designed to sell the Boulton & Watt engine to Cornish mine owners, clearly drew on the earlier document
Mr Pryce, like the Members of Parliament, was treated to an account of Watts steam experiments and their superiority to prior work in showing that ‘the diff erences of ye heats at which water boils under diff erent degrees of pressure, increase in a less proportion than the pressures themselves: so that a double pressure requires less than a double increase of sensible heat
Further: Th e experiments which have been published concerning the bulk of water when con- verted into steam, are erroneous, & the opinions deduced from them make that bulk many times greater than it really is
Th at water boiled in an exhausted receiver at above degree of heats was known, but it was not known what these were nor what progression they followed under vari- ous pressures, untill Mr Watt determined them by a regular sett of experiments at the same time that he found the true bulk of steam … Th ese things being premised if we consider the common steam engine we shall fi nd it defective
Th us the narrative form here is that experiments on the properties of steam provide a basis on which the defects of the common steam engine (the New- comen engine) could be specifi ed
Th ese defects were then made good by Watts improvements
Th ose improvements thus also found their rationale, indeed their cause, in Watts steam experiments
(Th e perpetrator of the ‘erroneous experiments on the bulk of steam, though not named here, was (1)(2)
Th e critique of Desaguliers had been pursued in Cullens lectures
As Arthur Donovan observes, that critique had more than a little about it of the chemist chiding the mechanical philosopher
To the initiated, Watts statement here may well have been taken to echo such jurisdictional disputes, placing him fi rmly in the chemical camp)
A year aft er receiving this document from Watt, William Pryce published his Mineralogia Cornubiensis, in which he stated that the only improvement which has been made in the fi re engine for thirty years past, the public will justly attribute to the sagacity of (1)(2) Watt, whose skill in pneumatics, mechanics and hydraulics, is evidenced by the powerful application of elastic vapour, nearly like that of the barometer in his new constructed fi re engine
Pryce remarked favourably on Watts regular set of experiments and reported the economies claimed for the Watt engine without entirely endorsing the latter
All in all, though, Pryces book, which provided the fi rst public notice of the engine widely available in print, was a favourable piece of publicity for the Boulton & Watt engines at a time when their assault on the Cornish market was being hard fought
Richard Hills notes that Boulton, Watt, John Fothergill and Darwin were subscribers to Pryces book
Th ey were supporting, and endorsing, an account of the Boulton & Watt engines that Boulton and Watt had themselves provided
We should note that when Pryce recognized Watts achievement as drawing on ‘his skill in pneumatics, mechanics and hydraulics he was character- izing Watts experiments on steam as pneumatic chemistry
Further occasion for producing a narrative of Watts steam engine improve- ments was provided by a rather diff erent literary venture in 1789–90 when his friend and fellow ‘Lunatic, Erasmus Darwin, requested and received from Watt, and from Boulton, an account of the steam engine improvements for use in the epic poem, Th e Botanic (1)(2) In his letter to Watt, Darwin asked what the world might be told about ‘your improvements of the steam-engine or anything about your experiments, or calculated facts about the power of your engines, or any other ingenious stuff
Boultons response31 was typically direct, giving Darwin a ‘Catalogue of Facts that he could use as he pleased, detailing how Boulton & Watt engines diff ered from Newcomens
Th is reads very much like a marketing brochure, although Boulton also added detailed calculations supporting his contentions about the ‘convenience and properties of the improved engines
Watts response was very diff erent – long, diffi  dent, almost despairing
He sent Darwin a ten-page ‘dull History of Steam Engines, as he described it, and a covering letter full of signs of the ill-health and lack of ‘animal spirits that he diagnosed himself as suff ering
Th e ‘dull History was clearly composed with his earlier narratives at hand, espe- cially the pamphlet produced for Members of Parliament in 1774
Th e central account of his experiments in the mid-1760s and how those clarifi ed the failings of Newcomen engines was taken pretty directly from the earlier work
But this was prefaced by a long section on the earliest uses and understandings of steam among the ancients and in the seventeenth century
It was followed by the ‘per- fect engine narrative, in which the realization of that principle was satisfi ed by the idea of the separate condenser
Watts lack of spirits at the time perhaps inclined him to a remarkably diffi  - dent passage, even for him
Watt gave Darwin permission to edit the document he sent but asked that he bestow no personal praise – ‘in my own conscience I do not think I merit much praise
I am in fact a mere compilator
I have tacked and sewed together, the [serasso
] & remnants of many a mans ideas, altered & fi tted them to purposes he never thought of, but I have invented or discovered little
Interestingly, in line with this downplaying of the role of the individual, Watt included a passage at the end of his account of the steam engine narrative that strongly gestured towards deterministic ideas about invention
Referring to himself and Boulton he wrote: these Gentlemen owe much of their success to the accurate philosophy of the last age, to the enterprising spirit of the present age, to the opulence of this country & to the decline of prejudice & attachment to ancient [candour
]
Had they lived in another age or in some other country, they might have been mere theorists or have rubbed through life unknowing & unknown unless they had happened to turn their abilities to the contrivance of instruments for the destruction of the human species
Even as I argue that Watt tailored his various narratives to purpose, I acknowledge that, as in this instance, their chief purpose could on occasion be therapeutic
Needless to say, Darwin knew his friends tendency towards diffi  dence well and there was no sign of this determinism and self-eff acement in the published account
As we have already seen, in the 1790s, narratives of Watts steam engine improvements were produced in connection with the patent trials of that dec- ade in which Boulton & Watt confronted legally people whom they regarded as ‘pirates of their engines
John Robisons testimony in Boulton & Watt v
Horn- blower and Maberley was his fi rst venture into describing Watts route to the separate condenser
In the course of his testimony Robison emphasized the phil- osophical nature of Watts approach, saying that ‘all became science in his hands
Th e science concerned was chemistry
Th is was apparent not least from the close association that Robison depicted between Watt and Joseph (1)(2) Robison was useful in other ways when the suffi  ciency of the specifi cation was being tested in the court33 but Watts own aff adavit, which became the ‘Plain Story, took the narrative in a diff erent direction
Th e story that Watt told contains much circumstantial detail but the intent of it, given the context of the trial and of earlier legal contests, was to show that virtually all the mechanical contrivances that he employed were previ- ously known and used
Th e central novelty was the principle of the separate condenser, which in turn depended upon knowledge about the production, condensation and properties of steam
However, the ‘Plain Story played down the extent to which Watt himself had generated that knowledge
We have seen that other accounts detailed Watts own experiments at great length, but here there is only one mention of an experiment with steam by him, the rest being garnered from others: By a simple experiment, Watt found what was the real bulk of water converted into steam; and from his friend (1)(2) Black he learned what was the heat absorbed and ren- dered latent by the conversion of water into steam, which the Doctor then publicly taught, and had done for some years
Experiments had been made long before by (1)(2)
Cullen, (1)(2) John Robison, and others, in public classes, which proved that water, when placed in an exhausted receiver, boiled, and was converted into steam at the heat of 70º or 80º of Fahrenheits thermometer…
Th us Watts ‘Plain Story, because it was intended to support the argument that it was unnecessary and irrelevant to specify mechanical details in the specifi cation, opted for a simple account of the basis of the principle that was the core of the invention shorn of the chemical thinking and experimentation that engendered it
Most of the latter Watt portrayed as public knowledge attributable in the fi rst place to others
He invoked the idea of the requirements of a ‘perfect engine as his basic insight
Th e disjunction between the stories told by Watt and by Robison in the course of Boulton & Watt v
Hornblower and Maberley occurred despite Watts best eff orts to coach Robison about his testimony
Even as he asked Robison to appear as a witness Watt began the coaching, telling his old friend: ‘I did not invent this method piece meal but all at once in a few hours in 1765 I believe … all this was done in the day or two aft er I had contrived it, the other experiments you mention in the Encycla were aft erwards
It appears, then, that Watts story was ‘plain not just in the sense of being claimed ‘true but also in the sense of being simplifi ed
When compared with Watts earlier accounts, it downplays the extent and novelty of his steam experi- ments and shift s the weight towards the almost instantaneous conception of the principle of the perfect engine
To take the ‘Plain Story at face value as a simple historical description is a dangerous thing to do given that the story was constructed in a particular rhetorical context with specifi c legal objectives in mind
Once the patent trials were settled, the victory of Boulton & Watts engine business was more or less complete
Th ey dealt with the arrears owed to them, especially in Cornwall, recovering a very substantial sum
Th e original patent terminated in 1800
By this time, Watt Jr and Matthew Robinson Boul- ton were running the business aff airs of a reconfi gured company, Boulton, Watt & Co, the fortunes of which were now more dependent on the construction and sale of engines than on the exploitation of patents
For Watt in retirement, the focus in recounting the story of his great inventions shift ed to his place in history
Reputation, rather than direct commercial issues became the prime rea- son for carefully scrutinizing stories told about steam
Th e steam experiments re-emerged to greater prominence, when compared with the way that they had been pushed into the background in the ‘Plain Story
In fact, whereas in that story Watt had deferred to Black, in post-1800 accounts Watts independence of Black in making those experiments became a central issue once again
Philosophical Self-Fashioning in Retirement Th e publication of Joseph Blacks chemical lectures in 1803, under John Robi- sons editorship was an early occasion prompting Watt to ‘correct the historical record
Watt was unhappy, to say the least, with the dedication of that work to him in terms describing him as ‘Dr Blacks most illustrious pupil, whose improvements of the steam engine ‘you profess to owe to the instruction and information you received from Dr Black
Robison had made these claims in his contributions to the patent trials and, whilst generally grateful for Robisons help on that occasion, Watt did not like the way that his relations with Black had been depicted
Watt was adamant that he had not attended Blacks lectures, that he had arrived at the ‘facts of latent heat independently, and only learnt about Blacks prior discoveries when he presented those ‘facts to (1)(2) Th e issue of the relationship between Blacks work on heat and his own was an increasingly sensitive one for Watt, and not just because of the question of his philosophical independence
Th ere must have been uncertainty in Watts mind about the fate of his own and Blacks ideas in the face of new developments in the science of heat
Rumford and Davy were early in claiming experimental proof that heat was non-material, but it was to be mid-century before they were hailed as pointing the way forward
Th e early nineteenth-century situation was complex
Gold- farb argues that that period saw the development of intermediate theories of heat, which were neither straightforwardly material nor mechanical
Rumfords own theory was, it appears, eff ectively a wave theory of a sort widely discussed before the thermodynamic ‘revolution
We know, of course, that the concept of latent heat survived the vicissitudes of changing theories of heat in the nineteenth century
Black himself had been relatively non-committal on the ultimate nature of heat,40 but Watt had become fi rmly committed to a material theory in which heat was a chemical substance
Sticking to these early ideas would have been increasingly diffi  cult for Watt in the early nineteenth century
If we place ourselves in Watts shoes in the last twenty years of his life we can begin to see how the conceptions about heat upon which he had relied in his most productive years would have appeared increas- ingly uncertain and, perhaps, untenable
Watt might have taken some comfort from the writings of his friend William Henry, who defended a material theory that was also a chemical one of the general sort that Watt had developed and relied upon
In his Epitome of Chemistry Henrys prefatory panegyric on the importance of the relationship of theory and practice singled out Watt, who ‘by a clear insight into the doctrine of latent heat, resulting, in a great measure, from his own acuteness and patience of investigation, and seconded by an unusual share of mechanical skill, has perhaps brought the steam engine to its acmé of perfection
But Henry had been an early convert to the new chemistry and the material of heat that he employed was Lavoisiers ‘caloric
Despite Henrys claim, the clarity of Watts ‘clear insight into the doctrine of latent heat must have looked less certain to the man himself during this period
Other publications gave impetus to material, but non-chemical, theories of heat
Notable here was the posthumous publication of William Irvines Essays in 1805 by his son
Histories of chemistry routinely note Irvines ideas as one of the lines of theory developed by Blacks followers
Prior to the publication of Irvines Essays his interpretation of the concept of latent heat was known mainly through his lectures – Irvine succeeded Black at the University of Glasgow – and through the published reactions of others to that interpretation
Th anks to the eff orts of William Irvine the younger in compiling the Essays, however, Irvines mate- rial, but non-chemical, interpretation of latent heat gained greater salience in the early nineteenth century
Watt was implicated in the publication of Irvines (1)(2) Irvine Jr relied upon, and acknowledged in the text, Watts recollections of some of Irvines experiments at which Watt was present as a witness
He also gave Watt credit, alongside Cavendish, for discovery of the composition of water, and he cited Watts determination of the latent heat of steam
What Irvine Jr did not do, however, which Watt must have felt mounting pressure to do, was explain how Watts interpretation of latent heat diff ered from his fathers
Publication of the Essays, and reviews of them, prompted commentary at least on the diff erences between Irvine and (1)(2) Black had interpreted ‘latent heat as the cause of changes of state
At the point at which water changed into steam, for example, the extra heat that had to be supplied, and that was not ‘discoverable by the thermometer, was, according to Black, combined with the matter of water to produce steam
(Although Black did not, in fact, explore the broader chemical ramifi cations of this idea, Watt did
In that sense Watt was more heavily commit- ted to the chemical interpretation of latent heat than the professor was)
Irvines view was that the change of state involved a change in the substances ‘capac- ity for heat – steam having a greater capacity for heat than water, for example
So the latent heat was the heat that had to be supplied to ‘satisfy the steams increased capacity for heat
Th e latent heat was not, on this account, combined with matter
Critics of the Irvinist view argued that it off ered no explanation for the cause of the change of state, whilst its supporters contended that Blacks account gave no reasons why the solid should have greater affi  nity for the matter of heat
At this stage the details of these conceptual gyrations are unimportant
Th e key point is that the airing of these issues, looked at from Watts point of view, must have put him ‘on the spot
Given that Watts thinking from the 1760s to the 1790s had relied so heavily on a chemical interpretation of latent heat, and given the growing complexity (at best) and increasing tenuousness (at worst) of the place of that interpretation in chemical opinion, what was Watt to do
I suggest that he decided to simplify the situation by disengaging the story of the steam engine improvements from his original, but now increasingly problematic and apparently outmoded, chemical ideas
Th e ‘properties of steam was aft er all a highly ambiguous term
Nineteenth-century thermodynamicists oft en referred to the ‘thermal laws discovered by Black and by Watt as a way of putting to one side the contentiousness involved with theories of heat
My suggestion is that Watt himself, in the early 1800s, took a step in that same direction, eff ectively disconnecting his chemistry from his steam experiments
Th e early nineteenth century saw not only an increasingly unsettled theo- retical climate in studies of heat but also some direct challenges to the way that Watt had thought of the force of steam
Watts chemistry told him that it was the chemical combination of heat with steam that accounted for the elasticity of the latter, so that the more latent heat that steam contained the greater was its elasticity and therefore the greater the force that it would exert
But this idea began to be seriously questioned as other investigators conducted experiments on the elasticity of steam with greater precision and over a wider range of tem- peratures than Watt had covered in his experiments of the 1760s and 1780s
In France, Agustin de Bétancourt conducted extensive experiments, and in Britain John Dalton published on the topic in the Manchester Memoirs in 1802
Watt was certainly aware of this work
He had his assistant John Southern conduct further experiments on the elasticity of steam in 1796, and again in 1803
Th e latter experiments, and the collection together of previous ones as well as those of other researchers, may have been prompted by a request from Laplace for information on the history of Watts invention and on his steam experiments
Th is request followed Watts visit to Paris in October and early November 1802
Watt produced two replies to Laplace, which are in draft  form in the archive
Th e fi rst, dated January 1803, is a narrative of his inventions very much in the vein subsequently published in (1)(2) Th e second, dated 22 February 1803, deals more specifi cally with Watts experiments on the latent heat and elasticity of steam in response to a more specifi c request from (1)(2) In this Watt gave an account of his earlier experiments and those of Southern whilst also display- ing knowledge of the work of Bétancourt and (1)(2) Watt was being put on his mettle here
It is possible that he was being tested out prior to his nomination for the prestigious corresponding membership of the French Institute, to which he was elected in 1808
Be that as it may, Watt was certainly being pressured to produce the science of steam as he understood it
Another publication from Manchester on this question came from John Sharpe, a friend of John Dalton, a solicitor and member of the Manchester Lit- erary and Philosophical Society, who read a paper to that body in 1806 titled ‘An Account of Some Experiments to Ascertain whether the Force of Steam be in Proportion to the Generating Heat
Although the paper was not published until 1813, it is more than likely that Watt knew of it earlier than that through his Manchester connections
Sharpes paper presented experiments designed to ascertain the quantity of latent heat contained in steam at diff erent temperatures
Th e saving of fuel in engines operating with steam at high temperatures had led him to ask whether this might be due to the constitution of steam at such high temperatures
It was known that steam at 212°F exerted a force equal to the weight of the atmosphere but that at only 40°F higher the force was doubled and that at 55°F higher still the force of steam increased to four atmospheres
Sharpe drew his fi gures from a paper by John (1)(2)49 So Sharpe set out to answer the following question: ‘How does this comparatively small addition of temperature produce so remark- able an increase of force
Neither published papers nor advice from friends conversant with the subject could provide an answer
However, Sharpe says: I was told, that (1)(2) Watt had made experiments; but could not learn the nature of them, or the precise results
It was supposed, however, that, as steam over water increased in temperature, it continued to combine with a greater quantity of heat than what was indicated by the mere increase of temperature; – so that steam of dou- ble the force of the atmosphere probably contained twice as much heat, in the same bulk, as steam at the common boiling temperature
Knowing that steam rising from boiling water at 212°F contains about 940°F of latent heat, it could be predicted that steam of double the force ought to contain more than 1800°F of latent heat above that indicated as its temperature, assum- ing that the ‘stronger steam was the same density as that produced at boiling point
So the experiments were designed to see if this was the case
If it was, then the elasticity of steam was a function of the amount of latent heat that it contained and Watts chemical theory of heat was supported
But if there was no such relationship then the increased elasticity of steam would be better explained by an increase in its density, and Watts position was challenged
Cardwell sees Sharpes paper51 as an important, if inconclusive, examination of the source of the high fuel-economy of high-pressure engines, which it cer- tainly is
But he misses, I think, the extent to which the paper was intended as a test of the idea that combined latent heat was the source of the elasticity of steam, and so a test of the chemical material theory of heat
Th e fact that Sharpe refers to the article ‘Steam in the Encyclopaedia Britannica tells us that he would be familiar at least with Robisons version of Watts ideas on the question
Certainly, the reception of the paper on publication gives indications that this issue was the main focus of interest
For example, in its analysis of the Manchester Memoirs for 1813 (in which Sharpes paper was fi nally published) the Annals of Philosophy asked, ‘Now is the increased elasticity of steam owing to an increase in the latent heat of steam, or to an increase in its density
(1)(2) Sharpes experiments seem conclusive in favour of the last of these opinions
In light of this sort of claim, it seems likely that Watt, in reconstructing the history of his improvements, would have been inclined to play down the chemical theory of steam that he had worked with from the 1760s to the 1790s
Th is was in fact what he did
In late May 1814 Watt wrote to Dr David Brewster, who had taken over from John Playfair the task of producing an edition of the works of John (1)(2)
Watt had agreed with Brewster to edit and annotate Robisons essays on ‘Steam and the ‘Steam-Engine from the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and it was this edited and annotated version that he sent to Brewster with his covering letter, itself to be published
Watt was prone to playing down his interest in this work, telling correspondents that it was a painful process
Watt may well have found it a chore, but he was encouraged and helped by Watt Jr and by John Southern, who were part of a team of Watt personnel giving time to the task
From the point of view of their patriarchs reputation this was a very important venture and it was taken with commensurate seriousness
For various reasons the publication of the fi nal four-volume work of Robisons A System of Mechanical Philosophy was delayed until 1822, by which time of course Watt was dead
However, some sepa- rate copies of the edited and annotated versions of Robisons essays on ‘Steam and the Steam Engine, which were the fi rst items in volume 1 of the larger work, were printed and privately distributed in 1818
So what account did they give
Th e most important general observation to make is that Watts experiments were again in evidence because an important motive was to correct Robisons account, especially so far as Watts relations with Black were concerned
So Watts independent experimentation was duly canvassed
However, Watt remained cautious about stating fully the ways in which his work had gone beyond (1)(2)
Th e impression given is that he arrived at the same view of latent heat independ- ently of the professor
Watt does not discuss the fact that he took the chemical understanding of latent heat further than Black ever did
Th e treatment of the understanding of steam cleverly incorporates later experimental work and makes important concessions to the Manchester Schools claims whilst maintain- ing Watts dignity and credibility
In this way, Watts steam experiments were rendered reconcilable with Irvinist and Daltonian views in a way that they had never been in reality
And so, insofar as Irvinist and Daltonian views of heat ultimately proved more readily translatable into the language and conceptual world of the physics of heat and, eventually, thermodynamics,54 so too was Watts narrative
Let us examine the way in which this was done
In a long note describing his experiments on the variation of the latent heat of steam with temperature, Watt acknowledged that ‘(1)(2) Southern is inclined to conclude, from the experiments on the latent heat of steam at high temperature [presented in the Appendix] … that the latent heat is a constant quantity, instead of the sum of the latent and sensible heats being so
Th is seems tantamount to an abandonment of what is known as ‘Watts Law – that the sum of the latent and sensible heats is a constant
Watt had used this idea not only in his devel- opment of ‘expansive working of steam engines but also, as we will see, it was important to his ideas about the chemical transformation of water into air
So, to abandon Watts Law was to jettison a key part of Watts chemical material theory of heat
We will see shortly, however, that a place was retained for it in a clever fashion
A note with Southerns initials acknowledges Daltons claim that ‘the diff er- ence of the temperature of two vapours of the same elastic force, raised from two diff erent liquids, is a constant quantity
In his further account of experiments on the elasticity of steam, Watt once again acknowledged Daltons experiments (as reported in Manchester Memoirs) and also those of Mr De Bétancourt (in Pronys Nouvelle Architecture Hydraulique), and of a Mr (1)(2) Aft er recount- ing his own experiments of 1764–5 and 1774, Watt noted that he had asked Southern to repeat them, with the assistance of Mr Creighton and considered the results (presented in Southerns letter to Watt in the Appendix) as very reli- able
Th e Appendix referred to contains Southerns letter to Watt on the steam experiments that he and William Creighton conducted in 1803
From meas- urements of the elasticity and density of steam, Southern stated that ‘Th ese results appear to support the conclusion that the density of steam is nearly if not accurately, proportional to its elasticity
And subsequently he states: ‘Th e opin- ion which I entertain from these experiments as to the latent heat of steam is, that it is a constant quantity, and perhaps this opinion obtains support from the modern discoveries of defi nite proportions
Th is is another positive gesture towards Dalton, and to this extent Southern, with Watts agreement, is cutting ties with Watts chemical material theory of heat
Th ere is a caveat entered, how- ever
Southern elaborates on what he intends ‘constant quantity to apply to and makes a distinction between what he calls the latent heat of expansion and the latent heat ‘that may perhaps properly be called constitutional
It is the latent heat of expansion that Southern considers a ‘constant quantity
He holds out the possibility that the latent heat of expansion plus the constitutional latent heat plus the sensible heat of a body of steam may be constant
Th is would be a modi- fi ed form of ‘Watts Law, and would, Southern argued, perhaps also account for the discrepancies between Watts measurements of elasticities at low tempera- tures and his own measurements at higher ones
Tellingly, at this point, Watt added a note saying: ‘I have, for very many years, entertained a similar hypoth- esis; but I know of no experiment whereby the truth of it can be demonstrated conclusively
All this leads me to think that ‘team Watt were seeking to present Watts experiments, and those done under his auspices by others, in a way that made concessions to more recent investigations and newer theoretical orientations, especially those of Dalton and his allies
At the same time, however, they attempted to rescue a degree of credibility for Watts original investigations and ideas
We have access to some of the working documents of ‘team Watt62 and these are revealing
We can, with a little eff ort, distinguish Watts original rough draft , the comments and additions of Southern, and also of Watt Jr, and the construc- tion of the fi nal text sent to (1)(2) While I have yet to fully unravel this, there are signs suggesting the social dynamics within the team
It is evident that South- ern was a ‘modernizing force, suggesting some changes to Robisons text in the way it dealt with heat that Watt did not accept
Southern was the main architect of his own letter, but throughout its negotiated composition, he was deferential to Watt, telling his master at one point that his notes were ‘intended as memo- randums or hints to draw Mr Watts attention to the text, and not to guide him in the advice he may think proper to give to Doctor Brewster … On this point (1)(2) Watt will of course exercise his own judgement
Tellingly, perhaps, the draft of Southerns letter ended with the expression ‘I remain, with the greatest esteem and veneration
Before its publication Watt struck out ‘veneration and replaced it with ‘respect
Had he not done so then the independence of Southerns experi- ments and conclusions, and the credibility of his own endorsement of them on the question of latent heat in particular, might have been put in question
Another author who examined the elasticity of steam and of other vapours at about this time was Andrew (1)(2)63 In a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1818, Ure gathered together the experi- mental results of Watt (so far as they were then available), of Dalton and of Bétancourt, as well as his own experiments
Ure noted that Black was the fi rst to investigate accurately the conversion of liquids into elastic fl uids but that he ‘directed his attention principally to the establishment of the general laws, leav- ing his pupils to investigate their ‘individual applications
Chief among those pupils were Robison and Watt, the formers investigations being made available in the article ‘Steam in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, while we have still to regret our ignorance of those executed by the latter philosopher [Watt], with probably a more complete apparatus, and more extensive views
We are indebted to him, indeed, for some curious observations of the latent heat of steam, at diff erent temperatures, which make us lament more, the want of those on the elastic forces themselves
Ure goes on to describe his own experimental determinations of the elasticities of the vapours of various substances, and then, confi ning himself to the cases of steam and alcohol, he challenges Daltons theory of the thermometric scale, concluding that ‘the progressions of elasticity in vapours, taught by (1)(2) Dalton, are geometrical fi ctions, intended to quadrate with his notions concerning tem- perature; but not consonant with the laws or phenomena of nature
On the contrary, Ure concluded with the view that, When the elastic forces of vapours are doubled, or when they sustain a double pres- sure, their interstices are proportionally diminished
We may consider them now as in the condition of vapours possessed of greater specifi c gravities
Hence, the second portion of heat introduced to give double the elastic force need not be equal to the fi rst, in order to produce the double tension
Moreover, this was a view, Ure asserted, that ‘accords with the experiments of (1)(2) WATT… He found that “the latent heat of steam is less when it is produced under a greater pressure or in a more dense state; and greater when it is produced under a less pressure or in a less dense state”
Ure acknowledged that Berthol- let considered this fact ‘unaccountable, but it was, he contended, nevertheless fact
Whether this view of the relationship between elastic force, density and latent heat of vapours was consistent with ‘chemical phenomena in general he left  others to determine
But he urged that ‘Whatever be the fate of the inves- tigation of the general law now respectfully off ered, the statement of (1)(2) Watt may be implicitly received under the sanction of his acknowledged sagacity and candour
In affi  rming the value of Watts steam experiments Ure was using the authority of the great man as a bulwark for his own experimental fi ndings, and by treating chemical considerations as a separate issue he encouraged a view that such considerations were unconnected with Watts experiments
In his conclusion to the paper Ure suggested the potential value of using alcohol vapour ‘for impelling the piston of a steam engine, though he prefaced the suggestion with a fi nal tribute to Watt: To the theory of latent heat, which, like the hydrostatic paradox of Archimedes, might have remained for ages a barren, though beautiful proposition, the fertile gen- ius of that philosopher [Watt] gave all at once its noblest application … by his new steam engine
Aft er him, many minds of the fi rst order for science and ingenuity have off ered schemes of farther improvement; but all either frivolous or abortive; with such prophetic judgment had (1)(2) WATT anticipated the happiest form and struc- ture of which it was susceptible
Watt and Ure were in touch at about the time that this paper was published
Th eir conversation would certainly have been interesting
If Watt, as I have sug- gested, was faced with a problem of philosophical credibility in the light of the work of Dalton (and Sharpe, as discussed above), then in Ure he might seem to fi nd a solution
Yes, Ure defended Watts specifi c fi ndings, which would possibly have been pleasing to the great man, but more than that he affi  rmed a way for Watts steam experiments to be freed of the chemical theory of heat that had given birth to them
Th is is even clearer from some of Ures later writing, notably his article ‘Caloric in his Dictionary of (1)(2) In that article Ure drove a wedge between Watts steam experiments and his chemical theory of heat by doing three things in juxtaposition: distancing Watt from Black on the testimony of Watt himself; supporting Watts approach to experiments on the elasticity of steam against that of other investigators (as he had done in his
paper) and, fi nally but crucially, taking a positivist view of the results of those experiments, declaring ‘how little room there is to pronounce dogmatic deci- sions on the abstract nature of heat
If the essence of the cause be still involved in mystery, many of its properties and eff ects have been ascertained, and skilfully applied to the cultivation of science and the uses of life
It was in this sense that Ure described Watts steam engine as ‘the most splendid trophy erected to the science of caloric
For informed readers the ‘science of caloric meant the pur- suit of thermal laws without too much concern about the nature of heat
Th ey were thus encouraged to read that approach back into Watts own work
In this chapter so far, I have shown that there is a plausible case to be made that Watt himself wrestled with the question of how to represent his path to the separate condenser and his other improvements
He did this over many years in a variety of contexts, and those varied occasions called forth interestingly diff er- ent accounts
Early versions stressed the extent and novelty of his experiments with steam, but the ‘Plain Story produced by Watt at a particular juncture in the patent trials of the 1790s took quite a diff erent approach
His solution to the problem in the early 1800s involved him reasserting his independent experiments but now as part of a narrative that downplayed the importance of his material and chemical conception of heat and presented his steam experiments as discovering what many nineteenth-century students of heat were to call ‘thermal laws
Th ese moves had another important eff ect – they disguised the substantive connections between Watts steam engine improvements and another chemical claim to fame as discoverer of the compound nature of water
During the course of the nineteenth century that other chemical claim was to be contested and denied, kicking further dust over the traces of James Watt, (1)(2)
Th e ‘Water Controversy and the Demise of Watts Chemical Fame Th e de facto modernization of Watts chemical ideas that he executed in his later accounts of his steam engine improvements also occurred in the campaign that the Watt camp mounted from the 1820s for recognition of Watt as discoverer of the compound nature of water
Th at campaign, and in particular the recontextu- alization of Watts chemistry that it elicited from opponents of his claims, were eventually to prove fatal to Watts chemical reputation
Th e ‘archaic chemistry thus revealed could not, of course, in all its defi ciencies be granted any signifi - cant role in Watts real achievements
Th e interpretation of those achievements was therefore driven into the arms of ‘engineering and, in some cases, ‘thermo- dynamics, a move that the ‘Plain Story and Watts early nineteenth-century narratives of his inventions did nothing to discourage
In Discovering Water I argued that the emergence of a single individual as the discoverer of the compound nature of water was a cultural process of attribution that involved both an explicit public controversy and a longer, less obvious but equally important, drift  of opinion detectable in textbooks and encyclopaedia treatments of the issue
Before the explicit controversy, which reached its height in the 1840s and 1850s, the drift  of opinion had been towards Henry Cavend- ish, though Watt remained a credible candidate
Th e explicit controversy, which occurred mainly in the 1840s and which both camps claimed to have won, gave Watt a new lease of life in the drift  of opinion, but in the later decades of the cen- tury Cavendish emerged as the discoverer in the great majority of attributions
Th e two camps diff ered crucially in their choice of ground on which to con- duct the explicit controversy
Watt Jr, Francois Arago, Francis Jeff rey, Henry Brougham and (1) (1) Muirhead, the most active pro-Watt participants, adopted what I have called an ‘empirical set of criteria against which to judge the issue of discovery
Th ey focused almost exclusively on the issue as one of priority – they sought to frame the controversy in terms of who fi rst publicly advocated the con- cept of water as a compound
In stressing ‘the concept I mean to indicate that the Watt camp believed (or at least conducted their argument as if ) the chemi- cal ideas about water that Watt and Cavendish came up with were essentially the same
Th ey passed silently over the de facto modernization of Cavendishs ideas that had occurred in intervening decades, and they granted Watt a similar ‘courtesy of silently modernizing his ideas also
Aft er all, their argument con- cerned merely the timing of the public announcement of those ideas
Certainly in Broughams, Muirheads and Jeff reys cases this was a natural move for them to make given that their expertise lay in the law and not so much in chemistry
Th e Cavendish camp, which included most of the leadership of the British Asso- ciation and a number of leading chemists, pitched their case on very diff erent ground
According to them, evidence addressed to the issue of timing was otiose
Th e Cavendish camp ignored the de facto modernization of Cavendishs water chemistry, but mounted a severe critique of Watts chemical ideas about water as ‘archaic, and therefore unworthy of the status of chemical discovery no matter what might be established about the relative timing of their public release
It is worth pointing out at this juncture that while my concern in this book is to recontextualise Watts chemistry in order to show its importance to his steam engine improvements, neither side in the water controversy had any incentive to do this and every reason to avoid it
Th e Watt camp followed the man himself in extricating the story of the steam engine from Watts detailed original chemistry of latent heat
When it came to the water question they also glossed over the details of that original chemistry
Th e Cavendish camp were intent upon deny- ing Watts reputation as a chemist but were happy, even anxious, to acknowledge his engineering achievements and to have them dependent in a general sense upon ‘science
Th e archaic chemistry that they revealed in service of the fi rst objective would only undermine the second if its relevance to the steam engine story was granted or explored
Th e Victorian phase of the water controversy was provoked by the publica- tion in 1839 of François Aragos Historical Eloge of (1)(2) Th is had been long in the making and was in many respects a collective eff ort by Arago, Watt Jr and Henry (1)(2) Watt Jr in particular had an endless supply of energy, anecdote and evidence when it came to promoting or defending his fathers reputation
Arago made a number of claims that were to anger and upset power- ful constituencies in the British scientifi c community
He claimed priority for Watt over Henry Cavendish as discoverer of the compound nature of water
He also strongly implied that Cavendish, with the help of Charles Blagden, had pur- loined Watts ideas and presented them as his own
In addition, Arago, who was a radical in politics, depicted Watt as a martyr at the hands of the British scien- tifi c hierarchy, near the apex of which sat the eccentric, frugal, but thoroughly aristocratic (1)(2)
In the decades aft er the death of the long-serving President of the Royal Soci- ety, Sir Joseph Banks, in 1820, scientifi c reformers were in the ascendant, led by gentlemanly devotees of the sciences with strong links to the ancient uni- versities
Th rough their institution building (notably the British Association for the Advancement of Science, f(1)), and their writings about the state of sci- ence, its method, and its history, these gentlemen of science sought to defi ne the nature of science and to prescribe how it should be conducted, supported and applied to the purposes of life and industry
For many of these men, Henry Cavendish was a scientifi c hero, an icon of sophisticated, sustained, ingenious, fruitful, but thoroughly disinterested, research
Th ey were outraged by Aragos claims and accusations
Th e fi rst to respond publicly to Arago was the President of the British Asso- ciation, the Reverend William Vernon (1)(2)77 Th e son of the Archbishop of York, an Oxford graduate with a strong interest in chemistry, and one of the founders of the Association, Harcourt used his Presidential Address to fi ght back
Although Harcourt did claim experimental and theoretical priority for Cavendish, he rested his case substantially upon the superior quality of what Cavendish had done: Whilst the views of Cavendish are shown by the internal evidence of the experiments themselves, and the train of reasoning which they imply, to have been from the fi rst precise, and philosophical, those of Priestley and Watt were always, as regards the former, and till aft er the publication of Cavendishs and Lavoisiers papers, as regards the latter, vague and wavering to a degree scarcely comprehensible to those who have not studied the ideas prevalent at that period of chemical history
Harcourt found Watt guilty of loose reasoning because his ideas on the com- position of water were bound up with phlogiston theory, though he was more charitable towards Watt than other of his colleagues when he acknowledged that many of the best chemists of the day (that is of the 1780s) were similarly entangled
Crucially, however, that was not the case with Cavendish, according to (1)(2) While most around him sank in the quicksands of imponderable substances, Cavendish moved steadily ‘from truth to truth, on every point on which experiments aff orded ground for reasoning, unfettered by the complexity of the phlogistic theory
Less charitable about Watts qualities as a chemist was George Peacock, Dean of Ely,80 who found Watts 1784 paper in the Philosophical Transactions ‘singularly obscure whilst praising Cavendishs as a model of precision and intel- ligibility of the sort that was to be expected from someone of his powers who had been ‘trained in the best and most rigorous school of inductive philosophy
Cavendish was, aft er all, a Cambridge man, Watt a Scottish autodidact
Another supporter of Harcourts stance and, in fact, some thought, the secret architect of it, was the Reverend William Whewell, the Master of Trinity College, Cam- bridge
Whewell wrote privately to Harcourt in the midst of the furore that Harcourts ‘Address had created – he had, aft er all, attacked Watt in front of the assembled worthies of Birmingham as well as the worthies of science
Whewell reassured Harcourt by denying that help was needed even as he off ered it: I see that you are assailed on various sides for what you have said about Watt and Cav- endish … Your case, as you fi rst put it, remains to my mind quite unshaken
But perhaps you may be wishing to know how the subject presents itself to my mind, looking at it rather with reference to the general course of the history of Science than to any special evidence of dates and the like… Watts views are utterly damaged by involving a com- position of ponderable and imponderable elements
Th is of itself was enough to show that he did not consider elementary composition with the rigour and distinctness which the discovery of the synthesis and analysis of bodies at that time required… And thus Watt, who at most can only claim the merit of proposing a hypothesis, proposed one which by its very terms was unsuited to the step which science then had to take
Th e fi rmness of Whewells rejection of Watts credentials as a chemist is as clear from this as the rampant, purposeful presentism of his historical approach
Th e ‘rigour and distinctness that Whewell fi nds lacking in Watt was not a self- evident value in the 1780s, as he assumes it to be
Whewells views on Watt quickly made their way into public pronouncement via his Philosophy of the Inductive (1)(2) Th ere Whewell fi rst established his ‘Maxim respecting Imponderable Elements, specifi cally that heat and light, not being things, cannot and should not be considered in chemical composition and decomposition
If they are so introduced ‘vague and insecure reasonings will lead to error
Having essentially installed the principles of Lavoisiers new chemistry as timeless ground rules, it is no surprise that Whewell fi nds Watt wanting: Watt ‘does admit imponderable fl uids as chemical elements, and thus shows a great vagueness and confusion in his idea of chemical composition
Members of the developing chemical community took little direct part in the water controversy as such as it wound its way through the pages of the reviews
Th e chemists in the 1840s faced the need for a delicate balancing of the academic and practical interests in their ranks
Th is made full-blooded engagement with the Watt–Cavendish contest an unwise move for the leadership of the chemical community
For the most part they avoided it
Nevertheless, when the chemists founded a chemical publishing society it was called the ‘Cavendish Society and one of its fi rst publications was a life of Henry Cavendish by the Scottish chem- ist George (1)(2)
Wilsons Life of Cavendish is a remarkable book for the minuteness of the detail that it enters into about the water controversy
Overall the work is a vindication of Cavendishs claims and a denial of Watts
But in the course of its arguments the book sometimes conceded a good deal to Watts reputation as a chemist
Wilson oscillated between the kind of rampant presentism that Whewell favoured and a thoroughgoing ‘contextualism in which he sought to apply the standards and understandings of the 1780s to judgements about the chemistry that Cavendish and Watt were producing
In his contextualist moods Wilson granted substantial credit to Watt, acknowledging that Watts contem- poraries could with justice have regarded him as a discoverer of the compound nature of water
He conceded that Watt had helped in ‘inducing belief in the compound nature of water and that his chemical contribution had ‘a place in the history of science, whether it pleases us that it should have such a place or not
But granting Watts chemical reputation in his own time was not to deny, Wilson argued, the superior attainments of Cavendishs train of research and the superiority of his careful, judicious and accurate methods to Watts ‘following Priestley in all his devious wanderings
It was only thanks to Cavendishs prior experiments that Watt was able to prise himself away from Priestley momentarily and ‘approximate to the true theory of the composition of water
Another writer on these questions who was sympathetic to Watt in many respects was James David Forbes, a Scottish natural philosopher known for his work on glaciation and on the science of heat
Forbes was a member of the inner circle of the British Association leadership, but not so inclined as Whewell to dismiss entirely the claims of his fellow countryman (1)(2) Forbes undertook to write a ‘Preliminary Dissertation for the eighth edition of the Encyclopaedia Bri- tannica
Forbess theme was the interdependence of theory and practice, and Watt loomed large
We will see in the next chapter in more detail how Forbes depicted Watt as a special kind of ‘philosophic engineer
Th is was an impor- tant move in the construction of the ‘mechanical Watt
Our immediate concern, however, is how Forbes resolved the puzzle over what to do about Watts chemi- cal claims
In 1855, as he worked on the section dealing with Watt, Forbes sought and received advice from Wilson on this
Th e key question, as so oft en before in Watts own writings about his achievements, was the relationship between Watt and (1)(2) Wilson encouraged Forbes to reassert Watts debt to Black so far as the chemistry of latent heat was concerned
Th is would set right not only writers in the Watt camp who persisted in making claims for Watts independ- ence of Blacks work on that question but also ‘Watts own misconception of his debt to Black
Th is is, I think, a very signifi cant move, since it insulates Watts engineering achievements, which Forbes, Wilson and indeed the ‘Gentlemen of Science were anxious to praise to the skies, from his chemistry
Instead it made those achievements dependent upon what was by now the sanitized version of Blacks latent heat discovery
Th e philosophic engineer drew, as was appropriate, from the university-based natural philosopher
Providing that the engineering achievements were insulated in this way, there was no harm, and much justice involved, in acknowledging Watts chemical credentials in a general sense
Th us, while Wilson advised Forbes to leave the water controversy ‘untouched in Watts Life he might notice with additional fullness Watts knowledge of the chem- istry of his time
He was, aft er all, a friend of Black and Priestley, had helped to introduce chlorine bleaching, and was an experimenter himself
For these reasons Watt ‘had claims to be called a Chemist as the recognized coadjutor of the Chemists of his day
Forbes followed this advice
In this way Wilson and Forbes achieved a number of objectives in delimiting and characterizing Watts chemical reputation: they at once granted him chemical credentials in his own time whilst denying him credit for the discovery of the composition of water (thus depriving him of a major place in the making of the New Chemistry), and severed the connection between Watts archaic chemistry and his engineering achievements
Th is latter move was crucial to the viability of Forbess attempt to construct Watt as a ‘philosophic engineer
Th e supporters of Cavendishs claims in the water controversy were, in gen- eral, in a better position than the Watt camp to institutionalize their viewpoint
Th e explicit controversy was essentially over by the 1850s but thereaft er myri- ads of attributions of the discovery in encyclopaedias and in textbooks built a consensus behind (1)(2)89 Pockets of chemical recognition persisted for Watt,90 but even at their most scholarly these had become merely an interesting sidelight on Watts life and achievement rather than being seen at its heart
Th e water controversy, and Watts self-fashioning in the last twenty years of his life, eff ectively extinguished Watts reputation as a chemist and disguised the genuine links between his chemical understandings and his engineering achievements
Statues and other images of Watt, especially those drawing on the kettle story, eff ectively ‘naturalized the mechanical Watt and, together with accounts in popular encyclopaedias, conveyed that conception of him to a much wider audi- ence than was directly reached by Watts self-fashioning or by the literary slings and arrows of the water controversy
If the side of the coin bearing the ‘chemical Watt ended up face down in the nineteenth century it is obvious that the side bearing the mechanical Watt came to lie face up
I move now to examine how that face was constructed
– 59 – 3 THE ‘MECHANICAL WATT: THE MAKING OF  A ‘PHILOSOPHICAL ENGINEER Th e chemists of the nineteenth century did not embrace Watt as one of their number, but the case was very diff erent with its engineers
In fact not only did the engineers ‘pull Watt into their company but the chemists, and other elite scientists, as we saw, ‘pushed him in that direction
Watt was, according to the likes of James David Forbes, an indiff erent chemist but a ‘profound engineer
He was characterized as a ‘philosophical engineer because of his understanding, command and use of physical law
My argument in this chapter is that Watt was made into an ‘engineer in the nineteenth century – perhaps it would be better to say ‘engineers since he was constructed as multiple manifestations of the type during that period
Th e impli- cation of this process of construction is that Watt was not an engineer in the late eighteenth century, during his own lifetime
To divest Watt of the status of engineer may seem perverse and I do not mean this literally
His contemporaries oft en referred to Watt, and he designated himself, as an engineer
Indeed, ‘James Watt, Engineer was the extended identifi er that he used in his published papers in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of (1)(2) His collabora- tive publication on pneumatic medicine with Th omas Beddoes used the same phrase on the title page
But it is only apparently perverse to problematize this self-identifi cation because the term ‘engineer underwent a remarkable evolution from the mid-eighteenth century to the end of the nineteenth
In understand- ing Watts self-designation as ‘engineer we need to understand, I suggest, what that term meant in his own time
Having done that we can then comprehend something of the way that Watt habitually presented himself to the world, and how he sought to negotiate the ambiguous status that ‘engineer then brought with it
For Watt was no ordinary engineer, and he and his friends wanted to make that clear
He was a ‘philosophical engineer
Watts knowledge of natural law and his own experiments on steam were what made Watt ‘philosophical, but that knowledge was chemical knowledge to the late eighteenth century while it was glossed as knowledge of thermal laws by the early nineteenth
Th e Changing Engineer Th rough most of the eighteenth century the term ‘engineer was more of an occupational designation than a professional status
An engineer was in one important sense of the term an erector of engines
Watt was certainly in that business, though of course he would rightly claim to do much more
He invented and designed engines and oversaw their erection as well as making a successful business with Boulton out of their sale and operation
Th e only context in which the term ‘engineer rose above trade through most of the eighteenth century was a military one – ‘Royal Engineers were offi  cers, and they were gentlemen
Only gradually and haltingly in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century did the term ‘civil engineer come into regular use
It was intended to depict a pro- fessional man by analogy with the military engineer
Th e leading civil engineers claimed the gentlemanly status of their military brethren
It is against these changing patterns of usage that Watts self-designation as ‘engineer must be viewed
Interestingly, and importantly, he did not use this self- description consistently
Th e copper plate, dating from circa 1775, that was used to produce Watts ‘business card was inscribed simply ‘(1)(2) Watt, Soho, Birming- ham
In the world of business, where social status counted for a great deal, for Watt to present himself as ‘James Watt, Engineer would have been unhelpful and misleading
In the learned and scientifi c world too, the label ‘engineer was nei- ther widely used nor particularly advantageous to the bearer
An examination of the extent to which the term was used in nominating individuals for Fellowship of the Royal Society reveals that the only time it appeared before the 1820s was in the cases of ‘Royal Engineers
Th ese men were recommended for the Fellowship not as engineers as such, but as gentlemen interested in the sciences and their promotion
A Royal Engineer was almost as likely to be admitted to the Society for his botanical, or even his antiquarian, exploits as for anything directly relating to his engineering
Outside a military context the engineer was likely to be asso- ciated with trade
Under the Banksian regime in the Royal Society, and beyond, a candidate for the Fellowship who might be perceived as tainted by trade – and therefore likely to turn the FRS to illegitimate use by trading on it – had to prove in some other way a disinterested approach to natural knowledge
For the engi- neer this was oft en done by demonstrating the execution of  ‘public works, that is, a contribution to the common benefi t or that of the State beyond personal interest or profi t
Watts nomination certifi cate for the Royal Society does not contain the word ‘engineer
He is presented as an ‘inventor and an author: James Watt Esqr of Birmingham, inventor of the new Steam engine, and author of a valuable paper in the last volume of the Philosophical Transactions, being desirous of becoming a fellow of the Royal Society, we whose names are hereunto subscribed do, from our personal knowledge, recommend him, as likely to be an useful member…
Yet, as mentioned, Watt did use the designation ‘James Watt, Engineer in his papers read to, and published by, the Royal (1)(2) How can we explain this
To do so involves me in some social psychological speculation
It is known that during his most active years Watt was given to bouts of depres- sion (‘low spirits) and to violent headaches
He lacked confi dence in dealing with men, and found the rough and tumble of business life diffi  cult and distasteful
His partner Boulton, and other of Watts close associates, accordingly diagnosed their friend as of a delicate, ‘intellectual disposition
Yet in Watts dealings with the learned world there is a strong tone of defi ance and pride
He considered that his constant appeal to experiment made him superior to other supposedly more learned predecessors, such as Desaguliers, who were less attentive in that department, and also distinguished him from mere engineers
Th is is evident, for example, in a draft  letter that Watt intended to send to Gaspard de Prony in 1803, to give the French engineer a history of Watts steam engine improvements
Refer- ring to his study of the properties of steam, Watt stated: ‘No man of science in this country had considered the subject since Desaguliers, & his writings on that head tended more to mislead than to (1)(2) In short this very useful invention [the steam engine] was abandoned to ignorant artifi cers
I suggest that when Watt, unusually and deliberately, designated himself ‘Engineer in his publications in the Philosophical Transactions, or elsewhere, he exhibited this same mixture of deference and defi ance
He was saying, yes I am an engineer but not a mere engineer
I am superior to the ‘run of the mill engineer because I am an experimentalist and a philosopher
Th is was not an entirely personal act in the sense that Watt was creating space for the idea of the philosophical engineer
Yet it was, I think, deeply personal too, going to the heart of Watts sense of identity
Th ere are signs that Watt inscribed his books in similar fashion – for example, his copy of (1)(2) Gregorys Elements of Catoptrics and Dioptrics, an adaptation of David Gregorys University of Edinburgh Lec- tures published in 1715, is inscribed on the preliminary blank page ‘James Watt Engineer/Birmingham/1778
Why do we inscribe books as we do
Beyond the practical business of marking property we may seek to convey an impression to the person who learns that this is our book, perhaps with one eye looking to pos- terity
We may even affi  rm our identity, in a small but signifi cant way
Plausibly, then, in so annotating his books Watt was saying ‘I am no ordinary engineer because I own and understand this work
If I am right in this social psychological diagnosis of Watts decision to call himself ‘James Watt, Engineer in his publications – and it is a decision requiring some explanation9 – then it becomes clear that in doing so Watt was making a point about the possible meanings of ‘engineer rather than describing the con- tent of the publications to which he attached the sobriquet
Th e patent trials of the 1790s were a more public forum in which Watt con- tributed to reshaping usage of the term ‘engineer
As already noted, the question  of the adequacy of Watts patent specifi cation was a key issue in those trials and  that issue in its turn depended upon the notion of one ‘skilled in the art
If a spec- ifi cation provided enough information about the invention for someone skilled  in the art to be able to realize it then the specifi cation was adequate
Boulton &  Watts legal team argued that whether someone found the Watt specifi cation  adequate or not was in fact a test of their quality as an engineer, a test of whether  they were in fact truly ‘skilled in the art
Being so skilled involved, they argued,  having the necessary natural philosophical knowledge and insight
Th e Boulton  & Watt lawyers called eminent witnesses, mostly Fellows of the Royal Society,  to attest to this notion of what a truly skilled engineer was
Th eir opponents,  Hornblower and Maberley, by contrast, relied mainly on witnesses who were  actual engine builders
Th e struggle was essentially one about what characteris- tics produced a superior engineer and the most credible expert witness
Was it  extensive hands-on experience of the sort possessed by the engine builders, or  was it a combination of such experience with a philosophical understanding of  steam engines
Th e legal judgement favoured the latter, and in so doing publicly  affi  rmed that Watt was a superior type of ‘philosophical engineer
So, when Watt described himself as ‘engineer in these diff erent contexts he  was making a point that an engineer could be, and in his case was, a philoso- pher, rather than a mere mechanic
He was claiming that an engineer could be  a man of science and that the class of engineer possessing such qualities should  be distinguished from the ‘ignorant artifi cers, as Watt called the run-of-the-mill  engineers
‘James Watt, Engineer did not connote Watts occupancy of an estab- lished role but functioned as a claim that he was  pioneering a new one
Th e fact  that Watt used this designation in his publications but not on his trade card was,  I think, signifi cant
In a business context, to call himself an ‘engineer would have  both risked his being mistaken for a mere artifi cer and misrepresented his status  as a proprietor of the fi rm Boulton & Watt – ‘(1)(2) Watt, Soho, Birmingham
It  is in this sense then that I argue that Watt was not an engineer in the common  eighteenth-century usage of that term
Where it might be understood in that  common usage he avoided employing it
He was happy, even anxious, to attach  it to himself when the term could be juxtaposed with a learned performance, or  work, and so represent a claim to a newly emerging status for the engineer
Claiming Watt for ‘Engineering Science In the nineteenth century Watt was a potent symbol with which many sought to associate themselves and their causes
Adoptions of Watt were many, varied, and of varied importance
Some were repeated so oft en and sustained to such a degree that they helped to shape historical perceptions of the man and his work
A key aspect of the professionalization of engineering in the nineteenth cen- tury was to be the claiming of learned status in the way initiated by Watt and a few other late-eighteenth-century engineers
Th is was an aspect, though not yet a required feature of membership, of the engineers club founded by John Smeaton and others, in 1771
Th e body was called the ‘Society of Civil Engi- neers or, subsequently and informally, ‘Th e Smeatonians
Not all the members by any means were known as learned men – many of their reputations were based entirely on their major engineering works
But Smeaton himself, the fi g- urehead, had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1753, was famous for his Philosophical Transactions paper of 1759 on wind and water power, was a winner of the Societys most prestigious award, the Copley Medal, in that year, and at the same time known for his major engineering works such as the Eddys- tone (1)(2) Smeaton was a learned engineer
When, in the early 1770s, at a time of great uncertainty about how best to develop his engineering career, Watt pondered writing a treatise on steam experiments and the steam engine, William Small encouraged him by pointing out that ‘Smeaton was fi rst distinguished by writing
Th ough in the end he did not write the treatise, Watt certainly aspired to the status of a learned engineer in the Smeatonian mould
Watt did not live long enough to see the rapid growth of professional engi- neering associations in the nineteenth century
In fact the ‘house of Boulton & Watt as run by Watt Jr had strained relations with those associations
Privately, Watt Jr considered that Soho-trained engineers were far superior to those run- ning the professional associations
Nevertheless, as numerous presidential and anniversary addresses testify, Watt himself became an important symbol for those organizations even though the advancement of the engineering commu- nity and profession sometimes seemed to require opposition to the idea that invention was a heroic business
Watt also became an important reference point for those who promoted academic engineering or ‘engineering science in the nineteenth century
Two groups are particularly worth considering
First the ‘Gentlemen of Science – who founded the British Association and who, as we have seen, strenuously denied Watt the status of a chemical discoverer – and sec- ond the group of Northern philosophers including Rankine, Tait and William Th omson (Lord Kelvin) who played such a signifi cant role in the development of ‘engineering science in the second half of the nineteenth century
Th e ‘Gentlemen of Science, such as Whewell, Harcourt, Herschel and Pea- cock, made their names as mathematicians, or astronomers, or as exponents of mathematical experimental philosophy, or as gentleman geologists
Th us, in gen- eral, they did not themselves pursue the practical sciences
Th ere were important exceptions, of course
Babbages engineering exploits in early computing are well known, and George Airy, especially as Astronomer Royal from 1836 became involved in many facets of engineering in building Greenwich into a centre for the application, as well as the pursuit, of the astronomical and geographical sci- ences
Whatever their own specializations, the Gentlemen of Science were all anxious to establish what they took to be the most appropriate and productive relations between the abstract and applied sciences
In this capacity, a number of them produced treatises intended to ground engineering education on a solid foundation of mechanics
In 1841, William Whewell published his text on Th e Mechanics of Engineering: Intended for Use in Universities, and in Colleges of Engi- neers
Although Whewells purpose was partly to improve engineering education, he also sought to make engineering part of a liberal education, as he explained: If the common Problems of Engineering were to form part of our general teaching in Mechanics, this science also might become a permanent possession of liberally educated minds
Every roof, frame, bridge, oblique arch, machine, steam-engine, locomotive carriage, might be looked upon as a case to which every well-educated man ought to be able to apply defi nite and certain principles in order to judge of its structure and working
Whewells point was that the custodians of mechanics were in a position to teach both engineers and the liberally educated gentleman a thing or two, and that the latter might, and ought to, be in a position to judge what many engineers did
Cambridge engineering, in which Robert Willis was another central fi gure, was grounded in such assumptions
George Airy made a similar point about hierarchy when, as an Honorary Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and a member of its Premium Committee, he was involved in setting prize questions
One of Airys sugges- tions for a premium topic was on steam engines
He explained to his fellow committee members the background to the topic, observing that he had exam- ined hundreds of steam engines when they were at work and oft en found that the engineers tending them knew little about the ‘standing adjustments of the engines: ‘One of these is the state of the condensometer
Not one engine in ten has [this] in order, and not one engineer in ten has any notion of judging the state of the condensation from the temperature of the discharged water
Airy noted that it was well known that power was lost by condensing ‘too completely but there was no rule of a theoretical or practical kind for working out the proper degree of condensation
Even when that proper degree had been worked out there might be other drawbacks in implementing it
He reported that the only reason an engineer had ever given him for not condensing more precisely was that it would ‘make the engine jump
On the basis of this experience, Airy suggested a question: To ascertain, from theory or from direct experiment, the degree of condensation which is most favourable for the working of a steam engine, as regards the produc- tion of mechanical power: to ascertain also whether any inconvenience is actually produced in any other respect by this degree of condensation, and to show how such inconvenience may be removed: and to give simple rules for the temperature of the discharged water or other indication, adapted to the use of engineers, for securing the proper degree of condensation
Airys purpose in this was clearly to elicit a scientifi c approach to the question of the ideal ‘degree of condensation, but to do so in a way that recognized the prac- tical complications and dealt with them in a scientifi c fashion too, and in a way that recognized the usual capabilities and levels of understanding of engineers who tended engines in order that workable rules might be formulated that they could apply successfully
Th is question captures well, I think, Airys assumptions about, and aspirations for, the relationship between the scientifi c elite, the scien- tifi cally competent engineer and the practical working engineer
Th e fi rst could set the question and judge the quality of answers to it, the second could develop solutions to it, the third could, with suitably simplifi ed instructions, implement the fruits of the investigation without needing to understand it
Th e sort of hierarchy that Airy envisaged was institutionalized in the relations and operations of the sections of the British Association that dealt respectively with the more abstract and the more practical sciences
Morrell and Th ackray describe the situation thus: Th e assumption of the Associations apologists was that theory and practice were sharply distinct yet connected in certain signifi cant ways
It was true that the mechanical arts oft en marched independently of mechanical science
But the best route to true, enduring, and satisfactory practice depended on theory…Th eory that was encoded and manipulated via abstract symbols took precedence
Mechanical sci- ence, transmissible by symbolic language, and not the mechanical arts, transmitted by personal demonstration, was to be increasingly professed within the (1)(2)
Section G of the Association, titled ‘Mechanical Sciences, was established in 1836, and appears to have operated according to this hierarchy, being more regu- larly led by academic engineers or people with strong scientifi c backgrounds
It was vital that the Association take notice of engineering since the accomplish- ments of the engineers were so important and visible in early Victorian (1)(2)
Th at it noticed and placed engineering in a subordinate role to abstract science was a way to claim some measure of credit for the natural sciences for the tech- nological wonders of the age and to highlight the importance of supporting ongoing investigations of nature that would, undoubtedly, produce future tech- nological fruit
So, where was the fi gure of James Watt in all this
From the perspective of the Gentlemen of Science it was important to properly appreciate the nature of Watts achievements
Th e man was such a potent symbol that misunderstanding him could be very dangerous and destructive of ‘right arrangements
When the Association met in Glasgow in 1840, the year aft er Harcourt had opened hostili- ties in the ‘water controversy in Birmingham, the question of what to say about Watt in another city where his ghost walked the streets was a vexed one
Reject- ing Watts credentials as a chemist had its dangers, especially if it was interpreted as a lack of interest in, or lack of appreciation of, his technological achievements
Th e General Secretaries (Roderick Murchison and Edward Sabine) instead gave the address of the President at the Glasgow meeting and invoked the ‘genius of Watt in a measured way: Raised through the industry and genius of her sons, to a pinnacle of commercial gran- deur, well can this city estimate her obligations to science
… she feels how much her progress depends upon an acquaintance with the true structure of the rich deposits which form her subsoil; and great as they are, she clearly sees that her manufactures may at a moment take a new fl ight by mechanical discoveries
For she it is, you all know, who nurtured the man whose genius has changed the tide of human interests, by calling into active energy a power which (as wielded by him), in abridging time and space, has doubled the value of human life and has established for his memory a lasting claim on the gratitude of the civilized world
Th e names of Watt and Glasgow are united in imperishable records
At the dinner given by the Magistrates and Town Council for the Associa- tion one of the early toasts was to: ‘Th e Memory of James Watt, and the other eminent men of Great Britain who have contributed to the Advancement of Science
Both the immediate diffi  culties created by the water controversy and the larger ideological issues concerning the connection of science and practice were well addressed by connecting Watt, Glasgow and (1)(2) But just what was that connection
No one familiar with the Associations recent aff airs could imagine that the science involved was chemistry
Perhaps Watt had drawn on his knowledge of science in his engineering improvements
Perhaps his devel- opment of the improved steam engine had itself encouraged scientifi c inquiry
Th at Watt the engineer be associated with science was important
If he were not then the opportunity was lost to depict one of the technological marvels of the modern world as drawing succour from science
However, what the association between Watt and science consisted in was, I think, left  deliberately obscure at the Glasgow meeting
Th ankfully, on other occasions and in other contexts it was thoroughly explored
One of the central fi gures of the Association who devoted considerable atten- tion to Watt and his work was James David (1)(2) We can take Forbess eff orts, as reasonably representative of how the Associations leadership thought about the ‘Great Steamer and science
We saw in the last chapter how Forbes dealt with the question of Watts chemical reputation, granting him, on George Wilsons advice, the status of a chemist as amongst his contemporaries, but not that of a chemical discoverer
I noted also that Forbes severed the links between Watts chemistry and his engineering achievements
Here I investigate more thoroughly the structure of Forbess treatment of Watt as a ‘philosophic engineer
Before outlining Forbess detailed estimation of Watt it is important to discuss the larger framework within which it was made in Forbess ‘Preliminary Disser- tation to the eighth edition of the Encyclopaedia (1)(2)20 As he surveyed the progress of the mathematical and physical sciences between 1775 and
Forbes was struck by the ‘advantages which have accrued to them both directly, and, as it were, refl exively, by the astonishing progress of the Mechanical Arts
Forbes was inclined to assimilate the mechanical arts to the physical sciences by regarding the ‘masterpieces of civil engineering – the steam engine, the locomo- tive, and the tubular bridge were the examples that he gave – as ‘only experiments on the powers of nature on a gigantic scale
Th ese experiments involved inductive skills ‘as truly philosophic as any eff ort which the man of science exerts: Whilst then we claim for Watt a place amongst the eminent contributors to the progress of science in the eighteenth century, we must reserve a similar one for the Stephensons and the Brunels of the present: and whilst we are proud of the changes wrought by the increase of knowledge during the last twenty-fi ve years on the face of society, we must recollect that these very changes, and the inventions which have occasioned them, have stamped perhaps the most characteristic feature – its intense practicalness – on the science itself of the same period
In exploring in more detail the relations of physical science and the mechanical arts, Forbes noted the great importance of instruments, of the mechanical skill and knowledge of physical principles that were united in them
Th e invention of instruments oft en involved the ‘clear co-ordination of the parts of an invention towards the attainment of a given result, with a due regard to natural laws, and the properties of the substances used
Th e merit of such inventions and their contribution to the progress of knowledge stood, no matter what had motivated them
Forbes noted the steam engine as ‘a striking example of this: Originally devised with an exclusively commercial object – the extrication of the Cornish mines from subterranean water, it became in the hands of Watt, fi rst an instrument for experiments on the relation of heat to matter; next in its improved form a beautiful exemplifi cation of these laws, and an enduring monument of the sagacity and skill of its author, as well as the most important inorganic agent which exists in modifying the social conditions of the entire globe
Finally … it becomes the instrument of fresh discoveries
Th is very engine has a theory to be worked out, prob- ably unimagined even by its sagacious author – its operation as an agent for obtaining power from matter by the application of heat, is shown in all probability a single case of a more general law … and this more general theory of heat as a motive power leads, once more, to new practical deductions, to the conditions under which such machines may be most usefully constructed and employed
Th e elisions that Forbes makes here that deliberately or inadvertently assimi- late Watt to nineteenth-century physical science are remarkable and important
Th us the phrase ‘the relations of heat to matter is used to describe the subject of Watts experiments with the steam engine
For Watt heat is matter, but the phrase assumes its separate identity and easily gives the impression that there is no discontinuity involved between that fact and the beliefs of the author of the invention
It would be too big a stretch for Forbes to assume continuity with Watt when he writes about the work of Carnot, Clapeyron and Th omson, yet even here the rhetoric minimizes the gaps – consider the impact of the key phrase, ‘probably unimagined even by its sagacious author – and encourages the reader to entertain the possibility that Watt did in fact anticipate in some fash- ion the laws of energy and thermodynamics
Inventors of this sort, Forbes claimed, had similar experiences as discover- ers
Before he saw the ‘cylinder of his model exhausted, and the piston descend under the action of his separate condenser, Watt felt the same ‘throb of anxiety, and subsequently experienced the same sense of triumph, as ‘the discoverer of a planet or the author of a theory
Of course, not all inventions or inventors were like this
Mere contrivance involved no genius, nor did the actual achievement of command over nature in itself distinguish an inventor as a philosopher
What did was the ‘foresight, the patience, the conceptive faculty, the clear-sighted and confi dent anticipations of what will be the results of natural laws acting in given circumstances, those circumstances being in essential particulars new
Within this treatment of the relationship between the physical sciences and the mechanical arts, a treatment in which Watt has already been used many times as an example, we fi nd Forbess characterization of the man and his work
It serves as the fi rst topic of chapter 4, on ‘Th e mechanics of solid and fl uid bod- ies, civil engineering and acoustics
Forbes began by identifying Watt as the most distinguished ‘practical man of science of the last hundred years or more
Th is is not so much because of the importance of his great inventions but because he ‘taught men to raise the useful arts to a new dignity, – to marry them to genuine, unpretending, and inductive science, – to disparage ignorance and empiricism, and to render the labours of the workshop subservient to intellectual progress
Watt had, thoughtfully, demonstrated the value of just that hierarchy that the Gentlemen of Science sought to institute
Before Watt the fi eld of philosophical mechanics had been barren for many years if not centuries
Certainly there were numerous contrivances on paper but ‘the really diffi  cult theory of machinery in motion was little understood before Watts day
Watt was not the fi rst to use the properties of steam as a source of power, but ‘he was almost the fi rst to study them as a philosopher, and to apply, with exemplary patience and skill, principles sought in the laboratory, to make available the most convenient of all motive forces
Th e series of ingenious contrivances whereby he applied these principles, observing and deploying all the time the scientifi c relations between them, were ‘a model of scientifi c research as much as a triumph of the mechanical art
Forbes acknowledged that these combinations of theory and practice were not rare in the present day, but it was Watt who set the main happy example
Th ough Watt was by education and habit a mechanic, and also a shrewd speculator, he was unusual for someone of his profession in seeing the value of theory
Th is, rather than his other qualities, was the source of his success and the reason why con- temporary scientifi c men like Forbes regarded him as exemplifying the relations of theory and practice
In all this, Forbes does not delve at all deeply into just what the theory was that Watt brought into such productive relation to his engineering practice
Vague talk of the theory of heat, of physical principles and the like is all that his readers were off ered, and this vagueness allowed for awkward issues such as Watts commitment to a material theory of heat, let alone a chemical one, to be elided
Many of the grounds on which Watts chemistry had been judged by Whewell, Harcourt and Forbes himself as outside the bounds of sound philo- sophical practice were used to rule his engineering practice as within those bounds
Th e mechanical Watt was awarded the title ‘philosopher, which the chemical Watt had been denied
Before leaving Forbess treatment of Watt it is worth noticing an impor- tant exchange that he had with none other than the prominent politician and historian Th omas Babington Macaulay about the nature and the value of dif- ferent types of knowledge, specifi cally the diff erence between that which was ‘superfi cial and that which was ‘profound
At the opening of the Edinburgh Philosophical Institution on 4 November 1846 Macaulay spoke ‘In Praise of Superfi cial Knowledge
He was refl ecting on the value of the library of the Insti- tution to those who were not scholars but were looking for ‘useful instruction and ‘harmless amusement
While Macaulay conceded the possibility that the library might nurture another Burns or Watt or Arkwright, he insisted that it was most likely that a broad range of the ‘respectable class would gain more modest benefi ts in moral and intellectual improvement
Macaulay then focused upon those who ‘are haunted … with an unreasonable fear of what they call superfi cial knowledge
Such people feared that a smattering of all manner of subjects is a dangerous thing, that half knowledge was worse than ignorance
In response to this demand that only profound knowledge be valued Macaulay argued that he had never heard a satisfactory defi nition of profundity: Th e argument proceeds on the supposition that there is some line between profound and superfi cial knowledge similar to that which separates truth from falsehood
I know of no such line
When we talk of men of deep science, do we mean that they have got to the bottom or near the bottom of science
Do we mean that they know all that is capable of being known
Do we mean even that they know, in their own especial department, all that the smatterers of the next generation will know
Macaulays answer to these questions was a resounding ‘No
He argued the point that the smatterers of the present know more, and know it more securely, than even the leading men of knowledge of previous generations
Invoking the story of Gulliver, he contended that ‘Th e pigmies of one society would have passed for giants in another
So even knowledge that is superfi cial by the standards of the leading intellectuals or philosophers of the time is worth having
In its turn their supposedly profound knowledge will be superseded even by the superfi cial knowledge of a later era
Th ere was little response initially to Macaulays sally, which, though pre- sented in a lighthearted and entertaining manner, raised highly contentious issues about the value of specialized knowledge versus that of the generalist, and the wisdom or otherwise of the widespread popularization of intellectual culture
Th e only immediate printed response was in Th e Times of 9 Novem- ber where the leader-writer admired Macaulays rhetoric, but concluded that the most important thing about knowledge was its mode of acquisition
It sharp- ened and invigorated the mind only when ‘it is received with labour, directed to some practical purpose, tested with severe examination, and accompanied with some active cognate employment
Without these conditions it produced inca- pable men – ‘Such at least is the general complaint
A more sustained response to Macaulay came two years later in Forbess introductory lecture to his natural philosophy class
Forbes made much of the point that superfi cial knowledge is sudden knowl- edge, that it is empirical and acquired by memory or by a limited experience
It is ‘not deduced from extensive study and general principles
Th e fi rst discoverer of something always has to work harder than the improver and is to be admired more, Forbes contended
It was Watt who sprung to mind as an example: ‘the leaky model of the steam engine on which Watt fi rst exercised his skill, is a greater trophy of power than all the machinery in Soho
As we saw above, Forbes was later to argue in his ‘Preliminary Dissertation to the Encyclopaedia Britannica that it was sustained application of physical principles to the solution of a practi- cal problem that constituted Watts genius
Th e result was profound knowledge
Th e bearer of superfi cial knowledge might amuse us and gain our admiration in much the way that a juggler or conjurer does, ‘but we should not employ him to build our ships, or to direct our railways
We engage an engineer of education and ability who is perhaps wholly devoid of manual dexterity himself
Th ough Watt combined qualities of head and hand in unusual measure, it was the head that made the diff erence
Forbes urged his students not just to acquire facts but to seek a deeper understanding of principles in order to avoid superfi ciality in their knowledge
Forbess riposte received some attention, including an anonymous review in Frasers Magazine that was in fact by his friend (1)(2)29 Th e Master of Trinity did not produce his best performance here but he did emphasize that Macaulays argument about the relativity of what could be judged superfi cial was delusive because it involved treating knowledge as a commodity, as bricks in a wall
On the contrary, Whewell argued, knowledge grows not by additions but by trans- formations
Profound knowledge – a term that Whewell did not entirely like – involved ‘distinct and clear thoughts, not merely remembered words; knowl- edge connected with principles, not merely noted as facts
Th ese were the criteria by which Whewell, like Forbes, judged Watts chemistry as superfi cial but his engineering profound, though it is ironic that, in arguing against Macaulay, Whewell granted an integrity to past knowledge systems that should have made him more sympathetic to the chemistry of imponderables
Whewell and Forbes were in fact not entirely in accord on the question of superfi cial versus profound knowledge, as their private correspondence reveals
Whewell tried to dissuade Forbes from publishing his Introductory Lecture, perhaps thinking it unwise to tangle with (1)(2)31 Whewell thought that they disagreed on comparing the knowledge of earlier and later times but Forbes insisted that ‘my thesis is exactly that which you so well state that “the knowledge of later times is more advanced, more extended: but not more profound, neces- sarily, except in more profound minds”
Let us turn now to the group of Northern philosophers who promoted their own brand of ‘engineering science from the middle decades of the nineteenth century
Th e group have been thoroughly characterized by Smith and Wise as acti- vated in their development of energy physics by theologically based ideas about waste and economy
Th ere were important diff erences between the Northern philosophers and the Cambridge group of Gentlemen of (1)(2) While the latter bequeathed strong suspicions about mixing commercial and scientifi c objectives that were taken up by the later nineteenth-century advocates of ‘pure science such as Huxley and Tyndall, the Northern philosophers had no such reservations
Wil- liam Th omson (Lord Kelvin from 1892) personifi ed the amalgamation of roles as natural philosopher, engineer and businessman
It is revealing that Forbes decided to decline an invitation from Th omson to attend a public dinner in Glasgow in connection with the Atlantic Telegraph, explaining to Whewell: ‘Th at, as you know is not in my line
And while cordially rejoicing in our excellent friends dis- tinction, I cannot help severely regretting that he has mixed himself up so much with the commercial branch of the aff air – which besides is far from prosperous
He is not only a Director but a Patentee in connection with it
Macquorn Rank- ine was another of the group who sat astride the worlds of science, engineering and business
Having won prizes in Forbess natural philosophy classes at the Uni- versity of Edinburgh in the mid-1830s, Rankine went on not to the Cambridge mathematics tripos but to an engineering apprenticeship with John Benjamin Mac(1)(2) Th ereaft er he combined a varied engineering career with high-level science publication
He read Clapeyron in 1842 and then began his writings on elasticity and the mechanical action of heat, culminating in the early 1850s with his thermodynamic formulations
Th ese were notable for linking the new science to the thermodynamics of engines in a way that gave, simultaneously, theoretical insight and practical methods of determining engine effi  ciency
It was Rankine too, who developed the ‘diagram of energy, which used the theory of the indica- tor diagram to unite the scientifi c study of energy and the practical operation of heat engines
Th is was the brand of ‘engineering science that Rankine promoted when he succeeded Lewis Gordon as professor of civil engineering and mechanics at Glasgow University in 1855
In that position he advanced the cause of ‘engi- neering science through his classes, his texts, his work for the British Association, the Institution of Engineers in Scotland, and the Glasgow Philosophical (1)(2)
He did much work on naval architecture and hydrodynamics, which placed him at the centre of a thriving academic engineering and shipbuilding community in Glasgow, a community much given to the use of Watt as a cultural symbol in the late nineteenth century
Th e ideology of the relations of theory and practice espoused by the North- ern philosophers was interestingly diff erent from that of the Gentlemen of (1)(2) Whereas the latter tended to treat theory and practice as distinct but related realms, the former emphasized their unity
Consider, for example, Rank- ines introductory lecture on the ‘harmony of theory and practice in mechanics, which was published in 1856 on his accession to the Glasgow chair
In that lecture Rankine traced ideas about the relations of theory and practice since the time when the Ancients put them in opposition, committing the great fallacy of a ‘double system of natural laws, the one type being theoretical, celestial, rational, and the other practical, terrestrial, empirical
From the time of Archimedes, he argued, the idea long persisted that mechanical skill and practical knowledge were of an inferior order, and that scientifi c men were ‘unfi t for the business of life
Rankine conceded that it was hard to fi nd in his own day anyone who would rationally defend the ‘discrepancy of theory and practice but he argued that people continued to act as if that discrepancy was real
As an example, he off ered a quotation from Macaulay,37 (as seemed to be de rigueur in introductory lectures at Scottish universities at the time
) which contrasted the deployment of geometrical skill with practical accomplishment in just that way
Rankines response is worth quoting at length: In fact the mathematical theory of a machine, – that is, the body of principles which enables the engineer to compute the arrangement and dimensions of the parts of a machine intended to perform given operations, – is divided by mathematicians, for the sake of convenience of investigation, into two parts
Th e part fi rst treated of, as being the more simple, relates to the motions and mutual actions of the solid pieces of a machine, and the forces exerted by and upon them, each continuous solid piece being treated as a whole, and of sensibly invariable fi gure
Th e second and more intri- cate part relates to the actions of the forces tending to break or to alter the fi gure of each such solid piece, and the dimensions and form to be given to it in order to enable it to resist those forces: this part of the theory depends, as much as the fi rst part on the general laws of mechanics; and it is, as truly as the fi rst part, a subject for the reasonings of the mathematician, and equally requisite for the completeness of the mathematical treatise which the engineer is supposed to consult
It is true, that should the engineer implicitly trust to a pretended mathematician, or an incomplete treatise, his apparatus would come down in ruin, as the historian has stated: it is true also that the same result would follow, if the engineer were one who had not qualifi ed himself, by experience and observation, to distinguish between good and bad materials and workmanship; but the passage I have quoted conveys an idea diff erent from these; for it proceeds on the erroneous supposition, that the fi rst part of the theory of a machine is the whole theory, and is at variance with something else which is independent of mathematics, and which constitutes, or is the foundation of, practical mechanics
Th is fallacy Rankine regarded as being at the bottom of a number of evils in modern society especially the lack of mutual communication between men of science and men of practice
He lamented both the tendency of men of science to favour and relish the abstruse and of practical men to over-value the practi- cal skill acquired by observation and experience in business by rejecting what science could contribute
But on a hopeful note he considered that this lack of communication was in decline
Evidence for this, Rankine thought, lay in the founding of university chairs in engineering science and also in the mutual com- munication between the Mechanical Sciences and Physical Sciences sections of the British Association for the Advancement of (1)(2) Th e Northern philoso- phers became a powerful force in the Association from the 1850s
In the passage in his History of England that Rankine objected to, Macaulay had been making a point about the ‘science of Politics: What the engineer is to the mathematician, the active statesman is to the contempla- tive statesman
It is indeed most important that legislators and administrators should be versed in the philosophy of government, as it is most important that the architect, who has to fi x an obelisk on its pedestal, or to hang a tubular bridge over an estuary, should be versed in the philosophy of equilibrium and motion
But, as he who has actually to build must bear in mind many things never noticed by DAlembert and Euler, so must he who has actually to govern be perpetually guided by considera- tions to which no allusion can be found in the writings of Adam Smith or Jeremy (1)(2)
Rankine rejected the view of engineering that Macaulay used in this analogy
For Rankine, the ‘engineering science that he pursued came from, and con- sidered, all that was practical and so could return its theory to the practical without fear of omission or of the need for an addition of what we would call ‘tacit knowledge
Th e theory and practice of the steam indicator was an excellent example of Rankines point, and his treatment of it is an exercise in trying to render the tacit dimensions of indicator use explicit and to analyse them scientifi cally
It is signif- icant that Rankine did not employ, or countenance, the notion of the indicator as stethoscope, a notion that was very popular with other writers on indicators in the second half of the nineteenth century
Th e analogy with the stethoscope conceded too much to an art of engineering reliant on the tacit knowledge of experience
I would agree that Harry Collinss treatment of such matters suggests that Rankine was doomed to fail, but for the present point it is the fact that he tried to eliminate the tacit that is important
Engineering science was not dis- tinct from, or above, practical engineering, it simply was practical engineering of a new and superior kind
Where does Watt come into this
Well, his example provides the capstone for Rankines case: For a century there has stood, in a room in this College, a small, rude, and plain model, of appearance so uncouth, that when an artist lately introduced its likeness into a historical painting, those who saw the likeness, and knew nothing of the origi- nal, wondered what the artist meant by painting an object so unattractive
But the artist was right; for ninety-one years ago a man took that model, applied to it his knowledge of natural laws, and made it into the fi rst of those steam-engines that now cover the land and the sea; and ever since, in Reasons eye, that small and uncouth mass of wood and metal shines with imperishable beauty, as the earliest embodiment of the genius of James (1)(2)
Th us it is that the commonest objects are by science rendered precious; and in like manner the engineer or the mechanic, who plans and works with understanding of the natural laws that regulate the results of his operations, rises to the dignity of a (1)(2)
Th us Rankine, like Forbes, presented Watts experiments with the model steam engine given to him by Professor Anderson to repair, as a model of the relations of theory and practice
For Rankine, Watt became the model ‘engineering scien- tist
Th is was Rankines version of what profundity in engineering consisted in
In the slightly fuller treatment of the history of Watts improvements which he gave in his Manual of the Steam Engine, Rankine again gave prominence to the model Newcomen engine and described Watts procedure as follows: Watt set to work scientifi cally from the fi rst
He studied the laws of the pressure of elastic fl uids, and of the evaporating action of heat, so far as they were known in his time; he ascertained as accurately as he could, with the means of experimenting at his disposal, the expenditure of fuel in evaporating a given quantity of water, and the relations between the temperature, pressure and volume of the steam
Th en reasoning from the data which he had thus obtained, he framed a body of principles expressing the conditions of the effi  cient and economic working of the steam engine, which are embodied in … the specifi cation of his patent of 1769…
So Rankine has Watt moving smoothly from the puzzle of the model New- comen engine to experiments, to data, to principles, and thence to specifi cation of the improved engine
Once again history is cast in the mould of the ideals of engineering science practice
Rankines successors continued the tradition of deifying (1)(2) Alexander Barr, who was to be the University of Glasgows offi  cial representative at the open- ing of the Watt Memorial Engineering and Navigation School, was one of these
In 1889 Barr had been appointed to the professorship of civil engineering and mechanics, which Rankine had formerly held
As in Rankines case, so in Barrs, Watt loomed large in his inaugural address, which off ered a retrospective on the mechanical arts
In such a retrospective and account of the aid which science had given those arts, Barr said, ‘we cannot fail to be led back to the genius of James Watt as the fountain-head in which the stream of progress had its source
With Watt, Engineering, as we know it, may be said to have begun
Barr found in Watts forebears qualities which had led to the blending of theory and practice ‘in the very fl esh and blood of the boy (1)(2) Watts acquisition of knowledge of nat- ural philosophy – through his own study and in learning from his contacts at the University – was crucial to his approach
Invention, as in Newcomens case could be the result of accidental observation, but in Watts case ‘the man of science, made his great invention by reasoning founded upon the knowledge of the laws of nature, which he had acquired through a long course of study and experiment
Th ere was no accident here, his method was bound to lead him to the desired result
Th e university had played its part in this, and, more recently, in support- ing the work of Sir William Th omson, whose researches were carried out ‘in the very rooms in which Watt worked and studied
Barr considered that the founding of schools of engineering science around the country was testimony to the value that engineers now placed ‘upon such a course of study as that which enabled Watt to strike out into new and untrodden paths in invention and discovery
Watt could serve other objectives besides those of the promotion of engineer- ing science
John Scott Russell, the engineer, naval architect and collaborator with Isambard Kingdom Brunel on the Great Eastern steamship, gave one of the early Watt Anniversary lectures to the Greenock Philosophical Society in 1867
Russell, who had then-current controversy about the patent system on his mind, took a rather diff erent and unusual angle in depicting Watt as a ‘philo- sophical engineer
He relied on a distinction between discovery and invention – the latter involving merely a ‘cunning piece of ingenious mechanism (what Forbes had called ‘contrivance) for which a patent might be given, the former a ‘hidden truth which, being a principle, ‘all men may, and do, and must use it
Of Watts status Russell was certain: James Watt was a discoverer
He discovered the great principle of condensation – instantaneous isolated condensation
He discovered that vacuum was a commod- ity that could be housed, garnered, stored, husbanded, set apart, kept at hand ready for instantaneous use … [Th is discovery] was enough to have made him celebrated as a philosopher, even if he had been ignorant as an inventor, and incapable as a mechanic
Russell justifi ed this ‘singular view of Watts achievement by using once again the familiar stories of the repair of the model engine at the University of Glasgow, the ensuing experiments with steam, the conceptualization of keeping the cyl- inder always hot whilst still (and contrarily) producing a good vacuum, and the moment of inspiration on Glasgow Green when Watt supposedly had the idea of the separate condenser that would achieve this
Russell thus relied primarily on Watts ‘Plain Story
Nevertheless, pinning down just what Watts discovery con- sisted in involved Russell in some diffi  culties
At one point he identifi ed it as the ‘great discovery of the annihilation of steam in a separate vessel, so as to make it a never-failing, never-ending reservoir of vacuum
At another Russell noted that ‘What he [Watt] claims to have discovered is the true nature of steam, by which Russell meant ‘properties of steam that dictate the most eff ective arrangement of the parts of the engine
If the discovery is of the properties of steam then it would seem that the spatial arrangement of the parts of the engine is an inven- tion
However, Russell insisted on calling this spatial arrangement – the ‘isolated condensation – a discovery also, because he wanted to place it beyond the reach of patents
He was writing at a time of considerable controversy over the patent system, and his remarks on patents should be seen in that context
Russell dis- tanced Watts achievement from the patent system: his great diffi  culty in obtaining a patent, and in maintaining it against evasion, con- sisted in this, that he had discovered a principle, that no principle can be patented, and that any patent for any machine he might invent could be so easily evaded that his right to one really turned on the delicate legal quibble whether it was possible apparently to take out a patent for a contrivance, whereas in reality it was a discovery he had made and not merely a machine
So here the symbolism of Watt the ‘philosopher engineer, the discoverer above the inventor and mechanic, was used by Russell to try to undermine the patent system and argue for its abolition
Such arguments were to be common among patent abolitionists of the period
Russells treatment of Watt illustrates the fl exibility of Watts career and persona as an ideological resource
Th ough he could be mobilized in this way by patent abolitionists like Russell, he was more oft en recruited to the pro-patent cause
Th ose who sought to reform the pat- ent system by strengthening the position of the patentee used Watts precarious patent career as an object lesson in the need for increased protection if crucial inventions were not to be lost entirely
My own argument would place discovery truly with the nature of steam
For Watt the properties of steam follow from its nature as a chemical compound of heat and water
Th at idea, though, can fi nd no place in Russells account of Watts discovery
His Watt, and that of many others among the elite of nine- teenth-century engineers, is not a chemist, but an experimentalist who studied thermal laws, an exponent of ‘engineering science
I will examine in Chapter
how a number of engineers and thermodynamicists depicted Watts ideas about heat
For the moment let me discuss some more examples of the placing of Watt so far as the relations of theory and practice are concerned
An example from the later nineteenth century is provided by the case of Sir Frederick Bramwell, who wrote the entry on Watt for the Dictionary of National (1)(2)
Bramwell was an engineer of a diff erent stamp from the academically based but commercially active Northern philosopher-engineers
Th e son of a London banker, Bramwell was apprenticed to the mechanical engineer John Hague, work- ing primarily on rail projects but also on experimental atmospheric railways and on an abortive scheme for steam-propelled road vehicles
He then managed an engineering factory before setting up his own business as a consulting engineer in the early 1850s
He became renowned as an expert witness in legal, especially patent, cases, his success being due to a knack for straightforward explanation of complex technical details and a good line in engaging exposition
Parliamentary Committees were another of his regular haunts and he represented numerous companies engaged in civil engineering projects
Bramwell was also very active in engineering and scientifi c institutions, including the Institutions of Mechani- cal Engineers, Civil Engineers and Naval Architects, the Society of Arts and the British Association, where he was twice chairman of Section G and, in 1888, one of the few engineers to preside over the entire (1)(2)52 When Bramwell was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1873 he would have been already acutely aware of the tensions in that organization between the advocates of ‘pure science and the exponents of ‘engineering science
His comments on the relations of science and practice in public addresses refl ected his professional trajectory, which placed him as an outsider to both camps
He was inclined to see the inventor as sui generis, telling the Society of Arts in 1874, for example, that inventions, as distinct from scientifi c principles behind them, were most oft en the product of the ‘ingenious man, who, in the course of his regular work conceived an improvement
Bramwell contended that ‘Between the discovery and its application there is a gap over which none but the workman can throw a bridge
Bramwells Presidential Address to the BAAS at its Bath meeting in 1888 was an eccentric, rambling performance but nevertheless had a serious message to convey about the relations of science and engineering
In what was fairly clearly a jibe at (1) (1) Huxley and his associates, Bramwell set out expressly to counter the sentiment of the ‘Pure Scientist: I trust … I shall prove to you that applications of Science, and discoveries in pure Science, act and re-act the one upon the other
I hope in this to carry the bulk of my audience with me, although there are some, I know, whose feelings, from a false notion of respect for Science, would probably fi nd vent in the ‘toast which one has heard in another place – this ‘toast being attributed to the Pure Scientist – ‘Heres to the latest scientifi c discovery: may it never do any good to anybody
Bramwell explained that he, an engineer, came to address the Association as President by virtue of a system that informally and approximately rotated the offi  ce between its (1)(2) It had been decided that it was the turn of Section G, Mechanical (1)(2) Bramwell noted that the last time a ‘purely Engineering member occupied the chair was in Bristol in 1875 when Sir John Hawkshaw was (1)(2) He was disinclined to count Sir William Siemenss Presidency of the Association as an instance since that great engineers scientifi c attainments saw him representing the Physical Section A, rather than Section (1) Th is was symp- tomatic, Bramwell argued, of a larger problem: when Engineers, such as Siemens, Rankine, Sir William Th omson, Fairbairn or Arm- strong, make a scientifi c discovery, Section A says it is made, not in the capacity of an Engineer, and, therefore, does not appertain to Section G, but in the capacity of a Physicist, and therefore appertains to Section A – an illustration of the danger of a man fi lling two positions of which the composite Prince-Bishop is the well-known type
A greater willingness to contemplate the engineer as part of the scientifi c enter- prise required, Bramwell argued, a better appreciation of how the advancement of science and its application were related
Section G, he contended, contributed more than any other to the application of science and, for that reason, ‘is doing a very large share of the work of advancing Science, and is fully entitled to be periodically represented in the Presidency of the whole Association
Bramwell used substantive developments to support his case
No one, he suggested, could argue that the commercial application of electricity to com- munication and to the purposes of lighting had not given an ‘enormous impulse to ‘pure electrical science
Th e possibilities and probabilities of applications had stimulated acute minds to investigations in electrical science
He also discussed the development of prime-movers, which were due to the application of science and the work of the civil engineer
(Bramwell noted that he used that term, as it should be used, to apply to all engineering other than military
) In fact, he recalled, the Charter of the Institution of Civil Engineers defi nes civil engineer- ing as ‘the art of directing the great sources of power in Nature for the use and convenience of man
Nothing could be more benefi cent or honourable despite the tendency of many to treat such work as mechanical and unintellectual
Bramwell struck back against the purists
Some would make the engineer subor- dinate to even the mere bookworm, but Bramwell reminded them of the words of Sir Th omas Browne in condemning those who made their ‘head a grave
Far from this, the engineer must not only have, but must exercise science, and he must be trained in it to appreciate what might be done with scientifi c discover- ies
In this way ‘the application of science by the engineer not only stimulates those who pursue science, but adds him to their number
Bramwell even argued for the poetry in engineering, what today we might call the ‘technological sub- lime,57 and concluded: the work of the Civil Engineer is not of the earth earthy, is not mechanical to the exclusion of science, in not unintellectual; but is of a most benefi cent nature, is con- sistent with true poetical feeling, and is worthy of the highest order of intellect
All this might make us curious as to how Bramwell chose to portray James Watt in the Dictionary of National Biography article that he was asked to write
Bramwell, in fact, made Watt something of a composite of otherwise competing depictions
First, at the head of the article, he designated Watt unequivocally, and uniquely, as ‘engineer in a manner reminiscent of his own assumed status in the Association as a ‘purely engineering member
Bramwell also made a good deal of Watts ‘manual dexterity as exhibited in making models in his fathers business
He also noted that Watt ‘prepared himself, as a man of science, to deal with the problem of improvements of the steam engine in actual practice
Th is suggests that Watt conformed to Bramwells stated ideal for the engineer to be a generalist rather than a specialist so far as science was concerned
Indeed, in sum- marizing Watts character as an engineer he off ered the view that he was ‘not a mere specialist dedicated to one subject, but was of great general scientifi c learn- ing, and was a happy instance of a man who based his inventions on scientifi c data, and proved them in the model form by aid of his rare manual dexterity
Understandably, given his own origins, training and mature professional per- sona, Bramwell opted for a composite Watt, an engineer who drew upon science but also an ingenious man who had the qualities of the craft sman
At the very apex of engineering science in the later nineteenth century stood Sir William Th omson, the most prominent of the Northern philosopher engi- neers, who became Baron Kelvin of Largs in the New Years Honours List in 1892
Congratulations fl ooded in from all and sundry
Fellows of the Royal Society, among them (1) (1) Huxley, slapped their colleague on the back and revelled in what they described as the honour done to science
(1) (1) Preece, elec- trician to the Post Offi  ce and about to become its engineer-in-chief, addressed his letter of ‘sincere pleasure at Th omsons ‘translation to the upper sphere to ‘Baron Megohm & Lord of the Lightning
He considered that translation to be an ‘honor which the whole of our profession [engineering] will regard with gratitude for it crystallizes imperically [sic] what we all feel mentally that you are not only our respected chief but our much loved leader
Members of the naval service welcomed this reward ‘for your splendid compass to steer us clear of danger, and your invaluable sounding machine to guard us
Others considered Th omson deserving for his ‘extraordinary inventive genius and profound scien- tifi c research
A correspondent who had studied with Th omsons father observed that Arago had spoken in his life of Watt with ‘indignant surprise that Watt had not been made a Peer, a reproach that had been taken away with Th omsons own elevation
Th e new Baron Kelvin of Largs shared the protean reputation of the ‘Great Steamer
Kelvin, it might be thought, had little need for symbolism at any public event; he had merely to show up and be himself
But to have Kelvin and Watt on the menu together was a heady combination, which proved tempting a number of times as the century turned
Th e Scotsman reported that on 22 January
the fi ft ieth Watt Anniversary dinner had been held in Glasgow at the Windsor Hotel in St Vincent Street with a distinguished company of seventy gentle- men drawn variously from the British and Japanese navies, the engineering and shipbuilding worlds of Glasgow, and headed by the Provost and Lord Kelvin himself
Kelvin was called upon to propose the toast of the evening, ‘To the Memory of James Watt
Here is part of the newspapers report: Th ere was in the possession of the Glasgow University still, he [Kelvin] said, the model which Watt was employed by it to repair, and in repairing which the great man saw not only what was to be mended, but some of the defects of the principles which it realized, and was led from that small beginning to the great work which they were that evening commemorating – (applause) – a work which had made the century, not in the eyes of engineers merely, but in the eyes of the whole world, the century of James Watt (Applause) …Of all the sixty centuries of recorded human history no cen- tury had been so great as the 19th century in engineering, in the work of the engineer to apply the laws of matter and the principles of science for the benefi t of mankind
(Applause) … In pure science Watt was a leader
He (Lord Kelvin) well remembered how the words ‘La loi de Watt were always on the lips of his (Lord Kelvins) great master in physical science, (1)(2) Th ey referred to a decision of Watts in regard to the latent power of steam, as to which diff erent opinions had been given
Watt showed himself a man of penetrating genius in many branches of science…
In this way, Kelvin publicly celebrated Watt as, like Regnault, a great master of physical science, which quality rendered him, as an engineer, a great benefac- tor to humanity
It is worth observing, incidentally, in relation to the themes of Chapter 2 above, that Victor Regnaults endorsement of  ‘Watts Law was, given Regnaults famously defi nitive work on steam, an important instance of the modernization of Watts original, chemically-based steam experiments that obscured the original meaning of that (1)(2)
In May 1901 we fi nd Kelvin reading Muirheads Life of James Watt with much interest preparatory to giving an oration on Watt at the Glasgow Uni- versity Jubilee celebrations the following month
Kelvins letterbook of the period contains his draft  of the oration, which was delivered on 12 June 1901
Once again the Scotsman reported fully on the event
While Kelvins draft  ora- tion, and its published version,65 had a great deal to say about the origins and manifestations of Watts scientifi c approach to steam engineering, telling a fairly comprehensive tale up to Watts departure for England, the oration as delivered may have been somewhat briefer
Certainly, the Scotsman stressed those sections of it which displayed Kelvins claims about Watts prescience in relation to recent developments
Th us it reported that, having mentioned Watts experiments with a Papins digester and a syringe in the early 1760s, Kelvin remarked that that simple arrangement had formed the basis of engines ever since: Precisely that single-acting, high-pressure, syringe engine, made and experimented on by James Watt one hundred and forty years ago in his Glasgow College workshop, now in 1901, with the addition of a surface- condenser cooled by air to receive the waste steam, and a pump to return the water thence to the boiler, constituted the common road motor, which, in the opinion of many good judges, was the most suc- cessful of all the diff erent forms which had been made and tried within the last few years
Th us, Kelvin held up Watt as responsible not only for the improved steam engine of the nineteenth century but also for the anticipated steam motor vehicle of the twentieth
When Kelvin spoke, the battle between steam, electric and internal- combustion engines was in fact still being fought and his projection of steam as potential victor in that contest, unlike his award of credit for it to the Watt of the 1760s, was not unreasonable
Kelvin suggested that Watt should be regarded as responsible for other later engines too: Without a condenser, Watts high-pressure, single-acting engine of 1761 only needed the cylinder cover with piston-rod passing steam-tight through it (as introduced by Watt himself in subsequent developments), and the valves proper for admitting steam on both sides of the piston, and for working expansively, to make it the very engine [
] which, during the whole of the past century, had done practically all the steam work of the world, and was doing it still … Even the double and triple and quadruple expansion engines, by which the highest modern economy for power and steam engines had been obtained, were splendid mechanical developments of expan- sion, discovered and published by Watt, and used, though to a comparatively limited extent, in his own engines
Kelvin really was drawing a long bow here
Th e message, however, was clear – Watt had discovered the fundamental physical principles through his experi- ments; all else was mechanical development
Th is was the sense in which Watt had been a superior engineering scientist
Kelvin ended his address by referring to the forthcoming completion of an institution, funded by the generosity of Andrew Carnegie and designed to benefi t the world by scientifi c research – the ‘magnifi cent James Watt Engineering Laboratory of the University of (1)(2)
Th e reporter for the Scotsman remarked upon the way Kelvin had held the audiences attention with his ‘keen and living interest … in his subject, as for some long-standing personal friend
Kelvins ‘eager solicitude in presenting the life work and trials of Watt in a way that ‘occasionally almost outran his physical powers was very striking
In impressing his audience in this way, the great man indulged, from my perspective, in an orgy of presentist history of the same sort that had already, in the nineteenth century, disguised Watt the chemist as energy physicist and proto-thermodynamicist
Powerful economic and social forces were involved in the varied designation of Watt as engineer
We have seen enough examples now to conclude that in the nineteenth century the character of Watt was extremely malleable, ranging from the discoverer and philosophical engineer at one end of the spectrum, through the engineer with a scientifi c approach, to the craft sman-engineer at the other
Th at character was moulded to varied purposes by diff erent individuals and groups
Th e image of him as a craft sman-engineer appealed to, and affi  rmed the identity of, those tens of thousands of working engineers who constructed and tended the machines of the workshop of the world
Watt shared their skills, if possessing them in a highly refi ned degree that amounted to a true genius for contrivance
On the other hand were those who, whilst conceding Watts gen- ius for contrivance, found the source of his most important inventions in his philosophical character
Th e professionalization of academic engineering, and the need of scientifi c elites for practical affi  rmations of their importance, gave impetus to the varied construction of Watt as a ‘philosophical engineer, as a ‘profound engineer and as an ‘engineering scientist
In this elevation of the pro- found engineer the designation of Watt as a superfi cial chemist was confi rmed and entrenched
More than this, in a world of engineering that by the 1870s included the electrical and in which the doctrine of the equivalence of energy ruled, it was entirely appropriate that the mechanical Watt should also become – in the hands of the designators of standard units – the electrical ‘Watt
What all these characterizations have in common is that they are remarkably non- specifi c about what manner of science Watts was
Such vagueness allowed the nineteenth-century hearer or reader to supply his or her own estimation, and led inevitably to the modernization of the ‘Great Steamer
Th e nineteenth century created Watt in its own images
By that point he had been truly cut free from eighteenth-century realities
– 85 – 4 WATTS CHEMISTRY OF HEAT I argued in Chapter 2 that the realities of Watts chemical work and under- standings were obscured in the nineteenth century by his own narratives of his invention, and by the ‘water controversy
In the latter, elite scientists, such as members of the Cambridge group and the leadership of the Chemical Society, sided with Cavendish and condemned Watts chemistry as archaic, more of a stain on his reputation than a valuable addition to it
Watts supporters, on the other hand, made their claim for their hero in a way that artifi cially and inci- dentally modernized the nature of his chemical claims and arguments (as well as Cavendishs)
It remains a diffi  cult task to understand Watts chemistry on its own terms, but in this chapter I will make an attempt
I am guided by a convic- tion that it is a mistake to separate in an a priori fashion, as authors usually do, Watts philosophical (or theoretical) chemistry and his practical chemistry
Th at mistake is probably predicated also on the belief that Watt failed as a chemical theorist (that is in his public venture into the chemistry of water and airs), while still doing interesting things as an ingenious ‘cookbook chemist with glazes, var- nishes, inks, bleaching agents, medically promising airs and, of course, steam
Th e bifurcated approach to Watts chemistry is misleading on two counts
First, a number of Watts practical ventures did draw upon his theoretical ideas
Second, there is a good case for seeing Watts chemical ideas as in turn evolving as a result of his practical engagements
We will see in detail in this chapter and the next that Watts experiments on steam, undertaken in part to inform his attack on the practical problem of steam engine improvement led him to develop a chemistry of heat that went beyond that of his mentor Joseph (1)(2)
Watt was thoroughly convinced that there was a connection between the chem- istry of steam and the chemistry of airs
In fact ice, water, steam, mist, water vapour, common air and other airs were all subject to the chemistry of heat and their practical and theoretical study was interrelated as a result
Th is inoscula- tion of the practical and theoretical also occurred in other of Watts ventures
His contribution to pneumatic medicine in collaboration with Th omas Bed- does in the 1790s, for example, is usually seen as a practical one consisting mainly of improved methods for producing and delivering airs
However, as Trevor Levere and I have shown recently,2 Watt deployed theoretical ideas  about airs in that project
Moreover, those ideas had continued to evolve and  seem to have been crucially supplemented by notions about solutions garnered  from the French chemist Berthollet during Watts involvement with chemical  bleaching in the late 1780s
In what follows, then, I will try to remain open to the idea that the theoreti- cal Watt and the ‘cookbook chemist Watt were the same person and so able to  draw on each other
In all this though there is a caution to be added about Watt  the chemist
Although Watt worked with, adhered to and developed the Black- ian chemistry of heat throughout his active working life, he was not a systematic  chemist
Nor did he take all available opportunities to mix with those who were  engaged with chemistry in a more systematic and sustained fashion
He appears  to have read widely and operated in a magpie-like fashion, picking up bright new  ideas that seemed useful to him and endeavouring to deploy them in his accounts  and practices
Working in this way was probably partly an issue of temperament,  but it was not discouraged by the complex, confused state that chemistry was in  during the later eighteenth century
Looking backwards we can see Watt as one  of many who sought to hybridize the ‘old and the ‘new chemistry
We will see,  for example, that he was willing, eventually, to accept the discovery of oxygen  but did not regard that as entailing abandonment of belief in ‘phlogiston
While  from the position of an unwavering devotee of the new chemistry, or of the old,  such a position seemed nonsensical, at the time it was a viable one, since what the  new chemistry was to be was still being decided
Watts intermediate or hybrid  status as a chemist undid his chemical reputation in the long term
However,  it was a position shared with others of his circle, notably Joseph Priestley, but  also James Hutton, another who admitted oxygen but retained phlogiston
Even  Erasmus Darwin, who is usually seen as a convert to the Lavoisian scheme, is  revealed when examined closely as only partially so
He too was a hybrid, though  one closer to the Lavoisian end of the spectrum than Watt, Priestley or (1)(2)
In treating Watt and others as hybrids in this fashion, however, there is a dan- ger of missing what is probably a deeper divide between the defenders and the  opponents of phlogiston
We might consider those concerned with the chemistry  of airs in the later eighteenth century as divided among ‘lumpers and ‘splitters
Th e splitters were inclined to see the new airs being discovered as having distinct  chemical identities
Th e lumpers, on the other hand, whilst they might admit that  there were distinct airs (and even that the population of known airs was increas- ing) still believed in the fundamental unity of various families of airs
Watt and  Priestley were lumpers, Lavoisier and exponents of the new chemistry were split- ters
Richard Hills presents Black as a splitter but, as we will see, he could also  be readily characterized as a lumper
Lumpers appealed to unifying agents
Th is  might be phlogiston or heat, the variability of airs being due to the amounts of  heat combined with a ‘base of some sort
Th e unifying agent might be dealt with as a ‘principle
De Lucs use of the idea of ‘humor as the principle of humidity  – which we will come across because Watt adopted it – was another example of  a lumping device
Th e example of ‘humor – the common basis of air, water, and  water vapour – also shows how lumping was a tendency across other boundaries  that we tend to assume the existence of
Th us the boundary between air (gas) and  vapour (for example steam) was recognized in the sense that the former would  not condense, but they were also lumped together as ‘elastic fl uids
Th eir dif- ferences might be overcome if extreme enough conditions of temperature and  pressure were available
Airs would condense if low enough temperatures could  be reached
Water, and vapours, would become airs if high enough temperatures  (and low enough pressures) were involved
In this sense a chemistry of principles  still had a strong pull on the minds of many pneumatic chemists
I will begin by investigating Watts chemical apprenticeship with Joseph  Black and the ideas and practices that the young Watt would have been exposed  to
Th is is the context of his fi rst steam experiments
A second phase of Watts  chemical work came aft er his removal to Birmingham and involved a very close  working relationship with Joseph (1)(2) Th is was the period of the publi- cation of his ideas about the chemistry of water
Finally I will look at Watts evolving chemical ideas from the late 1780s into the early 1800s
Watts ‘Apprenticeship with Joseph Black Th e problem with much of the work on Watts inquiries into heat is that it  fails to take seriously the nature and the lasting consequences of Watts early nat- ural philosophical beliefs
We need to be alert to what Watt could think between  1760 and 1800 when he was active in relation to the steam engine, and to be so  alert we must understand his relationship with the great chemist Joseph Black,  and with the tradition to which Black belonged
Black and his circle present a historiographical problem that has never been  tackled so far as Watt is concerned
However, some time ago historians began  to confront similar problems for certain of Watts friends and contemporaries
James Hutton is an interesting case, not least because his famous theory of the  earth was wrested from context in a way similar to the fate of Watts work on  steam
Restoring the appropriate context in Huttons case also involved under- standing the importance of his chemical theory of heat
Patsy Gerstner argued  back in 1968 for the importance of Huttons theory of heat to his theory of the  earth
Arthur Donovan subsequently explained why this fact was given little  prominence in the accounts of Huttons theory developed by his disciples, nota- bly John Playfair and Sir James (1)(2) As Donovan characterizes the problem: ‘to  perceive the origins of Huttons theory, and more particularly its relation to the  older chemical tradition, we must fi rst penetrate the historical smoke screens  thrown up by the revolution in chemistry and the birth of geology
Between the 1750s and the 1790s a group of Scottish natural philosophers, of which both Hutton and Watt were a part, pursued a ‘chemical theory of heat – that is, in Donovans terms they treated heat as a material substance involved in chemical processes
Th eir ideas were rooted in the Boerhaavian tradition and the ideas of other continental chemical natural philosophers, partially medi- ated by William Cullen, treating heat, or fi re more generally, as chemically responsible for the state of material bodies
Th us Huttons theory of forces used the ideas of specifi c and latent heats but in a way that looked back to the ear- lier days rather than forward to their subsequent meanings
Hutton deployed specifi c and latent heats as parts of the ‘repulsive force or what he called the ‘solar substance
For Hutton, specifi c heat was a ‘principle7 infl uencing volume, latent heat was the principle of fl uidity
Together with light and electricity these made up the repulsive force
So for Hutton latent heat causes fl uidity and spe- cifi c heat causes expansion
Th e dynamics of natural cycles of rock formations are largely explained in these terms within his theory
It is for this reason that Donovan claims that Huttons theory of the earth is given its dynamics by Hut- tons chemical theory of heat
Huttons theory was subsequently reinterpreted and reshaped to fi nd hon- our and application in a world where a recent revolution in chemistry and the ambitions of the exponents of an independent science of geology were powerful intellectual forces
Th at was how Huttons chemical theory of heat disappeared from his theory of the earth as published and expounded by his followers
For them the chemical theory of heat was an excisable irrelevance and embarrass- ment
Similarly, I argue, the intellectual foundations of Watts chemistry (set in place in the late 1750s and 1760s, and developing with the work of his friend Black) and their importance to his steam-engine work, have been obscured by both the chemical revolution of the late eighteenth century and by seeing Watts engine work through the lens of subsequent theories of heat engines and ther- modynamics
So let us turn now to Watts ‘apprenticeship to (1)(2)
Th at Watt did serve an informal chemical apprenticeship under Black is certainly true, if distressingly hard to document in real time
Th ere is little doc- umentary evidence of their relationship before Black moved to Edinburgh in 1766
However, there was much more to their relationship than master–appren- tice
In their edition of the letters of Watt and Black, Robinson and McKie painted an infl uential picture of the relationship between the two men as ‘Part- ners in Science
Yet their perspective on the relationship drew not only from the marvellous variety of the (post-1766) correspondence but also from the vexed historiography of the partnership that the nineteenth century had generated
Th us, overall, Robinson and McKie characterized the relationship as an ‘associa- tion between the most eminent chemist of Europe, which meant, at that time, the world, and Europes greatest engineer
Approaching their relationship in this way is to prejudge too much
We become predisposed to regard Black as inhabiting the world of ‘theory and Watt that of ‘practice
We are encouraged to see Black as a cosmopolitan fi gure of the Scottish Enlightenment and Watt as a clever engineer hanging from his coattails, their relationship involving a ‘transfer of intellect to craft
Th is is a mistake
Th ere is a case to be made that in some respects Watt was, through much of their association, more of a chemist than (1)(2) Th e professor made his key discoveries early in life
His move to Edinburgh in 1766 was, as Donovan tells us, ‘the end of his career as a creative philosophical chemist
Black was remark- ably reticent about publication – Watt and others constantly cajoled him to claim what was his – and he exerted his primary infl uence orally, as a teacher of generations of students in Glasgow and then in (1)(2)12 A proportion of those students made signifi cant contributions to the science of chemistry them- selves and oft en acknowledged a great debt to their teacher, but that teacher was himself remarkably absent from the public ‘conversation and the great debates occurring in chemistry in the late eighteenth century
Watt did not publish a great deal either and, as we have noted, his chemical work was episodic and undisciplined, but he collaborated not only with Black but also with Priestley, DeLuc and Beddoes, and he had some claim to the discovery of the compound nature of water
He met, and discussed the chemistry of the day with, Lavoisier, Berthollet, Laplace and many others, wrote a circulated response to the new chemical nomenclature proposed by Hassenfratz and Adet, and was known as a defender of phlogiston theory
In short, Watt might reasonably be regarded as a more active chemist than Black in the later decades of the eighteenth century
We will see that in important respects he did more than Black ever did to explore the wider chemical ramifi cations of the chemistry of latent heat
Having said this, we must remember that for Black the ‘chemical life was focused through the relationship that he had with his students
Th ey became the key vehicle for the communication of his ideas
Black had taken up the example set by William Cullen in this respect
Just as Cullen had cultivated his relationship with stu- dents, some of whom became almost collaborators (including Black), when they were invited into the laboratory, so Black did too
Robison and William Irvine (as students) and Watt (on a diff erent basis) became experimental apprentices to Black within this tradition
Th e distance between Black and Watt is also reduced when we recognize that Black had an entrepreneurial side, or at least an interest in funding practi- cal, potentially profi table projects
Th e fi rst partnership between Black and Watt was in late 1759 when Watt, Alexander Wilson and Black associated in a venture to produce improved clocks
Other partnerships involving the two men (some- times with other parties) included a hardware shop and a scheme for producing alkali from salt
When Watt moved his business into the precincts of Glasgow University at the end of July 1757, he had a number of connections with the professor- ate there, especially with John Anderson, Professor of Natural Philosophy from 1757, and Alexander Wilson, who became Professor of Practical Astronomy in 1760
Black was appointed to the Chair of Medicine at Glasgow in early 1757
Few records of this early period of their relationship survive – understandably, the all-important letters between them only begin in earnest aft er Blacks move to Edinburgh in 1766
We do know that at Glasgow Watt was repairing lecture equipment for Black in October 1757 and undertook other commissions for him
Robison, whose own association with Black and Watt began the following year, later suggested that Watt ‘was much with the (1)(2) during his most important researches (that is, Blacks researches on heat which were conducted in the early 1760s), but the truth of this is unknown
If we are to believe Watts claim that he only learned of latent heat from Black aft er he had conducted his own experi- ments revealing the phenomenon, then it seems unlikely because Watts own experiments post-dated Blacks
At the very least, though, and as Watt repeatedly acknowledged, he did acquire much knowledge from Black (though through informal contact rather than formal study) and learned from him ‘the correct modes of reasoning, and of making experiments
Chemistry was to change a great deal during Watts lifetime, but his basic approach to the subject was laid down in the late 1750s and early 1760s dur- ing his association with (1)(2) In his turn, Black had imbibed the approach and interests of his predecessor William Cullen, with whom he had studied and worked as an assistant
So far as the study of heat was concerned, Cullens key publication appeared in 1756(1) For him, as for Black and Watt at this time the basic form of chemical inquiry was still set by Hermann Boerhaaves New Method of Chemistry, in which the fi eld was described as the manipulation of the four elements in menstruums contained in vessels
Blacks instrumental armamentarium included furnaces (which Watt helped to repair, redesign and rebuild) and an array of ordinary household equipment, including kettles
Where Black diff ered in approach from Boerhaave, according to Cardwell, was in not concerning himself much with the metaphysics of causal agents, nota- bly ‘fi re
Instead, Black developed quantitative investigations of operationalized concepts of temperature and heat
Th is set the basic format of Watts chemis- try too
From the beginning, his experiments on steam were quantitative in this same fashion
While Cardwells identifi cation of this form of chemical investiga- tion is certainly correct, it is a mistake, I think, to argue from it that Black was a ‘positivist
In making this claim, Cardwell and Hills (and also Donovan) suggest that Black approached the study of heat in a way that presaged nineteenth-cen- tury thermodynamics
Hills, drawing on Donovan, put it this way: in dealing with heat, Black was looking for general laws which would explain changes in the states of matter and was not trying to suggest a new theory of heat
He applied general laws of heat, fl ow, change of state and so on to particular cases dealing with specifi c substances and in this he had much more affi  nity with nineteenth century physicists who developed the study of thermodynamics than with his contemporary fellow chemists
It is true that Black did little himself to develop the consequences of the chemis- try of heat for the chemistry of gases and of other substances
But that does not mean that for him heat was a physical externality to chemical process
On the contrary, as Golinski puts it: Although Black imported thermometric techniques into chemistry from other physi- cal sciences, to describe his view of heat as “physical” would be inaccurate
Rather as chemistry was understood in terms of heat, so heat was understood by Black in terms of chemistry
As Robison clarifi ed, Black perceived the latent presence of heat in bod- ies in terms of its chemical combination with ponderable matter…
Th e fact is that Black failed to put his conception of latent heat to work in accounting for other chemical phenomena, whether because his energies were diverted from novel investigations or because of his much vaunted reluctance to build systems
In this sense his lectures on heat remained peculiarly disengaged from the rest of the substance of his chemical lectures
Nevertheless it was the chemical combination of heat with other matter that explained for Black the nature of fl uidity
Even as he shared the Boerhaavian conception of chemistry as the operations of heat, Black moved away from Boerhaaves treatment of heat as an external ‘instrument, embracing the idea that heat participated in chemical combinations
Having sided with Golinski (and against Cardwell and Dono- van) on this point, I would nevertheless concede that defending either position is very diffi  cult because of the lack of relatively unmediated access to Blacks work
Because of his reluctance to publish, we see his work only through fi lters provided by others, especially (1)(2) Th ose fi lters were activated in part by events subsequent to Blacks experiments and discoveries, by solicitude for the reputation of a departed friend, by the local and international politics of science, indeed by international politics as such
Th ese contrasting historical interpretations of Black mirror the diff erent ways in which his ‘disciples developed the chemistry of heat, and of latent heat in particular
Th us William Irvines non-chemical theory of latent heat did indeed take Blacks ideas into a form readily assimilable to the early nineteenth-century transformation of heat into a physical instrument of chemical change
In drawing lines from Black to proto-thermodynamic thinking, ‘Irvinism was the conduit
Th is is true, I think, even though, as Robert Fox long ago showed, Irvinist con- ceptions of heat were under apparently fatal attack from French investigators aft er the fi rst decade of the nineteenth century
Although Fox, with some reason, fi nds the rearguard defence of Irvinism to involve ‘muddled thinking in a situ- ation of ‘hopelessness by the 1820s,26 its doctrines had already generated a view of Blacks achievement that swept to one side the importance of his chemical theory of heat, adding to the real historical force of Robisons attribution of a positivist approach to Black in his publication of Blacks (1)(2) It was these developments, rather than those in France, which were just beginning to repudi- ate Irvinism directly, that were uppermost in Watts mind in the very early 1800s as he refashioned his own experiments on steam for posterity
At this juncture a little more needs to be said about (1)(2)
William Irvine was a native of Glasgow, matriculating at the university at the age of thirteen in 1756
Black soon noticed his interest in chemistry and his disposition to apply mathematics in his studies
Like Black, Irvines main lines of communication for his work were through his students and the occasional excursion before the local Philosophical (1)(2) Working as Blacks assistant, Irvine helped in his professors determination of the latent heat of steam and contributed values of that quantity for melting tin, zinc and spermaceti and beeswax
He also worked with Black on establishing experimentally the specifi c heats of various substances
However, Irvine became very much his own man
Andrew Kent puts it colourfully: Irvine … laboured long and eff ectively in support of his teachers enquiries; but fol- lowing Blacks departure for Edinburgh, this spagyric Man Friday showed a stubborn originality in the interpretation of their results
He found Blacks theory of Latent Heat unwelcome for various reasons
It presumed a material view of Heat where the younger man was anxious to preserve an open mind: it ascribed a duality of character to Heat as ‘free or ‘combined, which Irvine was anxious to avoid
Black agreed that the doctrine taught by his successor was “an ingenious thought”, but genially main- tained his own opinion
Irvines ‘ingenious thought was that latent heat was the diff erence in heat con- tent of two phases of a substance at the same temperature
Th us, at the moment when a substance moved from solid to liquid its heat capacity increased instanta- neously
Th is, according to him, rather than any process of chemical combination of heat with the substance, explained the extra heat required to support a change of phase
Irvine also used considerations of specifi c heat to derive a value for absolute zero of temperature
Th e fact that Watt defended Irvines priority in this against other claimants assures us that Watt was entirely familiar with Irvines ideas
Watt defended Irvine, as well as Black, against those who, like Adair Crawford,29 appropriated his ideas
In about 1769 Irvine and Watt worked together on ‘manganese as a colourant in glass manufacture
Th ey also worked together on heat – many of the tabulations of results from Watts experiments in the early 1770s on the latent heat of steam at diff erent pressures are recorded in Irvines hand
However, for all his respect for Irvine, Watts development of the Black tradition, like James Huttons, unambiguously embraced the chemical conception of latent heat that Irvine rejected
For Watt as for Joseph Black, the issue of the chemical nature of water, steam and air was closely tied up with the understanding of heat
Th eir laboratory work at Glasgow in the early 1760s was concerned in various ways with the heating of water, and especially with what we would call ‘changes of state, a notion that we must be very careful not to attribute to them since they did not share our conception of a ‘gaseous state
Th is becomes clear when we realize that for them the composition and decomposition of water was to be conceived of as involv- ing the same sorts of processes in the changing of water into air and air into water
Watts work on the composition of water, on the one hand, and his experi- ments on steam in relation to his engine improvements on the other, have been treated separately by historians, but I suggest that Watt himself, and his friends and associates made no such clear distinction  – there was an essential continuity between them
In his early Edinburgh lectures Joseph Black defi ned chemistry as ‘the Study of the eff ects of Heat & Mixture on Bodies and Mixtures of Bodies, with a view to the improvement of our knowledge
Blacks lecture courses in chemistry always began with the topic of heat and, in fact, struggled to leave it behind
Blacks fi rst chemistry lectures were delivered in Glasgow in 1757–8, and his association with James Watt, who had set up shop as an instrument maker within the University of Glasgow, dates from this time also
Blacks work on heat was partly inspired by the experiments of his predecessor as Professor at Glasgow, William Cullen, on evaporative cooling and partly by meditations on processes of freezing(1) Black became convinced that processes of freezing and vaporization involved large quantities of heat well beyond those that ought to be required according to prevailing ideas
His fi rst major experiments on raising the temperature of water and ice were conducted in 1761, and a year later he performed experiments on vaporization
From these experiments, values were obtained for the quantity of heat required for (what would later be called) latent heat of fusion and of vaporization
In the winter, spring and summer of 1764 Watt performed a series of experi- ments of his own on steam
He fi rst became involved in this work through his famous eff orts to repair a model of a Newcomen engine undertaken as part of his duties as instrument maker to the University of (1)(2) He was able to show that steam could heat about six times its own weight of water to boiling point
In working that model engine Watt was struck by the surprisingly large quantities of cold water needed to condense the steam in the cylinder
Watt mentioned this result to Black, who then explained the idea of latent heat
Th e precise relation- ship between the concept of latent heat and Watts steam engine work is very controversial, as we have seen
My immediate concern, however, is to emphasize the fact that from 1764 Watts work on heat was undertaken as part of Blacks tradition of work
Black always made prominent reference to Watts experiments in his lectures at Edinburgh University so far as we can rely on Robisons edition of Blacks lectures
Blacks departure for Edinburgh in 1766 obviously reduced his personal con- tact with Watt, but they corresponded with reasonable frequency
Th e chemical aspect of their correspondence is oft en of a very practical kind, with Black ask- ing for equipment or requesting specimens
But the topic of heat lay close to the surface
Practical matters could easily raise important theoretical issues
For example, when Watt ventured into the production of Delft  pottery he con- ducted lengthy experiments with diff erent designs of kiln, with the use of coke instead of coals to fuel the kiln, and also with glazes of various sorts
He sought Blacks help and reassurance on many of these matters
Informed of Watts puz- zling over the uneven heating of a kiln fuelled by coke, Black reminded him that whilst the fl ames of coals represented the fl ow of heat, coke communicated heat in a way more like the heat from the sun
Black reminded Watt of Nollets experi- ment with mirrors, a glowing piece of charcoal and a sample of gunpowder, in which the latter was ignited by communicating the heat of the glowing char- coal from the focus of one mirror to that of the other
Watt responded to being alerted to what he called the ‘beaming of the glowing coke by redesigning the kiln to incorporate a metal grid that would in eff ect relay the beaming of the heat and ensure a more even heating of the kiln
Th is is a good example of their theoretically informed and guided practical work
Th e systematic unravelling of much of Watts cookbook chemistry would, I think, reveal similar strategies and processes oft en at play
Although Watt never systematically laid out his ideas on the composition and fi ring of diff erent clays and glazes, for example, it would be surprising if there too his ideas about heat as transformative agent were not involved
We have yet to discern, I suspect, many of the underlying theoretical threads of Watts cookbook chemistry
Aft er Watt moved to Birmingham in 1774 he remained loyal to the Blackian tradition
Th us, for example, in 1779 he reported to Black that he was standing fi rm against those who challenged him with a non-material theory of heat: I am most sadly teased with the philosophers in this country and their theorys of heat being only a vibration in bodies which seems to me highly improbable and not to be reconciled to many notorious facts – I see Macquer has defended it ably but has brought no conviction to me – I think that latent heat and diff erence of equilibrium will account for all its phenomena except the heat produced by friction there I am at a loss
A few years later, when Lavoisier and Laplaces memoir on heat was published, Watt ensured that Black received a copy and told his friend that the piece was well-written ‘though not free from objections
He lamented the fact that the authors did not mention Blacks name, though Black was himself partly to blame for this by not publishing
Nevertheless Watt believed that Blacks ideas would prevail: ‘I think that as far as I can see into the matter that (1)(2) Irvines doctrines and (1)(2) Crawfords of capacity, will fall to the ground, and your original theory of Latent or essential heat be established
For Watt and Black, then, the phenomena of heat were integral to chemi- cal processes
David (1) Dyck in an unpublished PhD thesis gave a very useful account of Watts chemical work in which he made a number of very important points about the connection between Watts work on steam and that on water
Dyck discerned that Watts explanation of the composition of water had in part grown out of ideas about the relationships of water, air and fi re that existed in older traditions
Watt long believed that if water could be heated enough it would change not just into steam but ultimately into air
We will see that this idea had proximate causes for Watt, but in its general form, Dyck ventures, Watt could have acquired it from the German medical man and chemist Johann Th eodor Eller39 who suggested in 1746 that water is converted into air by combination with elementary fi re
As Hélène Metzger long ago discussed, the early decades of Watts interest in chemistry and heat (the 1750s through the 1770s) saw a prolif- eration of ideas about entities actively involved in chemical reactions including not only phlogiston but also heat (fi re) and light
Herman Boerhaave, the great Dutch physician and chemist had identifi ed fi re as the source of fl uidity in water
Eller was a student of Boerhaave as was (1)(2) Boerhaaves infl uence in Scottish medicine and chemistry was very strong
So whilst we lack direct evidence that Watt imbibed his ideas from Boerhaave and Eller via Cullen and Black, there is considerable circumstantial evidence to suggest that this was so
Watt read widely and was well aware of Boerhaaves New Method of Chemistry and other infl uential chemical works
Watt, like Black, was committed to one of three major views of heat extant at the time
Th e fi rst of the three views was that heat was motion, or the vibra- tion of the parts of ordinary material bodies
Th is mechanical theory of heat had been favoured by Boyle and had been endorsed by (1)(2) But the mechanical theory was not fashionable in the mid- to late eighteenth century
We know that a mathematical theory of heat as motion was developed by Henry Cavendish in the 1780s but, typically, not published
Th is type of theory was, of course, to become the ‘correct view of heat by the mid-nineteenth century
Th e sec- ond and third accounts of heat are oft en collapsed together as ‘material theories since in both heat was a special substance rather than the motion of ordinary matter
Th e distinction between these two material theories is clearly described by McCormmach: In one version, when fi re is in a free state, its particles move rapidly in all directions, their motion registering as sensible heat; the particles lose their motion when they combine with particles of ordinary bodies, in which state fi re loses its property of sensible heat
In the other version, the particles of fi re do not enter into combination with those of ordinary bodies, and fi re always retains the property of sensible heat; because diff erent bodies have diff erent capacities for heat, an addition of the same quantity of fi re results in diff erent increases in sensible heat
Joseph Black subscribed to a version of the fi rst material theory
He considered heat to be a special form of matter that combined with ordinary matter as a result of chemical forces of attraction
Th e phenomenon of cold produced by evaporation was explained by Black as follows
Th e cold experienced when water evaporates is the result of the water absorbing sensible heat as the water becomes vapour
Th e heat is not lost, rather the heat combines chemically with the vapour and it is this that gives the vapour the property of elasticity
Th us water absorbs the matter of heat, which becomes latent (or ‘fi xed as Black termed it initially) because it is now chemically combined with the water
Th rough this combina- tion, the latent heat confers the property of fl uidity or elasticity upon the vapour, that is upon the steam
Th is account seems strange to us
We are accustomed to thinking of Black as ‘the discoverer of latent heat, and by this we usually mean the discoverer of what we understand by the term ‘latent heat
But this is quite wrong
Our concept of latent heat is underwritten by a kinetic theory of heat; Blacks was based on a material (chemical) one in which latent heat was intrinsic to chemical reactions and was compounded with ordinary matter
Th e fact that Black has a conception of latent heat ‘foreign to us is made clear by the terms in which Blacks support- ers stated and defended his claims
Th us, in his Encyclopaedia Britannica article on ‘Steam Robison described Black as having ‘justly concluded that, water diff ered from ice at the same temperature by containing as a constituent ingre- dient, a great quantity of fi re, or of the cause of heat, united with it in such a way as not to quit it for another colder body, and therefore so as to not go into the liquor of the thermometer and expand it
Considered therefore as the possible cause of heat … if any more heat was added to the water it was not latent, but would readily quit it for the thermometer, and, by expanding the thermometer, would show what is the degree of this redundant heat, while fl uidity alone is the indication of the combined and latent heat
Once again, Robison, in defending Black against what he took to be De Lucs unjustifi ed pretensions to have made the discovery, stated that Black was ‘the fi rst Man who had conceived Heat or Fire as a constituent part of all Fluid and Gases
We can now begin to appreciate what Watt meant when he discussed water, steam and air
Watt characterized his long-held views on the relations of water and air in a letter to Matthew Boulton in 1782: You may remember that I have oft en said that if water could be heated red-hot or some- thing more, it would probably be converted into some kind of air, because steam would in that case have lost all its latent heat, and that it would have been turned solely into sensible heat, and probably a total change of the nature of the fl uid would ensue
Watt expressed the same idea in a letter to Black at the same time
Writing about what he saw as his own contributions to their joint eff orts, Watt explained: What … I think my own, is the trying the experiment on the latent heat in vacuo and the fi nding it to be greater than under the pressure of the Atmosphere – Th e exp[erimen]ts to ascertain the diff erent degrees of heat at which water boils under diff erent pressures – the expansion which steam in its perfect state receives from heat and the experiments on the bulk of water when converted into steam together with a theory which I have devised which accounts for the boiling heats of the water not following a Geometrical progression, and showing that as steam parts with its latent heat as it acquires sensible heat or is more compressed, that when it arrives at a certain point it will have no latent heat and may under proper compression be an elastic fl uid nearly as specifi cally heavy as water and at which point I conceive it will again change its state and become something else than steam or water
My Opinion has been that it would then become air, which many things had led me to conclude…
When Watt published on the composition of water in the Philosophical Transac- tions he was to drop this specifi c idea
However, even as he suggested there that water is produced by the sparking of infl ammable and dephlogisticated airs, in a way that involves latent heat less directly, he still retained a central chemical role for heat in the process
By the time of this accounting of the joint eff orts of Black and himself, in 1782, Watts chemical interests had been rekindled aft er a period of desuetude in the later 1770s when he was preoccupied with the hands-on management of the steam engine business, especially in (1)(2) But by 1780 the most diffi  cult years were behind Boulton and Watt, and Watt was beginning another phase of chemical work during which he entered new collaborative relationships
How- ever, his communications with Black continued and were occasionally revealing of their chemical relations
Aft er Blacks death in 1799, his family raised the issue of the publication of his famous lectures
At fi rst there was some confusion about who would under- take this task
Adam Ferguson, Blacks obituarist for the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, was willing to produce a straightforward transcript of Blacks lectures
John Robison was also approached and declared himself avail- able, though he believed that Watt was the ideal man to do it
He put it to George Black Jr that ‘if Mr Watt would undertake it, there is not a Man living who can do it so well, or do it with more delight
He is my superior in chemi- cal knowledge and Experience, and was continually with your Uncle during his most original Researches
Watt refused to take on the task but agreed to meet Robison in Glasgow to consult on the transcription of the manuscript lectures
Robison still wanted to make use of Watt as the best person to help with interpre- tation of obscurities in the manuscripts
Th e plan to publish a ‘straightforward transcription could not survive an examination of the manuscripts, which were disorganized and written for oral delivery
Robison was also concerned about their lack of art or literary merit
Black had aimed to be understood by the least, and the least cultured, of his students
Transcribing such lectures would not do justice to Blacks memory, Robison thought
Th ey contrasted starkly with the art- ful, systematic texts of the French chemists
Th e lectures were also dated
Black had interpolated comments over the years on developments in the fi eld, but these were tacked onto an unchanging structure
Robison came to the view that Blacks interest in the cutting edge of chemistry had faded over the years
He had failed, because of this and because of declining health, to respond in any substantial, or critical fashion to the chemistry of (1)(2) Robison was disappointed to see that Black had uncritically imported swathes of French chemistry into his lectures, which sat incongruously beside more traditional ideas
Th is too led him to despair of the published lectures living up to Blacks great name
He was inclined to publish instead a compilation from Blacks important discoveries in a way that would do greater justice to his memory
In the end Watt made a sug- gestion that seemed a reasonable and viable compromise
As Robison explained Watts idea: ‘He considers it as a History of Chemistry, for forty years, by one of its greatest Masters
Th e lack of system was true to Blacks suspicion of intellectual systems in general – the defi ciency could be made a virtue of and even elevated to the status of a methodological precept
Blacks Lectures, as edited by Robison, have been the source of much of the historiographical confusion about the relationship between Watt and (1)(2) As we have already seen, Watt did not like the way that Robison ended up portray- ing his dependence on (1)(2) Watts displeasure came to Robisons notice as soon as Watt became aware that the Lectures had been dedicated to him as a pupil of (1)(2) Watt apparently repudiated the idea to others in conversation, which Robison learned about: A Gentleman told me that he [Watt] said in a company of several Persons that he never was a Pupil of Black, I am therefore mistaken as to that fact – of which I never doubted, having found him, on my return to College in 1763, most intimately connected with Dr Black, and continually speaking of his lectures and doctrines – possibly I took it for granted without its having been told me – But, even granting the mistake, as to his having regularly attended the Lectures, I must still consider (1)(2)
Watt as (1)(2) Blacks  most illustrious Pupil…
What we can say for certain is that Watt owed a great deal to Black for his ini- tiation into the science of chemistry
Watt took further than his master the commitment to a chemical theory of heat and the working out of its conse- quences
Watt took more seriously than his master the task of deciding what was useful in the new French chemistry and what had to be resisted
His conception of heat-content as a key diff erentiator between diff erent chemical substances, such as diff erent kinds of airs, grew out of these early experiences
So too, did the link in his mind between the chemistry of steam and the chemistry of airs, the idea of the essential unity of the chemistry of elastic fl uids
Watt, Priestley and the Philosophical Transactions Papers From about 1780 James Watts interest in chemistry revived strongly, and did so, I would claim, in connection with further steam engine innovation
In retro- spect Watt has oft en been seen as a conservative innovator
Th ere are a number of reasons for this perception, but a major one is his resistance to the idea of working engines at higher pressures
However, there are many signs that having got his fi rst engines running Watt was in fact very open to the possibility that steam-engine design might change radically
Some potential changes, like the possibility of using alternative airs as a basis for novel engines, he took seriously as a potential threat, at least for a while
Watts correspondence with Matthew Boulton at this time reveals that Joseph Priestley conducted experiments on their behalf to investigate the possibility of deriving mechanical power from the condensation of air, or of using in an engine any of the new airs recently discov- ered
Th e concern that others, notably the Hornblowers, might get a march on Boulton & Watt in this respect, just as their engines were beginning to pay, was soon dispelled, however
Boulton explained to Watt that he was ‘persuaded from Expmts made by (1)(2) (1) that non of his Airs will ever incommode us … nothing is to fear from any of the tribe of Gasses
Other possibilities for innovation lay in managing heat and steam diff erently, and Watt was more convinced than ever that knowing as much as possible about steam, and about airs, was crucially important
Watts intuition, I think, was that the understanding of steam was to be gained at the intersection of Blacks chemistry of heat and the chemistry of airs that Joseph Priestley had brought into his ambit in a newly-concentrated way when the radical divine arrived in Birmingham in 1780
Although, as we have seen, Watt remained in sporadic contact with Black, and continued to defend Blackian chemical views, Priestley was to be the touchstone of Watts chemical life from that time onwards
Priestley had settled in Fair Hills Birmingham sometime in September or October 1780
In establishing himself there, he had fi nancial support from Boulton and Darwin to help build and equip a new laboratory
Priestley was, of course, already very well known for his scientifi c discoveries
A number of the active members of the Lunar Society had corresponded with him, or discussed his work
Watt, for example, had shown great interest in 1773 in Priestleys discovery of nitrous oxide and his ideas about photosynthesis
Priestley was readily accepted as a member of the Lunar (1)(2) In fact the Societys day of meeting was changed from Sunday to Monday to accommodate his duties as a minister
In recalling those days, Priestley considered his settlement at Bir- mingham as ‘the happiest event of my life
His philosophical objectives were well served, he recalled, by the presence of ‘good workmen of every kind, and the society of persons eminent for their knowledge of chemistry, particularly (1)(2)
Watt, (1)(2) Keir and (1)(2) Withering
Th e fact that Priestley coupled Keir and Watt in this way is perhaps telling
Priestley had earlier asked Keir to read over his work, explaining privately to him that he was ‘afraid of tripping on chemical ground
Priestley regarded Keir as having chemical expertise beyond his own
Whilst it might not match Keirs, Watts status as a chemist in the estimation of his new collaborator was also clear
Th e new ‘lunatic showed great willingness to assist in the practical ventures of his fellows
Even if Priestley had not been inclined to help Boulton and Watt, Boultons patronage gave some leverage, which he was prepared to use if neces- sary
Th us, in relation to experiments on the possibilities of deriving mechanical power from the repeated condensation and vaporization of airs derived from fi xed alkali, Boulton wrote to Watt: I have placed a confi dence in Dr Priestley who hath seriously promised me to keep the secret & to give me all the facts and all he can discover in that line
Th e Dr is under some obligations to me that you know not of, & I think will not betray me, I am sure he will not
For his part, Watt was more unconditionally welcoming and Priestley became part of the Watt family circle
Th ey were to experiment together on numerous occasions
For example, Priestley collaborated with Watt and De Luc in experi- ments on heat, steam and evaporation in 1783, and there are indications that before and aft er this Priestley joined Watt at home in experimental work
Th ey also routinely shared news of each others ideas and experiments
Very early on, Priestley acknowledged the value of Watts comments on his work in volume 2 of his Experiments and Observations on Natural Philosophy, and a brief letter from Watt, among others, commenting on aspects of the content of that work was included in the Appendix added aft er Priestleys arrival in (1)(2) Given that the preface of Experiments and Observations was dated 24 March 1781, it is clear that Watt and Priestley ‘hit the ground running in their collabora- tion
Some of their ideas were perhaps converging at that time
Priestley noted in Experiments and Observations that in his fi rst volume he had ‘supposed heat to consist in a vibratory motion of the particles of bodies
He still believed this in 1781 so far as sensible heat was concerned but conceded that ‘there may be a principle of heat latent in bodies, and not manifest by any sensible eff ect
Heat may therefore be what is usually termed a substance
One of the main outcomes of Watts chemical activities in the early 1780s was his only high-profi le chemical publication, the paper off ering ‘Th oughts on the Constituent Parts of Water and of Dephlogisticated Air, which was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1784
Th is paper is, as we have seen, the chief basis for Watts claim to have discovered the composition of water
Whilst its importance in that connection is undeniable, discussion of it in relation to the water controversy has, I believe, contributed to the neglect of serious attempts to understand the complexities of the chemical views that it presents
Th is narrowness of focus has been engendered by a number of preoccupations of historians as they have examined the paper
One such concern is the question of priority of discovery – whether Watt, Cavendish, Priestley, Lavoisier or some other candidate should be awarded it
As a result Watts famous words in which he summarized his view of the composition of water have been extracted from the paper numerous times
Th ose words have been treated as isolated speculation – a bright idea suddenly arrived at – inspired by Priestleys experiments on spark- ing dephlogisticated and infl ammable air
Th e overall argument of the paper, and its intricacies, have been neglected
Watt had much more to say  – in fact most of the paper (eighteen of twenty-fi ve pages) was concerned with a sequence of experiments on dephlogisticated air, many of which Watt performed himself
Moreover, these experiments are not just additional matter
Once properly understood, they change the meaning of what Watt had to say about water
His was no simple, prescient fl ash of insight that water is compounded of two airs
It was an exploration of the relationship between air, water, earths, acids and heat
It did not treat dephlogisticated and infl ammable air as elementary build- ing blocks from which water was constructed, rather it invoked (as can be seen when we look closely) a chemistry of principles, centred on Jean André De Lucs notion of ‘humor
Although Priestley was an inspiration and sounding board, the work of many others is considered and refl ected in Watts writing, including, besides De Luc, Richard Kirwan, and Lavoisier and (1)(2) Th e paper repre- sents, then, a curious unstable synthesis of Watts and Blacks work on latent heat of steam, Priestleys and Watts investigations of airs, and De Lucs concept of humor which came from his meteorological writings on evaporation
Th e contentious story of the papers production has also distracted from seri- ous consideration of its substance
It began life as a letter from Watt to Priestley written in April 1783 and intended to accompany Priestleys report to the Royal Society of his original experiments on the seemingly direct production of air from water in an earthenware retort
Th at letter to Priestley circulated in Lon- don amongst Royal Society circles before Priestley retracted his claims about the experiment and Watt withdrew his letter
From these events stemmed the sub- sequent claims (from the Watt camp) that Cavendish and Lavoisier, both with the aid of Charles Blagden, plagiarized Watts ideas
Watt reworked his paper, removing the focus on the earthenware retort experiments, and presenting it this time in the form of a letter to De (1)(2) Th is letter, as published, is rendered a strange production by its consistent, extensive and explicit quotation from the earlier letter to Priestley – a device adopted because of the issues of priority that haunted its production
In what follows, I try to avoid the narrow focus that has hampered prior treatments of this paper
I consider it in its entirety, trying to appreciate its intellectual context and, by so doing, hope to advance our under- standing of Watts chemical thinking
Watts fi rst observation concerned the nature of infl ammable air, which Priestley, and before him Kirwan, had noted as seemingly identical to phlogiston – Priestley suggested that it was pure phlogiston, Kirwan that it was phlogiston in its gaseous state
For his part, Watt essentially concurred but believed that infl ammable air also contained ‘a small quantity of water and much elementary heat
Th e experimental basis for this belief lay in Priestleys experiments on heating metallic calces in an atmosphere of infl ammable air only
Th e fact that the calces were reduced to their metallic state and that the infl ammable air was consumed in the process led to the conclusion that infl ammable air must be, primarily, phlogiston
Watt then proceeded to consider the famous experiments in which dephlogisticated and infl ammable air were sparked together: Th e fi rst eff ect was the appearance of red heat or infl ammation in the airs, which was soon followed by the glass vessel becoming hot … and as the glass grew cool, a mist or visible vapour appeared in it, which was condensed on the glass in the form of moisture or dew
Th e moisture was water and found to be ‘equal in weight to the airs employed
Th at the airs had been consumed in the process was shown by the fact that, the containing vessel having its mouth placed under water or mercury, the vessel was almost completely fi lled with the fl uid
So what had happened here, according to Watt, was that the two kinds of air ‘unite with violence, they become red-hot, and upon cooling totally disappear
Th e only products are water, heat and light, the only product remaining at the end of proceedings being the water
Watt then off ered the famous, oft -quoted words: Are we not then authorised to conclude, that water is composed of dephlogisticated air and phlogiston, deprived of part of their latent or elementary heat; that dephlogisticated or pure air is composed of water deprived of its phlogiston, and united to elementary heat and light; and that the latter are contained in it in a latent state, so as not to be sensible to the thermometer or to the eye; and if light be only a modifi cation of heat, or a circumstance attending it, or a component part of the infl ammable air, then pure or dephlogisticated air is composed of water deprived of its phlogiston and united to elemen- tary heat
Th is section, itself italicized by Watt, is usually the only part of the paper quoted in discussions of the discovery of the composition of water
From it the nine- teenth-century or modern reader, given the later equation of dephlogisticated with oxygen and of phlogiston with hydrogen (infl ammable air), might be for- given for thinking that Watt had the composition of water right except for some excisable complication regarding latent or elementary heat
Reading the next page of Watts paper, however, undermines such a confi dent interpretation, and is to enter a world in which elements and compounds have yet to become the conceptual basis of chemistry
Instead we fi nd a world of ‘principles, ‘affi  nity and of substances uniting to varying degrees
Th us, Watt explains: It appears that dephlogisticated water, or, which may be a better name for the basis of water and air, the element you [De Luc] call humor, has a more powerful attraction for phlogiston than it has for latent heat, but that it cannot unite with it, at least not to the point of saturation, or to the total expulsion of the heat, unless it be fi rst made red-hot, or nearly so
Th e electric spark heats a portion of it red-hot, the attraction between the humor and the phlogiston takes place, and the heat which is let loose from the fi rst portion heats a second, which operates in a like manner on the adjoin- ing particles, and so continually until the whole is heated red-hot and decomposed
Th is reveals that Watt considered water and air to have a common basis
Th e language of ‘bases in this sense is like the language of ‘principles
Th ese are the elementary materials of the world
So Watt is saying that water and air share an elementary principle
He gives this the name ‘humor, a term applied in that sense by De Luc in his meteorological writings, which Watt was very familiar with
Th e fact that Watt used this concept is a key indication that he saw fundamental unities beneath the diversity of water and airs, each being a variety of the other
Th e impetus for the reaction comes from the greater affi  nity that humor has for phlogiston than it has for latent heat
Of course, for Watt heat is a chemical substance and so has an affi  nity like any other
But red heat, created by the elec- tric spark, provides the initial conditions under which the latent heat combined with a portion of the humor is converted into sensible heat
Once this occurs the humor unites with the phlogiston and the heat released initiates what we might now refer to as a chain reaction
Not everything was clear, however
Watt could not explain why the electric spark was required and why the reaction did not proceed at room temperature
He pointed to an interesting fact in this con- nection, namely that dephlogisticated air and phlogiston (infl ammable air) ‘can unite, in certain degrees without changing into water
He cited an experiment by Priestley in which clean iron fi lings and mercury calx were heated together
Whilst heated separately they would produce infl ammable air and dephlogisti- cated air respectively, when heated together they produced neither, but instead fi xed air was found
From this, and from the fact of the long-term stability of a mixture of the two airs, Priestley concluded that heating the two substances together produced the airs in a nascent state, and in that state they could com- bine to produce not water but fi xed air
So, depending on the circumstances, dephlogisticated air and infl ammable air when in proximity could remain an inert mixture, could combine to produce water or could unite to form fi xed air
Watt went further to suggest that other airs were also combinations of dephlo- gisticated air and phlogiston, phlogisticated air being a case in point
He felt he had grounds to believe that fi xed air contained a greater quantity of phlogiston than fi xed air did
It is apparent from all this, then, that Watt regarded the diff erent airs and water as all being products of the uniting of dephlogisticated air and phlogiston in diff erent degrees and by diff erent means
Th is is the key insight that is missed when Watts bald italicized statement on the composition of water is extracted and taken in isolation
At this stage in the paper Watt recalled his prior beliefs about the relations of water and air and his reasons for them
First he had believed that air was a modifi cation of water because ‘in most cases wherein air was actually made … the substances were such as were known to contain water as one of their constituent parts, yet no water was obtained in the processes except what was known to be only loosely connected with them, such as the water of crystallization of salts
Put another way, constituent water that was tightly connected disappeared dur- ing the making of air
Watt described this opinion as arising in its turn from a discovery about the latent and sensible heat of steam
He was referring here to the results of his steam experiments which he interpreted as showing that ‘the latent heat of steam was less when it was produced under a greater pressure, or in a more dense state, the value varying in such a way that ‘when a very great degree of heat was necessary for the production of the steam, the latent heat would be wholly changed into sensible heat and the steam itself might undergo a remark- able change, becoming air
Watts idea, then, was that tightly bound constituent water would require a high enough heat to release it so that all its latent heat would become sensible heat and the constituent water itself would change into air
Th e chemical signifi cance of ‘Watts law lay in this, so far as Watts early beliefs about the mechanism through which water was transformed into air
Having explained these early beliefs, however, Watt said that he had now aban- doned them because he thought that the transformation could be ‘accounted for on better principles
Th ose better principles invoked the diff erential affi  nities of substances for humor and phlogiston: In every case, wherein dephlogisticated air has been produced, substances have been employed, some of whose constituent parts have a strong attraction for phlogiston, and, as it would appear, a stronger for that substance than humor has; they should, therefore, dephlogisticate the water or fi xed air, and the humor thus set free should unite to the matter of fi re and light and become pure air
Th us Watt still has water being converted into air, but this occurs not by the action of heat alone but by a process of dephlogistication of the water to produce the intermediate humor, which then becomes pure air by uniting with fi re and light
We can now understand why Watt spends the bulk of this paper dealing with experiments in which dephlogisticated air is produced in a variety of ways – he is attempting to show that air (in this case the dephlogisticated variety) is always produced from water via humor and not from some other constituent
In par- ticular he believes that he can show that air is, as he put it in a letter to Priestley, ‘not a child of acids, by showing that the products of the various reactions con- tain as much acid as was there at the beginning
Th us Watt recounts in detail his own and others experiments with nitre, with magnesia alba, calcareous earth and minium (the red calx of lead), with mercury, sulphur and phosphorus
In all this he fi nds nothing to support, and much to deny, those views of the chemi- cal origins of dephlogisticated air that trace it to sources other than constituent water, via humor
Watts second paper, immediately following the fi rst in the Transactions, was a short one
It gave advice about precautions to be taken by anyone repeat- ing the experiments, and indicated some causes of variations in the results
Watt exhibited a typically fi rm diffi  dence about his own conclusions
Th e unavoidable little accidents which have attended these experiments, and which tend to render their results dubious have prevented me from relying on them as full proofs of the position that no acid enters into the composition of dephlogisticated air; though they give great possibility to the supposition
I have, therefore, explained the whole of the hypothesis and experiments with the diffi  dence which ought to accompany every attempt to account for the phenomena of nature on other princi- ples than those which are commonly received by philosophers in general
Watts contribution to the Philosophical Transactions, then, was not simply a bright speculative idea based only on Priestleys experimental work, but rather a sustained piece of experimental inquiry on Watts own part
Th e long sections of Watts Common Place Book77 headed ‘Dephlogisticated Air recount his own experiments in even greater detail than is recorded in the (1)(2) Th e entries begin on 3 May 1783, continuing through June and July and then resum- ing in November of that year
Priestley is a constant reference point and source of materials and ideas, but Watt remains his own man
By July 1784 the Common Place Book is taking us beyond the views expressed in Watts published papers
By then Watt was reacting to Lavoisiers interpreta- tion of those phenomena
An entry for 13 July 1784 is headed ‘Dephld Air, Mr Lavoisier from the Abbé Roziers Journal, Mai 1784, and recounts Lavoisiers ‘imitation of Priestleys experiments with the red-hot tobacco pipe
Th e imita- tion involved some variation, in that Lavoisier passed steam through a red-hot iron tube or dropped water slowly into one end of it, and then condensed any ‘steams that might pass through the red hot barrel
Watt put it thus: While the Iron is in this state the water acts upon it and separates the phlogn or Infble air, he says of the water, but more probably of the Iron, while the Depd air of the water as he supposes unites to the Iron & forms a calx such as has been described
It is more probable that the water in substance unites to the Iron & liberates its phn in ye form of Infble air which is a comp[ositio]n of phn &  [water]
Priestley later recalled the importance of Watts insistence that Lavoisier could not interpret properly these experiments passing steam through a red-hot iron tube: I should not have done this [the repetition of Lavoisiers experiment] with so much advantage, if I had not had the assistance of (1)(2) Watt, who always thought that (1)
Lavoisiers experiments by no means favoured the conclusion that he drew from them
As to myself, I was a long time of opinion that his [Lavoisiers] conclusion was just, and that the infl ammable air was really furnished by the water being decomposed in the process
But though I continued to be of this opinion for some time, the frequent repetition of the experiments, with the light which (1)(2) Watts observations threw upon them, satisfi ed me at length that the infl ammable air came from the charcoal, or the iron
Th is suggests, though it does not prove,79 that Watt was instrumental in keeping Priestley true to the phlogistian faith at this juncture, and thus maintaining him on the course of opposition for the rest of his life to Lavoisiers claims about the decomposition of water
Th e period from the mid- to the late 1780s was, of course, one in which Lavoisiers anti-phlogistic doctrine made great strides
Lavoisiers staging of the great experiment in 1785 in which water was analysed into its constituent gases that were then re-synthesized to form water, had a powerful persuasive eff ect
Lavoisier gained prominent supporters among French chemists and launched a more aggressive campaign in which his 1786 essay ‘Réfl exions sur le phlogis- tique, the Méthode de Nomenclature Chimique of 1787, and above all his
text Traité Élémentaire de Chemie played a key part
Watt was more active behind the scenes in defending phlogiston against the French, and maintaining the resolve of its opponents than his sparse public pronouncements would indicate
We have seen that Watt was never far behind Priestley, and this continued to be the case
On 11 November 1784 Watt reported to Black on a series of ‘capital Experiments by Priestley and expressed the view that ‘on the whole I think that poor Phlogiston will be perfectly saved from (1)(2)
Lavoisiers sentence of annihilation, and I think myself bound in honour to help him up with his breeches, If I have Leisure
It was to be almost two years before Watt reported to Black again about new and interesting experiments by Priestley on ‘disolving Charcoal by boiling in spirit of nitre that it produces a considerable quantity of air half of which is nitrous air and the remainder a mixture of fi xt and phlogisticated air, but most fi xt air
Watt also reported that Priestley had found some curious results by passing the ‘steams of the nitrous and vitriolic acids over metals kept red-hot in an earthen tube impervious to air
But Watt was in the doldrums himself, explaining to Black that ‘my attention to philosophical sub- jects has much abated and I try no experiments of any kind myself
Watts chemical interests probably fell temporarily victim to a bout of low spirits
His experimental interests soon revived in a diff erent, but related, con- text, that of his experiments on chlorine bleaching stimulated by his contact with Berthollet during the visit to Paris on engine business that Boulton and Watt made beginning in November 1786
Certainly by early 1788, by which time Priestley had conducted further experiments ‘which bear hard on the doctrine of the formation of water from Dephd and infble airs, Watt was showing renewed interest
Th ough he expressed some doubts about the experiments, it appeared to Watt that ‘a very large proportion of all airs even 9/10 is water, 2d that nitrous acid is a component part of Dd and infble together form it and that probably phlod air is some modifi cation of the other two
Watt betrayed some frustration at the speed of claim and counter-claim between phlogistonians and their opponents – ‘there it stands at present, but all may be changed again in a few months
But he also detected in these experiments a ‘fresh opening for the phlogistonians
Watt remained prominent among their number and was acknowledged as such
Richard Kirwan was very active during this time
He gave an account of combustion, calcination and acid formation in which phlogiston released in combustion combined with dephlogisticated air to form fi xed air, that air then combining with the residue of combustion to produce a calx or acid
As set out in An Essay on Phlogiston and the Composition of Acids (1787), this was an infl u- ential aspect of the rearguard action
We have seen above that Watt too adhered to the view that dephlogisticated air and phlogiston could and did combine in a variety of ways, not always forming water
Kirwan made use of Watts explanation of how issues of heat content aff ected the viability of chemical processes
Writ- ing about dephlogisticated and infl ammable airs, Kirwan stated: ‘both these airs may remain long together without forming any union, and when they do unite, it is because one of them has not its whole quantity of specifi c fi re; but in high degrees of heat, their specifi c becomes sensible heat, as (1)(2) Watt has discovered
Priestleys ongoing writings also show us Watt still hovering in the background
Priestleys published account of the acid substances produced on the sparking of dephlogisticated and infl ammable air incorporated letters from William With- ering and James Keir, who assisted Priestley in his analyses
It also revealed Watt monitoring everything and off ering suggestions: ‘(1)(2) Watt desires me to men- tion it as his conjecture, that the nitrous acid is contained in the infl ammable air as the acid of vitriol is in sulphur, the phosphoric in phosphorus, &c; and that the dephlogisticated air does nothing more than develop the acid
Before moving to the next phase of Watts chemical interests and devel- opment it is important to consider more generally the collaboration and relationship between Watt and (1)(2) As (1) (1) Brock has recently explained, for modern chemists and traditional historians of chemistry Priestley is a highly problematic fi gure
On the one hand he clearly deserves considerable credit for his work on the discovery of airs and is a candidate for the discovery of oxygen (along with Scheele and Lavoisier)
Yet Priestleys apparently stubborn insist- ence on defending phlogiston theory beyond the point where most others had abandoned it has, for many, tarnished his reputation
He has also been portrayed as a slap-dash and unsystematic experimentalist, surprisingly and unforgivably, ignorant of chemical fundamentals, especially the chemistry of affi  nity and salts and acids within which Lavoisier was schooled
Even Robert Schofi eld, who has done more than anyone to rescue Priestley from his sternest critics, such as (1)
(1) Partington, by resisting the worst of the Whiggish anachronistic judgements made about him, early painted Priestleys chemical career as on a downward tra- jectory from the time of his arrival in Birmingham, and thus from the time of his intimate acquaintance with (1)(2) Priestley, Schofi eld argued, was ‘on the defen- sive from that time onwards
Watt, if this is true, was hitched to a fading star
Whether or not Priestley, and therefore Watt, really was on the defensive through all or part of this period is a tricky question
To depict them as such requires a sense of the ascendency of others, and ultimately that sense can only be established retrospectively
Much historical exasperation with Priestleys work on airs stems from the assumption and feeling that he was, or ought to have been, working with a concept of ‘gases
But Priestley, like Watt, had no such conception
Although Watts belief that all airs were modifi cations of a single air, or a smaller number of airs, almost certainly predates his close association with Priestley, that association undoubtedly reinforced Watt in that view
Nei- ther man could escape the ‘lumping habit in their chemical thinking that the imperium of phlogiston and the chemical theory of latent heat imposed
Turning from these broad historiographical questions to the more immediate experimental context, many people who have followed Priestleys experimental trajectory in the 1780s have found it easy to regard Watt as a speculator depend- ent upon the chaotic and undisciplined experimentation of his friend
Priestleys experiment with the earthenware retort in which he fi rst claimed, and then retracted, the fi nding that water was being converted directly into air seems from this perspective to be a debacle
It led Watt to withdraw his letter to Priest- ley from the gaze of the Royal Society, and contributed to his loss of priority in the eyes of many
Th at loss was caused not just by delay but by the blow to Watts credibility as a chemist that many subsequent interpreters found in that event
Typical of the line of thinking that sees Watt as suff ering because he was a mere speculator is Richard Hillss remark that ‘Perhaps Watt relied too much on Priestleys experiments at this time without carrying out many himself
However, at the time that Priestleys experimental error was pointed out to him, Watt insisted that it did not destroy his theory about the nature of water
While Priestley ventured the observation that his discovery of the error ‘utterly ruined your beautiful hypothesis,89 Watt denied that that was the case: I maintain my hypothesis until it shall be shown that the water found aft er the explo- sion of pure and infl ammable air had some other origin nor shall I believe that air is a child of acids or rather a modifi cation of them untill such acids can be found aft er the decompn of it
I have many experiments to propose to you to help bring out the truth and a fair analysis of the two fl uids
Many of these experiments, as we have seen, Watt conducted himself, recorded in his Common Place Book, and published in his 1784 Philosophical Transac- tions paper
Th ey are our strongest evidence that Watt was not a mere speculator hanging from Priestleys fraying coat-tails, but rather a serious chemical thinker, not averse to devising and prosecuting his own experimental trajectory, and con- stantly learning from, and trying to make theoretical capital from, his practical projects
We should not confi ne Watts experimental experience to his activities in the laboratory
In a real sense his work devising, erecting and operating steam engines was also experimental and informed his chemical thinking
A good clue to this relates to Watts response to Priestleys experiments in early 1783 ‘turn- ing water into air
Watt explained these developments to Joseph Black: ‘water being put in a gun barrel and distilled over slowly gives no air but on being con- fi ned by a cock and lett out by puff s it produces much air, which agrees with my theory and also coincides with what I have observed in Steam Engines – In some cases I have seen the 10th of the bulk of the water of Air extricated or made from it
Watt had evidently shared these ideas with Priestley too since the latter remembered a conversation with his friend about the possibility of converting water into ‘permanent air in which Watt had observed that ‘some appearances in the working of his fi re engine had led him to expect this
How exactly does Watts theory account for the diff erence between distilling water ‘over slowly and confi ning it and letting it out by ‘puff s
While he nowhere explains this fully, the putative explanation must be something to do with the longer reten- tion of the water, which allows for more latent heat to be converted into sensible heat
We might ask also what was the analogous phenomenon that Watt saw in engines
Presumably it was the production of air from water: the last sentence of the above quotation must mean that he has seen air produced from water, either extricated or made from it, in steam engines, the resulting air being 1/10th of the bulk of the water involved
Whatever the precise explanation may be, the fact that Watt fi nds the same phenomena exhibited by Priestleys water experiments and by his steam engines reinforces my argument that Watts chemistry and his steam engine work advanced together and were mutually informative in hitherto unappreciated ways
Watts lifelong preoccupation with steam and steam engines continued to inform, and be informed by, his chemical thinking
But other prac- tical projects in the late 1780s and 1790s stimulated Watts chemical work also
It is to these that I now turn
Watts Chemistry in the late 1780s and Beyond As already noted, in mid-November 1786, Watt and his partner Matthew Boul- ton travelled together to (1)(2) Th ey had been invited to advise on improvements to the pumping station that supplied water to the Palace of Versailles, and they also hoped, vainly as it turned out, to fi nally clinch an exclusive privilege on their steam engines in (1)(2) Th ere was time and opportunity to meet many of the leading natural philosophers of the city, who gave Watt in particular a rousing reception: he described himself as being ‘drunk from morning till night with Burgundy and undeserved praise
Whilst the meetings with the likes of Lavoisier, Laplace, Monge, De Prony, Hassenfratz, Fourcroy and Delessert were exciting and tantalising given the ongoing water question, in many ways Watt most enjoyed his meetings with (1) (1) (1)(2) Th ose meetings and their cor- respondence over ensuing years were important, as historians have noted, in the development of chlorine bleaching in (1)(2)95 Berthollet described to Watt the elements of that process and advised him about it as Watt tried to implement the new technology
What has not been appreciated, however, is the extent to which chlorine bleaching, and other exchanges with Berthollet, stimulated and revi- talized Watts chemical thinking more generally
It was through Berthollet that Watt communicated his response to the new system of chemical nomenclature being proposed by the (1)(2) Although the existence of Watts response to that nomenclature has been known for some time, the extent to which it reveals his continuing adaptation but resistance to Lavoisian chemistry has not been fully appreciated
It is also likely that Watts ideas about airs were shaped in important ways by Berthollets affi  nity theory
Th is becomes apparent when we examine closely Watts thinking about airs as it is revealed in the other great practical project of this period, his collaboration with Th omas Beddoes in the devel- opment of pneumatic medicine
A careful examination of that collaboration indicates that Watt, traditionally cast in the role of the engineer who devised the apparatus to deliver the supposedly curative airs, actually brought a good deal of chemistry to the venture and continued to build his chemical ideas through it
Perhaps the most exciting event of Watts time in Paris was Berthollets dem- onstration of his method for bleaching cloth with dephlogisticated muriatic acid gas, that we call chlorine
Watt took careful notes of the process and immediately wrote an account of it to his wife Annie whose father, James McGrigor, was in the bleaching business
When Watt returned home he began experiments, which are carefully recorded in his Common Place Book, and instructed his father-in-law in trials of chlorine bleaching
Watts experiments were designed to fi nd the best method of application but also had a close eye on the economics of the process, upon which, in the end, everything would depend
By May 1787 he had a method that was ready to be scaled up
Hills comments, justly, on how impressive Watts systematic, scientifi c approach to this problem was
Th e new method of chlorine production that he devised was capable of being used successfully, and safely, by inexperienced operators
Although he had obtained permission from Berthollet to use his ideas, Watt proceeded with great caution and in secret in order not to betray too much to others who were pursuing the same objective
Even as he pursued these practical objectives Watt was still preoccupied with larger chemical questions
Indeed dephlogisticated muriatic acid air could not fail to stimulate in Watt thoughts about dephlogisticated airs in general, on which he had done so much work before, and which lay at the heart of key issues in chemistry
Probably through Berthollet and Hassenfratz, Watt became con- cerned with the new chemical nomenclature being developed in (1)(2) Th is led him to write a substantial chemical essay on the subject, fi rst discussed in detail by David (1)(2)
As the Lavoisian system gradually made converts in Britain, Watt was among those who maintained a position between the old and the new chemistry
Watts response to the new chemical nomenclature of 1787 in his unpublished essay reveals his stance
His reaction to the symbolism devised by Hassenfratz and Adet is especially revealing
Whilst accepting its general value, Watt suggested a number of changes
Many of these were pragmatic ones, aiming for greater ease of use whilst working in the laboratory
Watt discussed many of these proposed changes with Berthollet to whom the essay was sent(1) However, other suggested changes had signifi cant chemical import
Watt wanted to extend the symbol- ism to emphasize the physical states of compounds
Th is was consistent with his longstanding belief that chemical processes account for changes of state
Watt suggested changes in, or restated the meaning of, a number of the Frenchmens symbols
Th us ‘|, for Caloric, he defi ned as follows: (1)(2) Latent heat or matter of heat meaning that heat which enters into combi- nation with substances & contributes to their assuming new forms, & which is not shown by the thermometer except when a substance changes its state
Under the symbol ‘
, Watt delineated his understanding of the term ‘gas as ‘that modifi cation of matter >>>>>> not condensable by cold alone, which state seems to be produced by the union of heat & water & perhaps light with the respective bases, in some manner not yet perfectly explained
When we take this statement in conjunction with his remarks on the gas ‘oxygene (symbol ‘—), then Watts conception of air becomes clear
Watt stated that Oxygene was the basis, or base, of dephlogisticated air
Th us for Watt at this point, dephlogisticated air was oxygene in combination with heat, water and perhaps light
Th is represents a change in his thinking to the extent that he now seems to have abandoned the term and concept of ‘humor, which earlier he had adopted from De Lucs writ- ings
Now he takes ‘oxygene on board but not exactly as the Frenchmen would like
For Watt it remains a ‘basis of other things and its combination with heat and water is still chemically crucial
Watt depicted airs in like manner in his con- tributions to Th omas Beddoess publications on the medicinal uses of airs, in the mid-1790s
Th e tale of pneumatic medicine reveals another practical project in which Watt was involved, a project through which we can learn about the oth- erwise obscure changes and continuities in his thinking about airs in the 1790s
In some respects the collaboration between Th omas Beddoes and James Watt in the study, promotion and development of pneumatic medicine in the 1790s is well known
Th e main public manifestation of that collaboration was their joint publication of Considerations on the Medicinal Use and Production of Facti- tious (1)(2)102 Th e Considerations, in its very title and form, depicted the venture as a collaboration between Beddoes the medical man and Watt the engineer, Watts contribution being presented as the design of an apparatus for producing, collecting and administering airs of possible therapeutic value
Th e company of Boulton & Watt produced and sold this apparatus
However, it is also well known that Watt had compelling personal reasons for his involvement, most notably the tubercular illnesses of his daughter Janet ( Jessy) and his son (1)(2)
Jessy died before the planned Pneumatic Institute and its optimistic projectors had a chance to save her
Gregory, who died in 1804, survived long enough to know that Beddoes had abandoned hope of any major or lasting therapeutic outcome from the collaboration with his father
But there are signs that Watt retained hope in pneumatic medicine to the end of his life
Most accounts of the Watt/Beddoes collaboration have purveyed a standard story, told with variations of emphasis
Th at story has Watt driven by personal and humanitarian interest in fi nding better therapies for consumption
It por- trays him as a politically and philosophically calming infl uence upon the more radical, volatile and enthusiastic (1)(2) It concentrates on Watts construc- tion of an apparatus, his hints and cautions about its use for production of airs and their therapeutic delivery to patients
Th ere has been, however, no serious attempt to understand and interpret the ideas about airs that Watt brought to, and took from, the project
Nor have Watts ideas been compared with those of (1)(2) One reason for the lack of attention to such questions may well have been the insistence of the protagonists themselves that theory had no place in their fact-based enterprise
Th ey have been taken literally by most historians
Beddoes and Watt shared a chemical mentor – Joseph (1)(2) Beddoes stud- ied chemistry with Black whilst a medical student in Edinburgh in the early to mid-1780s, and when Beddoes began to lecture in chemistry at Oxford, his approach bore Blacks imprint
He sought Blacks advice about laboratory tech- nique, and adopted the arrangement of chemical substances wholesale from Blacks lectures
He told Black that he was equipped to demonstrate all Lavoisi- ers key experiments, and that he adopted a version of Lavoisiers chemistry in his own lectures
Th ough in many respects well-equipped, Beddoes did not man- age to mimic Blacks success as a lecturer
His main problem was a lack of skill in experimental demonstrations
In late 1787 when he moved to Oxford to lecture on chemistry Beddoes seemed prepared to reject phlogiston and therefore the idea of a class of infl am- mable bodies that had it as a common principle
However in the following year he had changed his mind again (along, it must be said, with a number of others), thanks to Priestley: ‘Dr Priestley seems totally to have overthrown the antiphlogistic theory – I am anxious to hear what the French chemists have to say on the other side – I have seen some of their private objections to Dr Priest- leys inferences, but they are totally insignifi cant
By 1791, however, Beddoes was once again convinced that Priestley and the phlogistonists were wrong
Beddoes only partially accepted the French chemistry, rejecting, for example, the notion of caloric as material heat
He had long been an adherent of the ‘new chemistry so far as the understanding of airs was concerned by the time of his collaboration with (1)(2) When, in 1793, Watt shared with Black the news of Beddoess Bristol practice he was in no doubt as to the chemical foundation of the enterprise: ‘Doctor Beddoes is applying the antiphlogistic Chemistry to Medicine, Azote & other poisonous airs to Cure Consumptions & oxigene for spasmodic asthmas he is at Bristol wells for the greater practice
Beddoes was an avowed Democrat in the years of the French Revolution and its aft ermath, and while at Oxford had published pamphlets sympathizing with the revolutionaries, and expressing hostility to French clergy who sought refuge in England; such opinions attracted the notice of the Home Offi  ce, and were unwelcome in the Tory establishment in the university
Th ereaft er Beddoes decided to pursue a medical, rather than a purely chemical, career
Watt was fi rst recruited to Beddoess pneumatic medicine project in 1794 at about the time of his daughter Jessys death from tuberculosis on 6 June that year
Richard Hillss account of the pneumatic project, which is probably based on a fuller acquaintance with the Watt correspondence than any other,112 emphasizes Watts personal grief as the chief driver of his interest and activity
Also, Hills is in little doubt that Beddoes used Watt to gain publicity and respectability
He suggests that Beddoes ‘took advantage of Watts bereavement and was quick to exploit the potential of his connections
In any case Watt quickly designed a simplifi ed apparatus for producing various airs and delivering them to patients, and drew up a description of the apparatus with instructions for its use, which was published as Part II of (1)(2) Boulton & Watt agreed to manufac- ture and sell the apparatus to Beddoes, to interested physicians and to members of the public
Between June and October 1794 Watt conducted numerous exper- iments and was in very regular correspondence with Beddoes (and a number of other physicians) about his fi ndings and about other pneumatic business such as cases of treatment
He agreed, albeit reluctantly, to some of his letters containing ‘hints on the medical use of airs also being included in the (1)(2)
Th ereaft er Watts involvement became less intense, but he continued, occa- sionally, to experiment, correspond and advise
He cooperated in the production of new parts and editions of Considerations and also assisted in raising support for the Pneumatic (1)(2)114 He reputedly installed the apparatus in the Institute when it was established in Bristol in 1797, and enjoyed cordial communications with the young assistant hired by Beddoes, one Humphry (1)(2) At the time of Gregory Watts fi nal illness in 1804, Beddoes and the establishment at Clift on still featured in Watts desperate attempts to save his son, but whether he was treated with airs is unclear
Beddoess doubts about the pneumatic project were mounting by then
Th us, Watt wrote to Beddoes in 1803: ‘You also seem to be among the sceptics in pneumatic medicine, you seem to have discarded both (1) carbonate & oxygene which have done good here
Whilst it is unclear how long Watt held out serious hopes for the enterprise, we do know that as late as 1818 he retained enough belief in pneumatic medicine to take steps to try to make it available to his former employee and friend James (1)(2) However, Lawson died before the apparatus that Watt had ordered to be sent to treat him could be supplied
In order to learn what light Watts involvement in the pneumatic project can throw on his chemical ideas, especially his understanding of airs we need to examine in some detail what he, and Beddoes, have to say in the (1)(2)
Beddoess contribution to the Considerations, Part I, was more directly con- cerned with the physiological and medical aspects of the pneumatic project
Under normal atmospheric conditions and bodily functioning, he states, ‘oxy- gene air produces just the right degree of ‘irritability in the organs and other systems of the body
Too much or too little irritability will involve a diseased state of the body
Th e taking of airs, particularly to vary the amount of ‘oxygene air taken into the blood via the lungs, is premised upon the idea of restoring just the right degree of irritability
Beddoes recounts his own, and others, experiments on animals, conducted to determine the relationship between the respiration of various airs and bodily functioning
Th e balance of Part I is devoted to cases reported to Beddoes by various practitioners
Importantly these cases are divided into four sections: fi rst those referring to the administering of ‘oxygene air; second, cases involving administration of unrespirable airs; third, cases involv- ing substances ‘that may be supposed to act chemically; fourth, ‘miscellaneous facts and refl ections
Watts hints are interposed between the second and third types of cases
Th is, we suspect, is for a very good reason, namely because Watts focus is very much upon the way in which diff erent airs deliver substances that act chemically
So his hints make the ideal transition between cases in which the focus is upon the chemical means whereby oxygenation is manipulated and those in which other chemically-acting substances are delivered to the lungs
A signifi cant diff erence between Beddoes and Watt was that Beddoess main focus was upon airs as ‘heightened or ‘lowered whereas Watt concentrated upon the other chemical eff ects
Th is squares with the state of their broader chemical allegiances
Beddoes, as a convert to Lavoisiers oxygen chemistry (though not an uncritical one) is no longer preoccupied with the mysteries of airs, especially infl ammable airs, in the way that Watt is
In his earlier publications, in which he fi rst launched his interest in pneumatic medicine, Beddoes was very ‘oxygen- centred
When Beddoes tabulated (in a 1796 publication) the cases he knew of in which factitious airs had been employed, the vast majority of treatments involved the breathing of ‘oxygene air in various dilutions
Beddoes adopted the French nomenclature and so made it clear that his plans for studying and curing diseases by breathing of diff erent airs were conceived within that system
He made the important point that most treatments would involve only small variations (from normal atmospheric composition as measured by Lavoisier) in the proportion of oxygen in the airs breathed
So it was as a convert to the Lavoisian system, and with a focus very much on oxygen, that Beddoes launched his pneumatic medicine venture
Watts preoccupations and foci were rather diff erent
As we have seen, he sought to hybridize the old and the new chemistry
He still believed in the inter- convertibility of airs
Watts preoccupation with the nature and role of charcoal is closely connected with his belief that charcoal is akin to (or to be identifi ed with) phlogiston
As we will see, at one point Watt suggests that ‘hydrogene is nothing more than charcoal ‘perfectly unifi ed with water
Watt was still puz- zling over the nature of airs in a way that Beddoes was not, and this fact made the pneumatic project, at least so far as the chemistry of airs was concerned, a more complex, frustrating, but also more open-ended and potentially instructive, one for him than it was for his collaborator
Watt contributed to the Considerations in two ways: in his account of the construction and use of the apparatus for producing airs and delivering them to the patient (Part II of Considerations), and secondly in a sequence of four letters written to Beddoes between June and October 1794 and included in the Considerations as ‘Mr Watts hints on the operation of diff erent airs
With his habitual diffi  dence, in his ‘hints Watt apologized for troubling Beddoes with his ‘crude ideas on the use of pneumatic medicines and pleaded only the desire to help others avoid the parental sorrows that he had suff ered as the reason why he had ventured ‘to step over the bounds of my profession
In ‘Apparatus Watts modesty took the form of an empirical repertoire advising that he had ‘indiff er- ently made use of the terms of the old and new Chemical Nomenclature, wishing merely to be understood, and not intending to enter into discussions upon the- ories in a treatise, the objects of which are facts
Despite Watts announced determination to stick to the facts, we fi nd numerous occasions in these works where we gain clues to the medical and chemical theories that informed Watts thinking on pneumatic airs and their uses
In some ways, Watt seemed to acknowledge airs as chemically distinct, nota- bly when he discussed dephlogisticated, or ‘oxygene, air
But there remain strong hints that he still held to the idea that diff erent airs were modifi cations of each other
Th us, in ‘Watts hints he states: ‘remedies for some fatal or dangerous dis- orders may, possibly at least, be found in the class of airs, which admit of many known modifi cations, and doubtless many more to be discovered
Th e key issue here is what Watt means when he writes about ‘modifi cations of airs
Both Part- ington and Dyck have argued that Watt was exhibiting his ongoing adherence to his earlier view that diff erent airs were the product of diff erent combinations of heat with common air; that dephlogisticated, fi xed and infl ammable airs were in eff ect chemical varieties of the one air
Th e diff erence between modifi ca- tions of air and diff erent species of air is important; even Priestley, the foremost pneumatic chemist of the day, was concerned with modifi cations of air, blurring the lines between species and varieties
Something like that view holds most clearly in Watts account of ‘infl am- mable or hydrogene airs
He distinguished these airs according to the mode of production
Infl ammable air produced from zinc he described as the ‘purest, or at least the lightest species of this air, whilst that produced from iron ‘is the next in specifi c gravity to the infl ammable air from zinc
From charcoal, water and heat, ‘heavy infl ammable air is produced, also called by Watt ‘carbonated Hydrogene, or Hydro-Carbonate
Watt, however, also appears to have had other phenomena in mind when he wrote of ‘modifi cations of airs
Both the practical production of airs and Watts therapeutic hopes for them involved him in interesting ideas about the airs and the metals, or other substances, from which they are produced
Th ese ideas were presented as a response to suggestions by ‘some eminent physicians that pow- dered substances, such as Peruvian bark and the calces of lead and zinc, might have therapeutic value in treating conditions of the lungs: To the use of powders, however fi nely mechanically divided, I think there are some objections; particularly I doubt whether they could enter the minute vesicles of the lungs, but if such substances can be chemically divided and obtained in the state of solution in air of some congenial species, they might have their full eff ect
Th is idea of ‘chemical division seems to imply an association between an air and a substance that is intermediate between mechanically separable and chemi- cally compounded
Th e idea appears repeatedly in both ‘Watts hints and in ‘Apparatus, but is not expressed consistently
On occasion Watt uses the term ‘suspension to refer to it
For example, infl ammable air produced from iron and vitriolic acid, he states ‘always carries with it, even through water, a large quantity of iron; some of which it aft erwards deposits, but very probably some part still remains suspended
Th e part of the carried-over iron that remains suspended must have a diff erent relationship with the air than that which is deposited
Th at relationship is (from a modern perspective) an intermediate one between mechanical mix and chemical compound
For Watt this was simply a diff erent form of compounding
Elsewhere Watt expressed this idea diff erently
Th us when referring to zincic infl ammable air he distinguished between the suspen- sion and the solution of fl owers of zinc in the air: Th is air carries with it a large quantity of the fl owers of zinc in suspension, which it deposits by standing at rest; it probably also contains another quantity in a state of solution, which seems to form a part of its substance, and on which some of its virtues may depend
Th e description of the zinc forming part of the ‘substance of the air by virtue of being dissolved in it is a revealing idea
It implies that there is no clear distinction to be made between solutions and chemical compounds – that chemical union admits of degrees of intimacy
Watts account of heavy infl ammable air reinforced this notion
Th is air is produced, he says, by applying water to red-hot charcoal in closed vessels
It con- tains ‘infl ammable air, properly so called, fi xed air, separable by water or by alkalis, and some other substance, which, when the infl ammable air is defl agrated with oxygene air, produces fi xed air
Th is substance I consider as charcoal in a state of solution
Watt took the fact that this ‘charcoal in a state of solution could not be removed in the same way as the fi xed air (by passing it through water or alkali) as evidence that it was not ‘fi xed air completely formed
And since he regarded fi xed air as a saturated solution of charcoal in ‘oxygene air, the implication was that the ‘charcoal in a state of solution is an unsaturated solution
In these ways charcoal was present in large quantities in heavy infl ammable air
In fact, Watt said, ‘no substance is dissolved in infl ammable air in such quantities as charcoal, nor more intimately united
So, when Watt wrote about charcoal, or other substances, being dissolved in airs he was describing what he considered to be a process of chemical union that could exhibit degrees of intimacy
Th is idea was very important to Watts estimate of therapeutic possibili- ties
Th e anticipated effi  cacy of heavy infl ammable air, and his special interest in it, was based in Watts thinking on the amount of charcoal that it contained
Given the value of charcoal itself in ‘correcting putridity, an air containing it should exhibit similar eff ects upon the body
However, in the case of treating consumption with airs, not just any old state of charcoal would do, according to (1)(2) Th e charcoal had to enter the bloodstream
Watt considered this unlikely to occur in the case of fi xed air (a saturated solution of charcoal in ‘oxygene air) because the lungs would not be able to decompose it
But the ‘other sub- stance in heavy infl ammable air that was an unsaturated solution of charcoal was more promising: ‘Whether charcoal in this state could be decomposed by any excess of oxygene in the blood of consumptive patients, I cannot say; but it seems likely that it would, and at any rate it would act as charcoal powder does, and therefore highly merits trial
Overall it appears that Watts chemistry of airs, as he mobilized it in the mid-1790s was still grounded in his early ideas of the interconvertibility of airs as modifi ed by the subsequent debates on phlogiston theory, but that new ideas about airs as solutions had also been added
It is worth considering where those new ideas might have come from
Watts views on degrees of intimacy of chemical union and on processes of solution as creating compounds are reminiscent of ideas expressed by Claude- Louis Berthollet in his major works on affi  nity
At fi rst sight, however, the idea that Watt derived these concepts from Berthollet seems implausible because the Frenchmans major publications on the subject did not appear until the early nineteenth century
Th e possibility remains, however, because Berthollets ideas on solution and indefi nite proportions were present, albeit in unsystematic form, in his earlier publications, including his writings on bleaching and dyeing, with which, as we have seen, Watt was very familiar
Th e intensive interac- tions between Watt and Berthollet make it very likely that the Frenchmans ideas on affi  nities and degrees of intimacy of chemical union, as expressed in his published papers and in his book on dyeing, were known to Watt who then deployed similar notions in thinking about airs when he turned to the pneumatic project
When Lavoisier in 1789 touched on affi  nities as the transcendental part of chemistry, he tipped his hat to Berthollet, whose researches in this fi eld were already underway
Once we realize that Watt was working with this concept of degrees of inti- macy of union, his ideas about the relative therapeutic value of airs become clearer
One clear statement of this is made in a letter that Watt intended to send to Dr Th omas Percival in November 1794
Writing of fi xed air, Watt stated that it ‘not only acts by exclusion of the oxygene, but also acts upon the nerves & upon the blood and that fi xed air thus has ‘positive powers
His guess from Priestleys experiments was that the fi xed air would ‘carbonize the blood
By contrast, infl ammable air (meaning here light infl ammable air or ‘hydrogene) ‘seems to act principally [sic] by the exclusion of oxygene, unless when mixed with some other substance, such as those which give it smell, or the Iron or Zinc it contains
Hydro carbonate, produced by the action of charcoal on steam, like fi xed air, produced by the action of charcoal on ‘oxygene, ‘seems either to be rap- idly absorbed by the blood or to act powerfully on the nerves
Hydro carbonate ‘seems to be the essence of fi xt air
Whilst Watt acknowledged those aspects of pneumatic medicine that involved the administration of excess oxygen or its reduction by processes of exclusion, he was particularly interested in what he called the ‘positive powers of airs that deliv- ered substances to the blood and acted upon it
Th e ability to deliver depended upon how close the union of the substance in the air was
Th ere appears to have been a hierarchy of eff ectiveness
Light infl ammable air or ‘hydrogene air was the least eff ective in this regard because it consisted of ‘the most perfect union of charcoal with water
Perhaps the perfection of this union meant that the charcoal could not be given up to the blood whereas in the case of less perfect unions of charcoal in fi xed air and hydro carbonate it could be so given up
Th is appears to be what Watt was trying to say to Beddoes in a letter of March 1795: I have formed an opinion, that, Oxygene & Hydrocarbonate are the only airs neces- sary to be employed
I think that the effi  cacy of Hydrogen (so called) depends intirely upon the Hydro carbonate it contains & that in fact it [the referent here is ‘hydrogen proper] may turn out to be nothing else than a more perfect union of charcoal with water… As to oxygen I am of opinion that in all ill conditioned ulcers, cancers not excepted that the breathing it will prove useful
An even fuller understanding of Watts perspective on pneumatic medicine and the chemistry of airs can be gained by examining his correspondence with Bed- does and others at the height of his activity
Th e Considerations was fi rst published in October 1794, some four months aft er Jessys death on 6 (1)(2) In the interven- ing period, Watt (signifi cantly aided by his younger son, Gregory) had engaged in a fevered bout of experimentation
Stimulated by the need to bury his grief in activity, and prompted by the hope of saving others from the fate of his daughter, Watt tackled many aspects of the production and medical use of airs during this period
Th is initial burst of activity was quite brief, and ended as rapidly as it began
Writing to Beddoes on 25 October, Watt observed: ‘Gregory went off  last night, & my laboratory is full of potatoes, so no more airs just now
Although Watt did have some early involvement in the actual treatment of patients he found this uncomfortable and opted for self-experimentation
Watt dosed himself and reported the eff ects
On one occasion Gregory smelt an air and woke up prostrate staring at the ceiling
Watt and Gregory did most of their work on experiments that allowed Watt to provide hints to Beddoes and others about how best to produce diff erent kinds of airs
While some products car- ried over with airs might be therapeutic, others, such as acids, could do damage and had to be removed
Watt also did much work on removing the smells of air, this not only to make them more palatable in treatment, but also to investigate whether the nausea induced by smell was the causal agent in any curative eff ect, or not
Beyond all this, though, Watt saw these experiments as part of an inves- tigation into the nature of airs
His correspondence on medical and production aspects oft en switches to consideration of the chemistry of airs per se
Despite his disclaimer in the Considerations that in this work he was neutral between old and new chemical systems and was just off ering facts, the facts that Watt pro- duced he saw and valued precisely as they threw light on the phlogiston issue
Describing to Darwin the apparatus that he had developed, and how it would be used, Watt reminded his friend ‘I am still a sceptic as to the antiphlogistic theory in general though I believe some part of it
Writing to another corre- spondent a few months later, outlining his approach to pneumatic medicine and the facts on which his views were based, Watt explained his habitual use of the term ‘infl ammable air rather than ‘hydrogene: ‘I dislike the word Hydrogene as possibly not founded in fact
In these little ways Watt reminded his cor- respondents that his approach to pneumatic medicine was, for all his vaunted even-handedness about facts in public, based on a theoretical position at odds with the new chemistry
Th e clearest evidence for Watts theoretical views on airs at this time, but in a frustratingly fragmented form, comes in correspondence with Beddoes just as they were fi nalizing the proofs of (1)(2) In a letter of 3 September Watt mentioned that he had enclosed a ‘2d memoir upon airs
Th is memoir has not been located, but Watts previous letter to Beddoes (itself imperfectly preserved) contains a disquisition on airs that may well have been a fi rst memoir
Th e status of these memoirs is unclear, but they seem to have been separate from the mate- rial that Watt contributed to the (1)(2) Th at material was referred to in correspondence as the ‘description of the apparatus or as ‘hints on airs, not as a memoir or memoirs
Perhaps the memoirs were contemplated for inclusion in the Considerations, although their explicitly controversial character would have been completely out of tune with the rhetorical stance otherwise adopted in that pub- lication
Maybe Watt was considering publishing them elsewhere
Whatever the case, the fragment of what is probably the fi rst memoir on airs refers to ‘another proof that no air can be made without water & that it forms the principal part of its gravitating matter, and continues, ‘Airs, then, consist of water or steam united to some other substances, all in themselves unknown, except charcoal
A few days later Watt added another comment that clarifi es his point: My opinion I have hinted before that water in specie forms the greater part of all airs, & I think the heavy infl ammable air should be named Hydro carbonate for if it can be produced in so small a mixture as 1/12 of fi xt air as Dr Priestley affi  rms what becomes of the oxygen if the water is supposed to be decomposed[
]
Hydrocarbonate is so important to Watt because it is the archetypical air pro- duced by dripping water onto red-hot charcoal
If the water was decomposed in the process then one would expect a signifi cant proportion of fi xed air to be produced
Since this was not always the case, the water must not be decomposed but rather enter into airs in specie, that is, in the actual form of water
Watt here is making it clear that he is aligned with Priestley in fi ghting what Darwin, Beddoes and many other British chemists by this time regarded as a rearguard action against the ‘new chemistry
Watt and Priestley had, as we have seen, long worked closely together and, although their relationship was not so close in the 1790s, they continued to refer to each others work to bolster their position
Aft er his departure from Birmingham aft er rioters attacked and burned his house, Priestley resumed work in London and from there in 1793 published Experiments on the Generation of Air fr om (1)(2) In this he reprinted a Philo- sophical Transactions paper in which he argued that it was probable ‘that water, as I have lately advanced, is only the basis of those kinds of air [dephlogisticated and infl ammable] as well as of every other
Th is work was dedicated to the members of the Lunar Society and anticipated Priestleys imminent departure for the United (1)(2) Th ere, as is well known, Priestley continued to write in support of the phlogiston theory
He also took an interest in Watts work on medicinal airs, while Watt sent him an apparatus
In Th e Doctrine of Phlogiston Established, Priestley noted that his experiment showing that the slow passage of steam over red-hot charcoal produced nothing but infl ammable air had been ‘confi rmed by (1)(2) Watt, whose accuracy no person will call in question: He [Watt] says in his Description of a pneumatical apparatus, subjoined to Dr Bed- doess Considerations on the medicinal use of factitious air, p(1) ‘It has been observed by (1)(2) Priestley, and confi rmed by my experience, that when much water passes in the form of steam, there is much fi xed air formed; but little or none when the water is admitted so sparingly that no steam reaches the refrigeratory
Priestley, if not Watt, was happy to implicate Watts contribution to the Con- siderations, publicly as well as privately, in a rearguard defence of phlogiston theory
For Watt, as we have seen, the theoretical background to his understanding of airs, and to his hopes for their successful therapeutic use, was more complex
Whilst he saw some virtues in the new chemistry, he remained a phlogistian
His theoretical refl exes in the 1790s still harked back to ideas formed early in his chemical investigations about the inter-convertibility of diff erent airs
Th e puzzle for Watt was still very much framed as about fi nding out what it was that accounted for interconversions
But despite these deep continuities in his thought, Watt drew (in magpie-like fashion) on other chemical ideas
It appears that Watt adopted ideas about solutions and degrees of chemical union from Berthollet as a result of their exchanges about bleaching and dyeing, which he then deployed in his thinking about airs in the 1790s
As Dyck pointed out, Watts distinctive chemical explanation in his work on  the composition of water was lost during the assimilation of Blacks doctrines  to the new Lavoisian system in the 1780s and 1790s
Watt had pursued some  of the explanatory possibilities that Blacks ideas off ered for conceptualizing  chemical change in terms of latent heat in a way that the great teacher himself  had not
Once Blacks ideas were subsumed into another system, Watts work  would come to seem idiosyncratic
Even by the late 1780s and 1790s this proc- ess was underway, with Black contributing to the process himself in his lectures  by his incorporation of Lavoisian ideas
Occasionally something of the Scottish  tradition in its unassimilated form could be seen, Robisons articles in the third  edition (1797) of the Encyclopaedia Britannica being a prime example
My point about Watts chemistry, then, is a simple but little-heeded one
To understand its character and substance we need to assess the way that Watt  drew upon a series of collaborative relationships, a number of them connected  directly with practical ventures
First, we should look to his involvement with  the Black tradition and the resources available to him from predecessors such as  Boerhaave, Cullen, Eller and the like
From these resources, and from his own  experimental work on the properties of steam (in the laboratory and, it must  not be forgotten, in the large through the actual construction and operation  of engines), Watt developed ideas about water and steam in which they were  compounded with heat
Th is re-contextualization of Watts chemistry makes it  clear that throughout his active work on the steam engine, and consistent with his larger chemical views, for Watt steam was a compound of water and latent  heat
Watt found support for his ideas in the meteorology of De Luc and in his  chemical collaboration with (1)(2) Th at collaboration was based in part on  Watts predilection for the theoretical interpretation of the experiments of oth- ers, but this does not mean that Watt was entirely dependent on Priestley for  experimental fodder, as many accounts have assumed
Watt conducted numer- ous experiments of his own, especially on dephlogisticated air
Th ese, together  with his earlier steam experiments (to which he continually returned with a view  to refi ning and extending them) gave him an independent experimental base  from which to develop and maintain his chemical ideas about water, steam and  airs
Once we realize this then Watt is no longer quite the victim to the experi- mental failures of Priestley that he is usually portrayed as
Watts publications in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society  in 1784 were important in themselves, and also because they opened a wider  world of chemical contacts to him
His visit to Paris in 1786 brought him within  the ambit of a number of important French chemists
Th ese included Lavoisier  himself, but arguably the most important of them from Watts perspective was  (1)(2) For it was Berthollet who not only confi ded his methods of chlorine  bleaching but also discussed with Watt, in their correspondence, larger questions  of chemical nomenclature and process
Th e accumulated knowledge and technique thus acquired from his multiple  collaborations and his own extensive experimental work were brought to bear on  his fi nal major collaboration, with Beddoes on the pneumatic medicine project
I have argued that in this project, too, Watts work – usually seen as the prac- tical contribution of an engineer – was in fact both chemically informed and  chemically signifi cant
Watt certainly hoped for medical benefi ts from the ven- ture but his chemical curiosity was also piqued
His emphasis on the potential  medical value of hydrocarbonate was a result of his theoretical reasoning about  the nature and mode of action of that ‘air
Th ree chemical components – the  chemical theory of heat, ‘oxygene theory reconciled to the continued impor- tance of phlogiston, and an affi  nity theory which allowed for the combination of  substances in varying degrees – all entered into that reasoning
Insofar as treat- ments were found to work – and there were many hopeful signs – the pneumatic  project provided further justifi cation for the value of the assembly of chemical  understandings that Watt brought to it
Th at Watts chemical understandings were later to represent a crime against  progress for characters such as William Whewell, or an embarrassing archaicism  for Watts nineteenth-century supporters in the water controversy, should not  be allowed to obscure them for us now
Getting Watts chemistry in focus makes  clearer its thematic importance to virtually all his practical ventures, including  his steam engine innovations
It is to that specifi c connection that I now turn in the fi nal two chapters
– 125 – 5 THE STEAM ENGINE AS CHEMISTRY Th ere are two ways in which the centrality of the chemistry of heat, water and steam to Watts steam engine improvements can be discerned
One, which will be pursued later in this chapter, is to reconstruct in a technical sense – building on what we now know about Watts chemistry – the conceptual world in which, and through which, Watts thinking about the steam engine took place
A second is to gain an appreciation of what we might call the ‘ecology of steam
By this I mean the broader chemical cosmology, embracing meteorology and geology, of which steam and the steam engine were a part, for Watt and his contemporaries
I start with the wider chemical picture
Th e Ecology of Steam: Meteorology, Geology and Th e Botanic Garden Newcomen engines are known as ‘atmospheric engines
Th is is because the drive on the piston is provided by the atmosphere working against the partial vacuum created in the cylinder by the condensation of the steam
But there was, and is, a deeper sense in which steam engines were atmospheric engines even when Watt put the steam itself to work in driving the piston
Th e engines were seen as trading on processes that were ubiquitous in the natural world and respon- sible for other atmospheric and geological phenomena
Meteorological and geological understandings were thus important to the science of heat and steam that underpinned the steam engine
Th ose who thought about steam and the steam engine sought, and found, coherences between phenomena in the realm of engines, meteorology and geology
Indeed, I suggest that a steam engine was sometimes thought of as a kind of local corralling of the wild forces of nature
In the twentieth century nuclear physicists sometimes spoke about the act of deploying nuclear forces to provide energy via nuclear reactors as ‘twisting the tail of the dragon
I believe that the same sense of domesticating a wild phenom- enon attended eighteenth-century steam engine technology
Th e steam engine in the eighteenth-century landscape was, not just aesthetically, but also ecologi- cally, part of what went on around it
Watt and De Luc Watt had a longstanding relationship with the Swiss meteorologist Jean André De (1)(2) By the time De Luc began his extended residence in England as Reader to Queen Caroline in 1775 Watt was already familiar with his work, having reported to William Small in 1773 that he had ‘been reading De Luc lately, and I have tried a curious experiment to determine the heats at which water boils at every inch of mercury from vacuo to air
De Lucs observations and mine agree; but his rule is false
Th e point to note here is that De Lucs writings on the atmosphere (in this case his Recherches sur les Modifi cations de lAtmosphere published in 1772) appear to have inspired Watt to conduct particular chemical experiments
More- over, although these experiments were most immediately connected with Watts eff orts to construct barometers, they were also part of his attempts to develop a deeper understanding of the steam engine
Th us, immediately aft er reporting on the repetition of the De Luc experiment, Watt advised: I have some thoughts of writing a book, the ‘Elements of the Th eory of Steam-engines, in which, however, I shall only give the enunciation of the perfect engine
Th is book might do me and the scheme good
And would still leave the world in the dark as to the true construction of the engine
Something of this kind is necessary, as Smeaton is labouring hard at the subject; and if I can make no profi t, I ought not to lose the honour of my experiments
It seems clear from the way that Watt juxtaposed his reading of, and views about, De Luc that he conceived a close relationship between De Lucs chemical mete- orology and his own experiments on steam
Certainly he was to fi nd fault with some of De Lucs ideas and was cautious about ensuring that De Luc did not overlook the credit due to Watts friend and mentor Joseph Black in the dis- covery of ‘latent heat
However, their meteorological and steam engine interests were about atmospheres in a way that was mutually informative
It seems that in 1773 De Lucs writings were one of the factors that turned Watt to the thought of developing and writing his theory of steam-engines
By the time De Luc published his Idées sur la Météorologie in 1787, Watt was not only familiar with the ideas expressed there but had learned about many of them fi rsthand and prior to publication
Watts experiments in the early 1780s, which were so important to his ideas on both steam and the composi- tion of water, were developed in concert with De Lucs work
In fact, when Watt wrote the famous letters to Matthew Boulton and to Joseph Black (discussed in Chapter 4), in which he announced his ideas about the composition of water he had been working directly with De Luc in the laboratory on steam, heat and evaporation
As we have seen, Watts paper on the composition of water in the Philosophical Transactions in 1784 took the form of a letter to De Luc, and, of course, De Luc was the one who urged Watt to assert his rights in the contro- versy with (1)(2)
De Luc was in Birmingham in October 1782 and visited Soho in the com- pany of Baron (1)(2)7 Watt showed the visitors around and was impressed by De Luc as ‘a modest ingeneous man
Th is was probably their fi rst meeting
It was either on that occasion or on a return visit on 9 November that De Luc told Watt about his plans to write ‘some thing on heat and on the nature of elastic fl uids
Watt reported that during the November visit De Luc came for breakfast and ‘spent the whole forenoon incensing himself with steam & steam Engines
De Luc was anxious to learn about Watts experiments, and Watt was forthcoming to some extent
Th e diffi  culty was that he could not explain his own work with- out referring to Blacks on latent heat and he wanted to obtain the professors permission before he gave too much information to De (1)(2)10 It was at this junc- ture that Watt conveyed his idea about the composition of water to Matthew (1)(2) Th is, it will be recalled, involved the idea that water was converted into air if heated enough
For Watt this also had meteorological import – ‘here is a plain account of where atmospheric air comes from, he suggested to (1)(2)
Aft er the late 1782 visit, De Luc was due to return to Birmingham, and it appears that he did return in March 1783, staying with (1)(2)12 According to Watt, during that visit he and De Luc were ‘principally employed in experiments of the latent heat in vacuo, but from the many causes of inaccuracy could come to no other conclusion than that at least the sum of the latent or sensible heat is always equal, that is that the latent heat encreases [sic] as the sensible heat decreases and in some experiments the sum of the heats appeared to be greater in Vacuo than in the Air
De Luc was at Watts house again in late September
conducting further experiments
So Watts engine work and De Lucs meteorology certainly had plenty of opportunity to intersect
In fact, substantially similar chemical ideas were deployed in each domain
Th is intersection is apparent retrospectively in De Lucs Idées sur la Météorologie
A centrepiece of the Idées was De Lucs critique of the solution theory of evaporation as put forward by Senebier, Franklin, Hut- ton and others
According to that theory, water vapour was produced – that is, evaporation occurred – by the dissolution of water in air in a way precisely analogous to the dissolution of salt in water
Th is theory faced the diffi  culty that evaporation occurred in vacuo
De Lucs alternative theory was that water vapour was in fact a chemical product of water and heat
In recounting how he became confi dent of that alternative theory De Luc gave a prominent place to Watts steam experiments
In the Idées De Luc noted how Watt applied and extended the ideas of Joseph Black on latent heat
Watt applied them to the steam engine ‘where the vapours of boiling water played such a large part
Watt had ‘already surmised that these machines were very far from producing the amount of eff ect of which their cause was capable and, De Luc stated, ‘he [Watt] attributed that defi ciency to lack of knowledge about the nature of the active agent
De Luc also recalled how Watt kindly repeated his experiments for him [De Luc], and the Swiss reported in detail those of Watts experiments ‘which helped me most directly to demon- strate that the latent heat of vapours cannot be explained except by a chemical union of particles of fi re and those of water
So De Luc stated that Watts steam experiments provided him with the key evidence for the central proposition of his meteorological work
In tracing connections between steam engines and meteorology, it is also worth noting that De Luc, who was perhaps overly fond of analogies, invoked images of boilers in his discussions of clouds
Having argued that the appearance and disappearance of clouds was independent of the hydroscopic state of the air (and therefore not just a matter of solution and precipitation), De Luc went on: Observing these metamorphoses of one and the same cloud, nothing represents them more exactly for me than the idea of an invisible boiler suspended in the air, with water boiling violently in it
Th is image is too perfect a symbol of what is then observed for there not to be some analogy in the causes; that is to say, some metamor- phosis of substance
Ultimately, De Lucs great ‘discovery was that evaporated water, which, if it accu- mulated in long periods of fi ne weather could not possibly all conceal itself in the upper atmosphere, ‘hides itself in the atmosphere under the appearance of some gaseous fl uid [fl uide aëriforme]; for this is the only way in which it can escape its pressure, growing upon it as it accumulates, and the great diff erences of tem- perature to which it is subjected
Having thus been hidden, the gaseous fl uid is on occasion converted back into its watery form as vapour, becoming once again available to form clouds and rain
Th us the interconversion of air and water was the basis of De Lucs theory of rain and that interconversion itself depended upon the composition and decomposition of water particles and fi re particles
Th e interconversion of air and water gained credibility when De Luc learned of the formation of water by the sparking of infl ammable air in dephlogisticated air
De Luc recalled: ‘the idea of water in any aërial form whatever was to me what a meeting of sea birds would be to sailors who have lost their compass and are searching blindly for the shore
We must remember that many regarded the various airs that had recently been discovered as diff erent varieties of the one, common, air, so that any gaseous product of water would be regarded as ‘air and would establish the interconvertibility of the two
We have already seen
that Watt used De Lucs concept of ‘humor in his 1784 Philosophical Transac- tions paper on the nature of water
Th at concept too underscored the idea that water and air were extremes on a chemical spectrum
Both Watt and De Luc were eager to deal with the various ‘forms of water, including air, as variants upon the ‘humor principle
Even more exciting, for both De Luc and for Watt, at least initially, was Priest- leys announcement in 1783 of his conversion of water into air in an earthenware retort merely by heating
We have seen that this encouraged Watt to put forward his long-gestating theory of the composition of water, and confi rmed De Luc in his theory of water vapour and rain
When Priestley subsequently reported that his experiment had been in error, both Watt and De Luc denied that this reversal put their theories in danger
Watt had merely denied that it demolished his theory
De Luc refused to believe Priestleys retraction
Once again it must be recalled that Watt and De Luc were working very closely at this point, the one concerned primarily with his water and steam-engine work, the other with his meteorology
Just how closely Watt and De Luc converged in treating steam engines and meteorological processes as physically related remains unclear
Th eodore Feldman, having examined their work and found it conceptu- ally related up to a point, concluded, however, that ‘Watt was experimenting with and for steam engines
He did not put his work in a meteorological context
Feldman argues that Watt in fact believed in the solution theory of evaporation so far as evaporation at normal temperatures was concerned
But Feldman grounds this claim on views apparently consistent with the solution theory of evaporation that Watt expressed in letters written in 1779 and 1780
Th ese letters were writ- ten before Watts personal encounters with De Luc, which clearly much impressed him
In late 1783 Watt wrote to Gilbert Hamilton: Mr De Luc is here now, he is busy writing a dissertation on spontaneous evaporation, which he contends is not caused by a solution in air but by Latent heat, in the same manner as vapour is produced by boiling water
I am giving him all the assistance in this subject I can, and he makes frequent and honourable mention of me in the work which is of consequence as it is to be published at (1)(2)
Although divining Watts meaning here is diffi  cult in some respects,22 this passage does suggest that he was not confi dent enough, or eager, to fl atly reject De Lucs account of evaporation, at least in late 1783
It is possible, indeed, that at that time Watt agreed with De (1)(2) At the very least he was not worried about having his name and reputation associated with De Lucs ideas or about being seen as his collaborator
He was clearly fl attered by it, and enjoying the prospect
It may well be that at this point he was prepared to accept De Lucs intended extension of the imperium of the chemistry of latent heat
What is certain is that for both of them a chemical theory of heat held the key
De Luc affi  rmed the chemical nature of meteorology when he envisaged the atmosphere as ‘a chemical labora- tory, as important as the bowels of the earth for the physical phenomena of our globe
Mention of the ‘bowels of the earth points us to another aspect of the ‘cosmology underwritten by the chemistry of heat that framed Watts work
Watt, Hutton and ‘Geology It is worth considering briefl y the role of the chemistry of heat in the develop- ment of geology during this same period, especially its role in the geology of Watts friend James (1)(2) Here too the steam engine and geological processes were analogically and conceptually interlinked in revealing ways
Also, as we saw in Chapter 4, it has been shown by Patsy Gerstner and Arthur Donovan that Huttons ideas were subsequently ‘cleaned up by his followers in order to make them more acceptable in the rapidly changing natural philosophical landscape of the early nineteenth century
My claim is analogous: that a very similar thing happened to James Watts ideas about steam and the steam engine in a way that eff ectively disguised their origins in the chemistry of steam
Huttons theory of heat was very important to his theory of the Earth but was given little prominence in the accounts of Huttons theory developed by his followers, notably John Playfair and Sir James Hall,24 who reinterpreted and reshaped it
For them the chemical theory of heat was an excisable irrelevance, a diversion from the centrally important features of Huttons theory of the (1)(2)
Hutton used the ideas of latent and specifi c heats, which were respectively the principles of fl uidity and volume, as parts of the ‘repulsive force or what he called the ‘solar substance
Together with light and electricity, specifi c heat and volume made up the repulsive force
Hutton explained the dynamics of natural cycles of rock formations largely in these terms within his theory, and so Hut- tons theory of the Earth was given its dynamics by the chemical theory of heat
We have seen how De Luc pursued analogies between meteorological proc- esses and those in the steam engine, and we will see below that Erasmus Darwin did the same in various of his writings
Hutton was also inclined to these analog- ical transpositions with regard to his theory of the (1)(2) A number of historians of geology have observed that Hutton was much impressed by the new steam engines which, with their complex, large-scale movements driven by a single source of heat, may well have been one of the inspirations for his theory of a heat-driven earth machine
If this was the case then the steam engine was eff ec- tively treated as a microcosm of the earth-machine
Th ese ideas were certainly prevalent in more popular accounts of the steam engine in the late eighteenth and very early nineteenth centuries
Th us the entry in Public Characters for Mat- thew Boulton, when giving an account of the steam engine, states: ‘Th us we “put a hook in the nose of the leviathan”; thus we “play with him as a child and take him as a servant for ever”; thus “we subdue nature, and derive aid and comfort from the elements of earthquakes”
When we trace the relations of Hutton and Watt we fi nd that they had a close association for many years
When they met is unclear, but it was sometime before 1772 and probably through their mutual friend, and common chemi- cal mentor, Joseph (1)(2)28 Th ere were plans at one stage for the three of them to travel together on the occasion of Watts historic removal to Birmingham in 1774, but in the event only Hutton left  with Watt on 17 May that year
Th ey arrived in Birmingham on 31 (1)(2) Watt and Hutton visited the Cheshire salt mines either during that journey or shortly aft er their arrival in Birmingham and in those mines Hutton made observations later to be important in his Th eory of the (1)(2)29 It seems possible that this period of close association and work together cemented what was to be a long, if physically distant, friendship
Th eir subsequent surviving correspondence is scanty but intimate
In his more regu- lar correspondence with Black, Watt constantly referred to, inquired aft er, and asked to be remembered to, his friend (1)(2) (1)(2)
In Birmingham and its environs Hutton met other members of the Lunar Society, including Matthew Boulton and Erasmus (1)(2) On a visit to the latter in Lichfi eld, Hutton used Darwins house as a base for expeditions into Derbyshire and also participated in an experiment with an airgun and thermom- eter to demonstrate how the expansion of air cools it
Darwin was later to make use of this fact in explaining processes of ‘devaporation in clouds and in steam engines, as we will see in a moment
At the time of their journey together Hutton and Watt must have discussed pretty thoroughly their respective preoccupations
We know from Watts corre- spondence, as already noted, that he had recently been conducting experiments on the boiling of water at various pressures, partly inspired by De Lucs work
Given that Hutton was already preoccupied with the role of fi re in the formation of the rocks of the Earth, and the behaviour of materials, including aeriform fl u- ids, at high pressures, it seems likely that the similarities between their respective inquiries would have been discussed
Hutton was to rely on ideas about the way in which extreme heat and high pressure brought about departures from normal chemical action
For example, he explained the non-caustic character of calcare- ous earths – a property urged by some as evidence against Huttons theory of heat as the primary agent – by the fact that high pressure had prevented heat from driving out the fi xed air as it did under normal laboratory conditions
Watt, as we have seen, developed the idea that extreme heat would convert water into air, not just into vapour
A number of historians of geology have been persuaded that Huttons expo- sure to Watts steam engines probably provided Hutton with the idea of the Earth as a machine, which is a recurrent analogy in his theory of the (1)(2) Playfairs biography of Hutton noted the admiration that he expressed for Watts engine,
and this observation has since been supported by other writers
Gordon Davies speculated that Hutton may have witnessed Watts fi rst full-scale experiments with the steam engine in 1769 at Kinneil House, the home of Watts fi rst patron John Roebuck, which was not far from (1)(2) We know that Hutton vis- ited Kinneil because he refers in the Th eory to a bed of oyster shells seen there
Th is observation could have been at the same time as he witnessed Watts experi- ments
It is even more likely that Hutton saw the Kinneil engine when it was re-erected in Birmingham for his fellow traveller Watt in 1774
Huttons ‘Earth-machine might in theory have been inspired by any of the machines of the Industrial Revolution, but it is surely no coincidence that he regarded the Earth as a kind of heat engine, which brings the analogy closer
Whether the analogy was even closer still depends on whether Hutton can be reasonably attributed with the idea that the burning of coal was the source of the Earths subterranean heat – an issue that divides historians of geology
But even if coal was not the fuel of the heat machine, the analogy remains strong
As Gordon Davies notes, ‘the active agents in Watts engine and the Huttonian theory are identical – fi re and water: Hutton himself observed that his theory is ‘a system in which the subterranean power of fi re, or heat, co-operates with the action of water upon the surface of the Earth…
He perhaps saw the elevation of new continents by subterranean heat, and the lower- ing of the older continents by atmospheric agencies, as in some way analogous to the rise and fall of the piston in one of Watts early single-acting pumping engines
If De Luc liked to think of steam boilers in the clouds, perhaps Hutton had pis- tons deep within the Earth
As Davies also notes, the Earth/heat-engine analogy is reinforced by Huttons treatment of volcanoes as a kind of safety valve
Hutton put it this way: A volcano is not made on purpose to frighten superstitious people into fi ts of piety and devotion, nor to overwhelm devoted cities with destruction; a volcano should be considered as a spiracle to the subterranean furnace, in order to prevent the unneces- sary elevation of land, and fatal eff ects of earthquakes
Hutton, by using the idea of a safety-valve in this way, deepens the analogy between the Earth-machine and the steam engine and reinforces our belief that thinking about steam engines and about the Earth had a great deal to do with each other for both Hutton and (1)(2) If I am right in treating Watts steam engine as a chemical and mechanical device then it certainly squares well with Huttons vision of ‘this earth as a machine, constructed upon chemical as well as mechani- cal principles, by which its diff erent parts are all adapted, in form, in quality, and in quantity to a certain end…
Th ere is some evidence that geological questions were likely to spring to Watts mind when he conducted steam experiments and experiments on airs
Th is was certainly true in the early days of his collaboration with (1)(2)
Indeed, understanding Priestleys and Watts chemistry involves appreciating the ‘connectedness that they saw and assumed between phenomena that we have divided and demarcated
Our own later maps of knowledge impel us to subsume every move that Priestley made under controversies about ‘oxygen, ‘phlogiston and the ‘composition of water
Th is is a mistake
Robert Schofi eld long ago pointed out the danger of seeing Priestley as reactive (to Lavoisier and the theory of oxidation) when he was pursuing his own positive programmes of research: It is not immediately obvious … that his opposition to the theory of oxidation was a compulsive reaction which was to dominate Priestleys research until his death
Indeed the fi rst set of experiments [undertaken in Birmingham] seems wholly unre- lated to that controversy…the immediate motive appears to have been the geological interests of his fellow members of the Lunar (1)(2)
Priestley published on this work in a note prefi xed to a paper by William Withering in the Philosophical Transactions in 1782
Priestley was examining the extraction of air from various rocks and minerals, a line of inquiry that he reported on more fully in Experiments and Observations in 1786
Th e quantity of air released on heating was taken to be an indication of the mode of formation of the rock
Priestley argued, for example, that basalt and granite when heated produced too much air to be the product of volcanic action
Th ese experiments bore directly on the issues at stake between ‘plutonists who regarded fi re as the primary geological agent and ‘neptunists who stressed the importance of water
Schofi eld detects important continuities between these experiments and Priestleys earlier and later ones
All of them related to the natural economy of air – how air was produced in the fi rst place, and its consumption, production and revitalization through various processes
Th us, in one of his fi rst important chemical papers Priestley wrote: Considering this amazing consumption of air, by fi res of all kinds, volcanos &c
it becomes a great object of philosophical inquiry, to ascertain what change is made in the constitution of the air by fl ame, and to discover what provision there is in nature for remedying the injury which the atmosphere receives by this means
When, in the early 1780s, Priestley experimented on the extraction of air from substances of volcanic origin he was still concerned to gain insights into the consumption of air by volcanoes
And when, in what are usually seen as key documents in the water controversy, Priestley heated water in contact with cal- careous substances and claimed to produce air from water, he was completing the circle by showing how atmospheric air may have been produced in the fi rst place from water, and how natural processes might remedy its consumption
Th e experiments of John Warltire sparking mixtures of infl ammable and ordinary airs to produce water promised further insights into the same natural economy
Watt shared the broad outline and many of the details of this coherent con- ception of the chemistry of airs
Watts long-held belief about the conversion of water into air if high enough temperatures could be attained had meteorological signifi cance
Recall that when he advised Boulton of this idea in December
he noted that it solved the problem of the source of atmospheric air, as Priestley had already observed
Th e work that Priestley did for Boulton and Watt to explore the possibili- ties of using other airs for engines was also conceptually linked to this natural economy
Boulton and Watt were alert to the possibilities of using the capability of fl uids, or even solids, to release and reabsorb air to produce a vacuum and derive mechanical force thereby
In the letter in which he explained to Watt that he was setting Priestley to work on the question, Boulton gave details of what had impelled him to do so
One circumstance had been seeing in London ‘a Glass Vessell fi lld w[i]th >  air which became as instantaneously condensed when brought into contact with  as steam w[oul]d have been, & the same thing happens with ^ air…
Boulton explained further, with accompanying diagram (see Figure 5
) Now if you take a Glass tube hermetically seald at A & open at B – let the space between C & D be fi lld with mercury & the space between D&A be fi lled w[i]th water into which project as much ^ air or >  air as will saturate that  …  Th e moment you apply heat to the water, it gives out the air & ye instant you cool it that instant it is absorbed again by ye
Heat it again & it gives out air so as to raise the mercury to a consid- erable height…
Besides seeing the London experiment, Boulton had also been stimulated by a conversation with ‘Simcox45 who ‘mentioned to me the Idea of detaching fi x- able air from chalk & then in an instant reabsorbing it
Boulton reported being alarmed by this prospect until he was convinced of the ‘impracticability of it
He remained convinced, however, that what could not be accomplished with solids might be with fl uids, and argued that they should take out a patent against the eventuality: Figure 5
Diagram from Boulton to Watt, 21 July 1781
(Archives of Soho, MS3147/3/5, by Kind Permission Birmingham City Archives) a patent for making Engines by means of alternately emiting & reabsorbing all & severaly the diff erent airs, Gasses, permanently elastic fl uids, or by what soever other name they might be calld, seting forth that whereas there are several substances that do contain or are capable of containing several sorts of air acids &c in a fi xed or solid state & that such airs &c are readily detached from, or are emitted by such substances upon being heated & again upon being coold are readily reabsorbed by the s[ai]d substance & thereby a vacuum may be obtained & Mechanical force derived
In the case of the emission and reabsorption of airs by solid substances the links to geological processes are clear
While Watts reply calmed Boulton down, convincing him that such schemes, whether using solids or fl uids, were imprac- ticable, the fact that they could be contemplated at all confi rms the existence in Watts circle of the connections I am claiming between thinking about engines, about the chemistry of airs, geology and meteorology
Another example, this time of the perceived connection between steam experiments and geology, comes twenty years later, when, in retirement, Watt repeated many of his steam experiments, much of the actual work being done by his assistant, John (1)(2) Th e papers dealing with Southerns calculations of the elasticity of steam dating from 1803 contain an interesting document anno- tated ‘Considerations upon the power of steam to produce Earthquakes by Mr Southern 1803
Th is is worth considering in a little detail
Th e ‘Considerations begins with an attempt by Southern (one of many in these papers) to establish the series that elasticities of steam follow
It is recorded that ‘(1) (1) found that the specifi c gravity of steam of atmospheric elasticity was 2000 … times lighter than water
[S]upposing then that if its elasticity is increased its requisite density increases in the same ratio, it would be when equal to
atmospheres as dense as water
Th e question is then asked, what temperature would give this
Th e calculation results in an answer of ‘1107 of Farenheit [sic]
It then becomes apparent that this work is preparatory to dealing with a question about the Earth – whether ‘the powers of steam can be ‘contemplated with the view to their suffi  cientcy [sic] to produce Earthquakes, Volcanoes &c
Th e answer provided is that saturated steam could never achieve the elasticities to do this, but that unsaturated steam might: ‘though one may not look for saturated steam denser than water perhaps & consequently only of the elasticity just mentioned[,] unsaturated steam may be adequate to these eff ects
Th e chain of reasoning arrives at the proposition that a cubic mile of water raised to a temperature of 5100º within a cavity in the Earth of 32 cubic miles would ‘fi ll the … cavity with steam that would press on the whole of the surface with a force of 400 miles perpendicu- lar of water
Th is might I think produce earthquakes and volcanoes
Neither the detailed merits of this analysis, nor where it might fi t in the geo- logical controversies of the time, need detain us here
Th e key point is Southerns and Watts belief that the characteristics of steam (that is the chemistry of water and heat) were relevant to the solution of the problems of both the steam engine and the Earth-machine
Knowing this, the article ‘Steam by John Robison in the third edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica begins to look less eccentric than it otherwise might
When Robison segued from a sober discussion of the boiling of water in a kettle into rhapsodies on earthquakes and other geologi- cal phenomena49 he was in fact refl ecting a natural philosophical worldview still common among his circle and likely shared by Watt himself
Steam in Th e Botanic Garden and ‘Sentimental Empiricism Another member of the Lunar Society, Erasmus Darwin, took an abiding interest in the steam engine, an interest at once visionary, poetic and scientifi c
We fi nd in sources produced by and linked to him, further confi rmation of the chemical nature of the invention as seen by Boulton and Watts contemporaries and also of its close association with meteorological ideas and understandings
Even before Watt came on the scene Darwin and Boulton were discuss- ing steam engines
As the story goes, Boultons worries about the possible lack of water power to sustain his manufactory led him to serious investigation of steam engines from the mid-1760s
He pursued his own steam project until he met Watt in 1768
Writing to Boulton in December 1765, Darwin expressed curiosity about how Boultons steam engine had been received by Dr Franklin and what Franklins observations on it had been
Darwin, Boulton and Dr Wil- liam Small had been discussing boilers and their optimal design
Th is question involved them in considering the phenomenon of evaporation
Darwin wanted to know ‘your fi nal opinion and Dr Smalls on the important Question, whether Evaporation is as the Surface of boiling Water, or not
– or if it be as the Surface of the Vessel, exposed to the Fire, which I rather suspect
He continued: For if you boil Water in a Florence-Flask, you see bubbles arising from the Bottom, these are Steam, as they mount they are condensed again by the cold supernatant Fluid, and their Sides clapping together make that Noise called Simmerring(1)dly When Water boils in the Æolipile or closed Tea-Kettle, what a Quantity of Steam
– is this only as the upper Surface
I humbly conceive not – but as that Surface in contact with the (1)(2)
Th is question of where the boiling took place was crucial to the design of the boiler of the steam engine
Darwin sought from Boulton his, and Smalls, view on ‘the best way of constructing the Boiler for the above Purposes
Th e question of which variable related to the quantity of steam produced was also of theoretical signifi cance
Darwin was interested in what Franklin thought because Frank- lin subscribed to the solution theory of evaporation
Solution theory would be compatible with the proportionality of quantity of steam to surface area of the water to be boiled; solution, in any case, requiring solvent (air) and solute (water) to be in contact
Th e quantity of steam produced being proportional to the surface area of the boiler in contact with the fi re would be consistent with the idea that steam is compounded from water and heat, or the matter of fi re, since this could occur, and did on that theory occur, without contact with the air
At about the same time, but apparently independently, Watt was also considering ‘boyler design in much the same light
Over twenty years later Darwins interest in evaporation and ‘devaporation persisted
In his celebrated paper on ‘frigorifi c experiments published in the Philosophical Transactions53 he drew close analogies between what goes on in the steam engine and in meteorological processes
Darwins central concern in this paper was to show that many meteorological phenomena could be accounted for by applying a basic insight to the issue of movements of air in the atmos- phere
Th at basic insight was that elastic fl uids, when mechanically expanded, withdraw heat from their surroundings
In considering the application of this to the ‘devaporation of aerial Moisture Darwin suggested that when the barom- eter drops, for whatever reason, the lower parts of the air become expanded and, in expanding, extract heat from the vapour contained in them
Th e vapour condenses and it is precipitated in showers
But a remarkable and little-noticed eff ect is that ‘the deduction of a small quantity of heat from a cloud or province of vapour, compared with the quantity of heat which was necessary to raise the vapour from water, will devaporate the whole
Darwin explained this as fol- lows: if ‘a small part of a province of vapour is suddenly condensed, a vacuum is formed and the proximate bodies of vapour expand into it
Th us ‘a large area of vapour, perhaps of many miles in circumference, becomes more or less expanded, by this expansion cold is produced, ‘and the whole is devaporated
Th en comes the analogy with the steam engine: Th is very circumstance exactly takes place in the famous steam-engine of (1)(2) WATT and BOULTON; which, from the happy combination of chemical and mechanical power, may justly be esteemed the fi rst machine of human invention
In this excellent machine, aft er the cylinder is fi lled with steam, a communication is opened between this reservoir of steam and a small cell, which is kept cold by surrounding water, and free from air … What then happens
Th e corner of the steam in the cylinder next to this vacuum (with which it now communicates) rushes into it, and the whole steam in the cylinder is thus suddenly expanded and instantly devaporated…
Th us, according to Darwin, the process that enables Watts separate condenser to work is the same as that which operates, for example, at the beginning of thun- derstorms, when ‘a small black cloud at fi rst appears, in a few minutes the whole heaven is covered with condensing vapour
It is worth noting also that in the above quotation Darwin confi rms the perception of the improved steam engine as a chemical device
By referring to it as the ‘fi rst machine of human invention he means, presumably, the fi rst in rank rather than the fi rst in time
Th is pre-emi- nence is awarded because of the machines ‘happy combination of chemical and mechanical power, the latter deriving from, and being used in concert with, the power derived from application of the knowledge of the chemistry of steam
Darwin had taken a long and close interest in Watts steam-engine improve- ments and famously gave the steam engine a place in his poem Th e Botanic Garden: NYMPHS
You erewhile on simmering cauldrons playd, And calld delighted SAVERY to your aid; Bade round the youth explosive STEAM aspire In gathering clouds, and wingd the wave with fi re; Bade with cold streams the quick expansion stop
And sunk the immense of vapour to a drop
– Pressd by the ponderous air the Piston falls Resistless, sliding through its iron walls; Quick moves the balanced beam, of giant-birth, Wields his large limbs, and nodding shakes the earth
Th e fi rst thing to note about this passage is the tenor of the language, at once meteorological, mechanical and animist
Th e immediate notes on the passage recount the history of the steam engine from Savery through Worcester and Newcomen to Watt and (1)(2) Th ey also refer to its applications and future possibilities
As we saw in Chapter 2, material for Additional Note XI on the steam engine was contributed by Boulton and Watt themselves
Th e Note as published contains a version of the ‘Perfect Engine story intermediate between Watts letters of the time describing the invention and the ‘Plain Story that originated in the 1796 patent trials and was one of the two key versions to be propagated in the nineteenth century
More generally in Th e Botanic Garden we can discern Darwins partial assim- ilation of Lavoisian chemistry in developing his economy of nature
Darwin accepts the Lavoisian account of the decomposition and composition of water
He puts the explosive combination of infl ammable air and oxygene (which he still also denominates as dephlogisticated air) to work in various parts of the natural economy, including the upper reaches of the atmosphere, where their sparking he considered likely to produce instant summer rain, and in the forma- tion of fi ssures in the Earth during its early history
However, Darwin also relied heavily on the ‘doctrine of elementary heat, which he identifi ed with Joseph Black and his followers
Darwin stated: A certain quantity of heat seems to be combined with all bodies besides the sensible quantity which gravitates like the electric fl uid amongst them
Th is combined heat or latent heat of (1)(2) Black, when set at liberty by fermentation, infl ammation, crystalliza- tion, freezing, or other chemical attractions producing new combinations, passes as a fl uid element into the surrounding bodies
And by thawing, diff usion of neutral salts in water, melting, and other chemical solutions, a portion of heat is attracted from the bodies in vicinity and enters into or becomes combined with the new solutions
He proff ered as an additional reason for belief in the doctrine his ideas about the absorption or release of heat when air is mechanically expanded or condensed
Darwin, for all he was the most accepting among the Lunar group of Lavoisiers new chemistry still conceived it within what Riskin60 has called a ‘sentimental empiricism, a view of the economy of nature which he still shared, I suggest, with James Hutton and with Watt and his other Lunar Society colleagues, and which was quite alien to the Lavoisian scheme
Although Darwin writes of ‘calorique as matter of heat in a way that assumes it is interchangeable with the doctrine of elementary heat in the Scottish tradition, we must regard this as obfuscating very real diff erences between them
In fact, through his poetry Darwin gave us the most evocative clue to this common quality in his own cosmology and that of Watt, Hutton, De Luc and other members of their circle; this approach pre- vailed over their substantive diff erences on specifi c issues in natural philosophy
It treated the steam engine as a local manifestation of a kind of chemical power that was ubiquitous in the economy of nature
Watts Steam Experiments Now let us look fi nally, and directly, at Watts experiments on steam and how they related to his steam-engine work
A small notebook in the Watt archives, most of it in Watts hand, contains notes about steam experiments, conducted in Figure 5
Page from Watts 1765 Experiments, with Kettle (1)(2) [Reproduced by kind permis- sion of Birmingham City Archives] 1765 or earlier and in the early 1780s
Notes were added in 1814 when Watt returned to these questions
Th ese are the real kettle experiments, which were arguably the inspiration for the myth of the kettle discussed in Chapter 1
On a page headed ‘1765 there begins a long account of Watts fi rst experiments on steam
Watt recalls fi nding that a greater quantity of injection water than expected was required to condense steam in the cylinder of a steam engine
In particular, more water was needed to condense the steam than should have been required to cool the quantity of water in the steam down below boiling point
Watt recalled (see Figure 5
): I took a bent Glass tube & inverted it into the nose of a tea kettle, the other end being immersed in Cold water
I found on making the kettle boil that tho there was only a small increase of the water in the frigeratory that it was become boiling hot
Th is I was surprised at & on telling it to Dr Black & asking him if it was possible that water under the form of steam could contain more heat than it did when water He told me that had long been a tenet of his…
In this experiment, Watt was arriving independently, sometime before 1765, at the fact of the latent heat of condensation of steam
What was the relationship between these experiments and Watts improve- ments in the steam engine
We need to recall what the key improvement of the separate condenser consisted of
In the Newcomen Engine cold water was injected into the cylinder on every stroke, condensing the steam and creating a partial vacuum so that the atmosphere forced the piston down
More steam was injected, and so the cycle continued
Th e idea of latent heat explained the initially surprising amount of cold water needed to condense the steam in the cylinder
However, latent heat was not central to the engine ineffi  ciency to which Watt addressed himself
Th e problem was that during condensation the cylinder itself was cooled by the injection water
Th e injected steam in the next cycle had to reheat the cylinder
Th e repeated reheating of the cylinder consumed a lot of fuel
When Watt recognized this ineffi  ciency, his fi rst idea was to construct the cylinder of wood, or some other material with a lower specifi c heat, and he conducted trials with various materials
Subsequently, Watt came up with the idea of the separate condenser
In this arrangement the cylinder was not repeat- edly cooled and reheated
Th e fuel saving so achieved was enormous and was the technical basis of the fi rm of Boulton & Watts success
Th e relationship between Watts investigations of the properties of steam and his improvements to the steam engine is not straightforward
Watt investigated a number of properties of steam
Following Black, he also conducted experi- ments on the boiling of water at lower pressures
Th is was linked to the creation of ‘back pressure in the cylinder when the injection water boiled as a result of the partial vacuum in the cylinder and the increased temperature produced by release of the latent heat of condensation of the steam
Arthur Donovan points out that Watts study of this ‘back pressure led to the formulation of the prob- lem to which the separate condenser would be a solution
Th is was expressed in terms of the departure of real from perfect engines
As Watt put it: to make a perfect steam-engine, it was necessary that the cylinder should be always as hot as the steam which entered it, and that the steam should be cooled down below 100° in order to exert its full powers
Th e gain by such construction would be dou- ble: – fi rst, no steam would be condensed on entering the cylinder; and secondly the power exerted would be greater as the steam was more cooled
It was at this point that the idea of the separate condenser occurred to (1)(2)
Th is idea depended on yet another property of steam, namely its ‘elasticity as a vapour
Watt realized that this property of elasticity meant that if an evacuated vessel were linked to the main cylinder, steam would rush into it
Once captured, the steam could be condensed by injection water without having to cool the cyl- inder signifi cantly
Here is an appropriate place to discuss Richard Hillss important and infl u- ential reconstruction of Watts route to the separate condenser
Hills presents the concept of the ‘perfect engine as the guiding idea here
His account runs the risk, in my view, of assimilating the concept to proto-thermodynamic physical ideas
I want to argue that for Watt in 1769 preventing the waste of steam, reduc- ing it theoretically to zero, was conceptualized chemically, but fi rst let me set out briefl y what I take to be Hillss argument
Hills begins with the famous story that during the winter of 1763–4 Watt, who was then an instrument maker with a shop at Glasgow University, was asked by Professor Anderson to repair a model of a Newcomen steam engine belong- ing to the natural philosophy class
According to Watts account he was surprised that the boiler on this model could not supply enough steam to keep the engine going
Watt set about studying what had been written about steam engines to try to understand the basic principles of their operation
Hills tells us that by September 1765 Watt used the term ‘perfect engine in a letter to Dr Lind: I have tried my small model of my perfect engine, which hitherto answers expecta- tion, and gives great, I may say greatest, hopes of success (for certainty could not be called hope), in greater model now far advanced; in short, I expect almost totally to prevent waste of steam, and consequently to bring the machine to its ultimatum
Th e standard of perfection in an engine was thus conceptualized by Watt in terms of the degree to which steam was wasted
In a perfect engine, none was
Th e concept gave Watt a standard against which to judge any working engine
So Watt was on the hunt for sources of waste
He knew that in the New- comen engine the cylinder had to be re-heated at each stroke, that is, a large quantity of steam had to enter, and give up its heat to, the cylinder before the latter became hot enough to be fi lled with steam that remained as steam
Th e injection of cold water into the cylinder in order to condense the steam within it and so create a vacuum was responsible for the cooling of the cylinder
Watts experiments convinced him that this was the single largest source of wastage of steam
Hills account beyond this traces Watts inspiration of the separate con- denser, and how that met the basic criteria that a ‘perfect engine demanded
He also discusses other problems with the Newcomen engine and how Watt dealt with those
What are we to make of this account
Watt certainly used the term ‘perfect engine at the time of his work on the improvement of the steam engine
He also deployed it in retrospective accounts, as we saw in Chapter 2, and it became popular among the fi rst generation of historians, including James Patrick (1)(2) But what work does the concept do
Once it establishes the idea of a perfect engine (which is itself little more than the idea that waste is occurring and that in the best sort of engine it would not) the answer has to be ‘not much
Hillss own account of Watts work in tack- ling various sources and aspects of waste does not need to invoke the idea at all, and it does not do so
Th at account is, in fact, all about heat, that is to say, about chemistry in the then contemporary understanding, certainly in Watts understanding
At one stage, in his most recent treatment of the subject, Hills acknowledges this very point: [Watt] … could never know that his concept of the perfect engine was fl awed
He considered that heat was some sort of chemical substance and regarded the engine as working by the pressure of steam
He thought it was essential to keep the cylinder as hot as the incoming steam all the time to avoid condensation and hence loss of pressure
But he could not know that heat is a form of energy which, when it is trans- formed into work and drives machinery, must decrease in temperature with the result that the cylinder must become colder during the working stroke
Th e reason for this dilemma was recognised only in the middle of the nineteenth century with the rise of thermodynamics…
Whilst ostensibly escaping presentism here, Hillss account actually embraces it in the judgement that Watts understanding of the ‘perfect engine concept was ‘fl awed rather than merely diff erent
Watts concept was only ‘fl awed on anach- ronistic criteria
It was precisely the chemical interpretation that distinguished Watts ‘perfect engine concept from that of nineteenth-century thermodynam- ics
Th us even if we grant the centrality of the idea of the ‘perfect engine to Watts reasoning, in order to avoid anachronism we still have to conceive of that perfection in terms of the chemistry of heat
When heat was thought of as a substance involved in the chemical formation of steam, as Watt thought of it, then it was only necessary to supply enough heat in order to achieve perfection
I think that the concept of the ‘perfect engine has been seized upon for its appar- ent summative potential
Th e term evokes ideas clearly or dimly recollected of the ‘ideal engine from physics and thermodynamics
To use the term ‘perfect engine as the organizing principle for an account of Watts steam engine is to conjure up other ideas such as the bulk properties of steam
Logically, given what we now believe about latent heat, namely that it is a non-chemical phenomenon, the conception of the perfect engine was a major inspiration for the separate condenser idea
Watts reasoning did not involve the chemistry of heat directly, and it is tempting to see it as a kind of proto-thermodynamics, given that it seems to deal with the bulk thermal properties of a ‘working substance
But the essence of a working substance in that sense is that it operates as a vehicle of heat transfer and nothing more
Th e theory of the heat engine becomes independent of the working substance
Th is could never be the case for Watt since his conception of the steam engine depended so intimately on the chemical composition of the steam, which varied according to the amount of heat chemically combined with it, that is latent within it
Ben Marsden has the right idea when he warns his readers against importing nineteenth-century concepts into Watts time
Certainly Watt was not trying to maximize ‘energy output or conversion, he was seeking to minimize waste
But the concept of ‘perfect engine is susceptible of similar misunderstandings
Once the meaning of the term has been explained as an engine that does not waste steam it carries no further meaning
As an abstraction, unlike ‘ideal engine, it does no further work since it has no further content
Th e story of Watts perfect engine can stand
As we have seen, Watt did use the term at a crucial juncture to describe to others what he was doing
Th e story is undoubtedly true when that term is understood as Watt and his contemporar- ies might have understood it
It may well be, as Hills suggests, that the term was borrowed from other contemporary areas of technology practice
Perhaps the concept guided Watt to the idea that the central problem was that of the waste of steam
All these suggestions are fi ne and useful
Th e problem arises when Watts ‘perfect engine elides historiographically into notions of ‘ideal engine of the sort that was to become important in the nineteenth century
When that happens we think we have understood Watt, but we have not
Th ere is still work to do
Let us return now to Watts experiments on steam and latent heat
In late February and early March 1781, Watt resumed experiments on latent heat: Th e straight end of a Pipe was fi xed on the Spout of a Tea kettle from which the pipe inclined upwards so that the Bent end was about 2 feet higher than the Spout of the Tea kettle
Th e Tea Kettle was fi lled with Water halfway up the entry of the spout
Th e Lid was fi xed Steam tight with some oat meal dough
Th e pipe from the tea kettle led into a pan containing water
Watt measured the starting heat, and weight, of the water in the pan
Th en steam from the kettle was Figure 5

Watts Expansive Working, from 1782 (1)(2) [From: (1)(1) Muirhead, Th e Origin and Progress of the Mechanical Inventions of James Watt (London, 1854), vol(1), plate viii]
allowed to condense in the pan and the fi nishing heat and weight of the water in the pan were recorded
Th e experiment was repeated a number of times
When he reviewed these experiments, in 1814, Watt tabulated them70 as in Figure 5
It can be seen that Watt calculated the ‘Total, sensible & (1)(2) Heat (Figure 5
, column 7)
In the 1780s, Watt believed that the sum of the latent and sensible heats was a constant
Th is idea is the basis of what was known into the nineteenth century as ‘Watts Law
It was as we have seen, important to Watts thinking about the composition of water in the early 1780s and was also closely related to his exploration of the principle of ‘expansive working of the steam engine, which he explained in a patent taken out in 1782
Expansive working was ultimately about saving steam
It was about the ‘steam economy in the steam engine
Watt observed that he could refrain from injecting steam into the cylinder through- out the cycle
Instead he considered what would happen if the injection of steam ceased one quarter of the way through the expansion stroke
Th e steam would continue to expand at decreasing pressure
Watt worked out what the average pressure would be using such expansive working, and he came up with a fi gure of 0
(where 1 is the pressure when steam is being injected)
Th e average pres- sure using expansive working was more or less halved
But Watt found that the amount of steam used was a quarter of the amount used in normal working
Note that in the diagram representing this taken from the 1782 patent (Fig- ure 5
) Watt describes the line KL as representing ‘the powers of the Steam when the Piston is at their respective places
He is tracing the declining elasticity of the steam and to him this meant the rate at which the combined latent heat in steam was being lost and converted into sensible heat
Th is is where ‘Watts Law comes in
If it holds, then, given a measure of the sensible heat, the amount of latent heat, and therefore the elasticity of the steam can be determined
So, how should we summarize the chemistry of the steam engine
We see that the link between latent heat and Watts improvements was a complex and contingent one
Donald Fleming went too far when he rejected the link entirely because it was not direct
Certainly the innovation of the separate condenser relied for most of its gains in effi  ciency on the fact that the cylinder was not being repeatedly heated and cooled
Th ose gains would be achieved regardless of the existence of latent heat
Nevertheless, the formulation of the problem of back pressure to which the separate condenser was a solution, did owe a lot to Watts understanding of latent heat and to other of his experiments on the properties of steam
Th ose properties were marginal to Watts key initial improvement, but not wholly irrelevant to it
Th ey were not the proximate cause of the key improvement but were certainly part of his overall understanding of what was going on in the engine and a clue to the problem of the waste of steam and high fuel consumption
Th e later development of the idea of expansive working, however, and the pursuit of ‘steam economy, did involve Watt in thinking much more closely about what was happening in the cylinder
Here the composition of the steam in terms of how much latent heat it contained in various circum- stances became crucial
What I wish to emphasize is that throughout all these experiments Watt understood the activity of steam as being a result of its chemical character as a compound of water and heat
Th e elasticity of steam was the basis of the force that it exerted in order to drive the piston and was also the property that allowed the separate condenser to work
Th e degree of elasticity of the steam in the cyl- inder of the engine depended directly on the amount of latent heat combined in the steam
In short, all key aspects of the engines working were the product of steams chemical character
Watt saw the improvement of the engine as a mat- ter of learning more about the chemical changes occurring in the steam so as to be able to take manipulative advantage of them
Th e narrative giving pride of place to Watts concept of the ‘perfect engine is, when properly understood, compatible with this position
But I think it gives hostage to historiographical fortune by encouraging anachronistic analogies with ideal engines and diverting our attention from the chemical understanding of the steam engine that under- lay Watts innovations
– 147 – 6 THE INDICATOR UNDERSTOOD,  OR WHY WATT WAS NOT A PROTO- THERMODYNAMICIST Later nineteenth-century histories of the steam engine were most oft en written by practising engineers and scientists
Th ey exhibited the common tendency of practitioners to write ‘Whig history, that is, to interpret past historical actors and actions in modern terms
Th is genre of literature, then, assimilated Watt to the modern traditions and conceptions of thermodynamics
In its turn this later nineteenth-century literature has left  its mark on modern historical writings
I am concerned in this chapter with two processes of assimilation of Watt to thermodynamics
Th e fi rst involves conceptual assimilation of Watt to mid- nineteenth-century understandings of ‘energy
A typical example of conceptual assimilation is an essay by Keith (1) Laidler, which presents Watt and his engine as practical progenitors of that science
Certainly the steam engine was an important resource for those developing thermodynamic understandings
But to picture Watt and his engine ‘pushing in that direction is problematic
Even sophisticated and nuanced treatments of the issue fall into a similar trap
Th e eminent historian of technology, Donald Cardwell, implicitly placed the work of Black and Watt on heat into a tradition of the ‘physics of heat, a line leading to the ‘Rise of Th ermodynamics
I have already argued that the excellent and detailed account of the origins of Watts key invention by Richard (1) Hills3 is also on dangerous territory when deploying the concept of the ‘perfect engine in telling that history
Although the term does come from Watts own accounts of how he arrived at his invention, and therefore must in some sense be reliable,
what the term meant to Watt is all too easily lost sight of and elided into later visualizations of ideal heat engines that every modern student learns about as the basis of thermodynamics
Th e second process of assimilation involved the steam indicator, a device that, because of its mid-nineteenth-century involvement with thermodynamic theory, was oft en taken as some kind of natural bridge between that theory and Watt, who invented the instrument
As I will show, the rather mysterious, chequered and just plain misunderstood, history of this device encouraged a ‘telescoping of its later and early history
Th at telescoping in its turn facilitated an easy elision between Watts conceptual world and that of the thermodynamicists
Watt, Heat and Energy Th e elisions which concern me here, and which I will reveal in the case of under- standings of the indicator, have a long history
As we saw in Chapter 2, some of them were perpetrated during Watts self-fashioning in the early nineteenth cen- tury and entered the historiography of the Watt camp including the major works by (1) (1) (1)(2) From there, as well as from their own technical literature, the thermodynamicists used them to understand and shape their own history
A particularly concentrated and revealing source is the sequence of Watt Anniver- sary Addresses given at the Greenock Philosophical Society from 1865
Th ere was a long tradition in Greenock of celebrating the anniversary of Watts birth dating back to the dinners and lunches of the Watt Club from the 1820s
Th e formation of the Greenock Philosophical Society in 1861, which absorbed the membership of the Watt Club, placed these aff airs on a more formal basis and involved addresses given by numerous prominent engineers and scientists
Th e occasions, like the Watt Anniversary Dinners long held in Glasgow itself under the auspices of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders of Scotland, were important to, and supported by, the west of Scotland engineering and shipbuild- ing community whose academic centre was the University of (1)(2) Given the stature and importance of that community to the world of engineering in the later nineteenth century, the Watt Anniversary became much more than a local celebration – a fact attested to by the speakers that it attracted
Th e fi rst Watt Anniversary Address was in fact given by none other than James Joule in 1865
Joules treatment of Watts ideas on heat is worth recounting at some length both for our immediate purpose of seeing how the elisions I identify were made by him, and for more general interest, since to my knowledge its content has never been discussed before
Donald Cardwell, in his biography of Joule, noticed the Address and observed that it was a truly rare occasion, being probably the only public lecture that Joule ever gave to an audience other than a small local gathering
Cardwell does not, however, venture into the contents of the (1)(2)
Joule spoke to the Greenock Philosophical Society in the Watt Institution on 19 January 1865, ‘On Some Facts in the Science of Heat Developed Since the Time of Watt
Th e bulk of the lecture was given over to a description of Joules own, already famous, experimental demonstration of the mechanical equivalent of heat and to the work of his friends William Th omson and Macquorn Rankine in devel- oping the science of thermodynamics
But Joule could hardly avoid a historical sketch of developments concerning heat between Watts time and the mid-nine- teenth century
Th e way that he positioned Watt, or failed to position him, in that sketch is revealing
Joule noted the obvious fi rst – that they were assembled to mark the anniversary of the birth of ‘the greatest mechanician that this or any other country has ever produced
Th e term ‘mechanician, especially from the lips of a man famous for determining the mechanical equivalent of heat, seems to place Watt preferentially as a student and exponent of the mechanical side, rather than the heat side, of that equivalence
Joule also observed that the purpose of the lec- ture was to ‘refl ect on some of those facts of physical science which are intimately connected with the discoveries of Watt, and which give a rational explanation of the operation of that wonderful machine which will for all time be associated with his name
Once again, Watt is associated with the engine, but, at this stage at least, only equivocally with the ‘rational explanation of its operation
Joule then launched into an account of the history of ideas about the nature of heat
He ventured that the conception of heat as elemental, held by the Ancients, was vastly improved in the hands of Bacon, Newton and other great men of the seventeenth century who considered heat as ‘a motion among the particles of matter
Th is, together with Newtons announcement, as Joule depicted it, of the principle of the conservation of energy, laid the foundation of the science of heat
Th en, in the eighteenth century, came a retrograde step
Here is Joules account of the nature of that step and the reasons for it: Th e overthrow of Alchemy and the rise of Chemistry, with its defi nite elements and combining proportions, seem, singularly enough, to have caused a retrograde move- ment in the sister science
Still, as more precise ideas began to prevail respecting the individuality of diff erent species of matter, it was natural enough to attempt to estab- lish a material theory of the then called ‘imponderables, more especially as such a theory was found to give a very intelligible explanation of many calorifi c phenomena; such, for instance, as the absorption of heat when a body assumes another form, as, for example, when ice becomes water, or when water becomes steam
Th e thermal laws in connexion with such changes of state were demonstrated by the celebrated Black, and nothing could appear more natural than to suppose with him that the change of condition was owing to the union of the substance with Caloric, which latter, being neutralized by the combination, ceased to act on the senses, and was therefore called ‘latent heat
Th is is the closest that we come in the entire lecture to a treatment of Watts ideas about heat
Although Watts name is not mentioned at this point, his presence in the thought is unmistakable
He was the person for whom ‘nothing could ever appear more natural than to adopt, following Black, the view that changes of state involved the chemical union of substances with caloric
Watt is hereby excused for his views on the nature and role of heat
He was swept up by a whole tradition that had gone astray – the science of imponderables
He followed (1)(2) In any case both Black and Watt transcended this situation
Th ey had the ‘thermal laws, which were disengageable, Joule implied, from the question of the nature of heat
Such a view of the ‘thermal laws was in direct line of descent from the general strategy of Watts self-fashioning in the later years of his life
Th e rest of his history of heat involves Joule paying obeisance to the work of Rumford and Davy, which he regarded as decisive in favour of the mechanical theory of heat
However, ‘frivolous objections led to it being forgotten so that ‘the several naturalists who more recently have recommenced the enquiry have done so quite independently, and on ground of their own selection
Watt disap- pears from the lecture for a while, as Joule recounts his own work and that of Th omson and (1)(2) But, in concluding, Joule says this: I must now close this very imperfect outline of a few of the discoveries which have taken place since the time of that great man whose birth we are now commemorating
I thank you for the opportunity you have given me of discoursing on results which would have been most interesting to Watt, and for which he himself largely prepared the way
And I trust you will permit me also to express my satisfaction at having had it in my power to speak in Scotland of a theory which Scotland was the earliest country to welcome, and which your countrymen have done more than any others to com- plete and extend
So, even as Watts own ideas about heat and the steam engine are quietly acknowl- edged as defl ected from the main line of development, he is also assimilated to that main line
Th is is done by picturing Watt as preparing the way for it (pre- sumably through the application of the ‘thermal laws to the design of the steam engine from which the likes of Rankine has, as it were, reverse engineered the laws of thermodynamics), as being (virtually
) interested in it, and as being part of that company of Scotsmen who had advanced it
Henry Dyers Watt Lecture of 1889 on ‘Th e Steam Engine since the Days of Watt confronted Watts ideas about heat more directly
He did this through a consideration of Watts invention of the separate condenser
Dyer, following and quoting from Watts own corrective account in Robisons A System of Mechanical Philosophy explained that while it would have been possible for Watt to derive his engine improvements from the concept of latent heat, this ‘does not seem to have been the way in which this discovery was developed
In a prior exposition of Blacks doctrine of latent heat, Dyer stated that ‘Black fi rst showed … that heat may enter a body and cause it to change its molecular condition, while the temperature as indicated by the thermometer remains constant, in other words that the heat becomes latent
Th e phrase ‘molecular condition is, of course, a modernization of Blacks actual conception
In fact Dyer goes on to give this rendering of what Black and Watt believed
According to the material theory of heat, he says, it was supposed: that heat was an imponderable, gaseous fl uid, which, entered the pores of bodies, and caused them to expand, and which combined with their substance and became latent or hidden when they pass from the solid into the liquid state, or from the liquid to the vaporous, and which re-appears when the passage is reversed
Although this theory is no longer held, still the name latent is retained, as it expresses clearly enough what actually takes place
Whether through ignorance or design, Dyer here is attributing to Black and Watt a curious combination of a chemical material theory of heat and an Irvin- ist, non-chemical material theory of the sort that became popular in the early nineteenth century
Th is is a good example of the sorts of elisions that converted Watts and Blacks theories of heat into something assimilable to nineteenth-cen- tury physical conceptions
At the end of the historical excursion Dyer makes an interesting and revealing statement that his main reason for taking the reader on it was not to weigh the relative merits of Black and Watt but rather to illustrate the fact that when we study the history of the steam engine we fi nd that the great improvements which have been made in it have not always been the result of an exact appreciation of the full extent of the laws which govern them, but rather of clear-sighted observation of experiments on the part of men gift ed with mechanical genius, who have perceived the direction in which these laws tend…
Dyers solution to the dilemma about what to do with the disjunction between Watts understanding of heat in relation to the steam engine and that given by nineteenth-century physics was to elevate that disjunction to the level of a his- torical generalization about the relationship between theory and practice
Watts accomplishment was the product of his application of clear-sighted experiment and mechanical genius assisted by his perception of the ‘tendency of natural law
We are not far here from Cardwells depiction of Watt as a proto-thermody- namicist, as we see when Dyer precedes his discussion of Carnots work that ‘laid the foundations of the thermodynamical theory of heat engines with the obser- vation that ‘Watt seems to have perceived, if not the law, at least some of the conditions of maximum effi  ciency of steam engines considered as heat engines
Dyer simply assumed that Watt had the modern concept of a ‘heat engine
Similar anachronistic treatments of Watt pervaded more accessible accounts
Th us (1) (1) Forbes in his Preliminary Dissertation to the eighth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, implied Watts knowledge of ‘energy
Discussing the Cornish engines of the early nineteenth century, which achieved effi  ciencies well in advance of Watts own engines, Forbes made two points
First he claimed those engines for Watt in the sense that ‘they do not contain a single contrivance of any importance … which was not the unaided invention of (1)(2) Watt
Th en, immediately, he assimilated Watt and ideas of ‘energy: ‘In the Cornish engine we see the Energy of Heat rendered available to an extent which the inventor himself [Watt] would at one time have thought scarcely credible
Note that what Forbes attributes to Watt here is surprise at the amount of energy made available, not surprise at the very concept of energy itself
By so doing his treat- ment presumes continuity between Watts conceptual world and the world of ‘energy
Th e engineer (1) (1) Ewing, who wrote the new article on Watt for the ninth edition of the Britannica, added his own contribution to this tendency by describing Watt as ‘having had ideas greatly in advance of his age regarding what is now called energy
Watt might not have had the term, Ewing thereby claimed, but he had the idea
All these authors – Cardwell, Joule, Dyer, Forbes and Ewing – were engaged in exploring the terms and conditions on which Watts heat experiments can be assimilated to the main line of development of thermodynamics
Th ey have dif- ferent answers to the question and, we might think, varying degrees of success
But they are all engaged in the same sort of exercise, that is, fi nding a conceptual or procedural reason for attaching Watt to the nineteenth-century energy theo- rists and thermodynamicists via a line of descent
An alternative way of making this attachment, and one that became increasingly popular during the nine- teenth century, was via the indicator and the indicator diagram
Th e indicator – the device that we saw placed in Watts right hand in the commemorative statue placed outside the Watt Memorial Engineering and Nav- igation School in Greenock – played a central role in this process of assimilating Watt to nineteenth-century thermodynamics
For Watt this was a device with which he thought that he could measure directly the state of the steam in a work- ing engine
In fact, the indicator and the diagrams produced by it are not usually seen in that way because, once again, the historical fog created by that greatest of nineteenth-century scientifi c developments, the science of thermodynamics, has partially obscured it
Th e Indicator Diagram and the Transition from Chemistry to ‘Physics Th e origins of the science of thermodynamics (of the relations between heat and motion) as developed by Carnot, Clapeyron, Clausius, Joule, Th omson and Rankine from the 1820s into the 1850s is routinely traced back to the world of the steam engine
Th is is the example, par excellence, of technology-driven sci- entifi c progress, as captured in the famous dictum that ‘science owes more to the steam engine than the steam engine does to science16
Th e ‘indicator diagram is usually treated as a crucial link between Watts steam engine work and the subse- quent development of thermodynamics
Th e indicator diagram is thus regarded as a precursor of the insights of that science
Once again, ‘precursoritis proves an obstacle to understanding
I argue that the indicator diagram, in Watts hands, was not about the physics of heat but rather about diagnosing the chemical char- acteristics of the steam
Pictured in Figure 6
is an example of the mature indicator diagram tech- nology, dating from about 1840
Th e apparatus was attached to the cylinder of a steam engine
A small piston moved a pencil on the chart in accordance with the pressure in the engines main cylinder
Th e chart itself moved laterally in response to the movement of the piston in the main cylinder and so its ‘travel was in proportion to the working volume of the cylinder at any given time in the cycle
In tracing the origins of the science of energy, the indicator diagram is understandably given an important place
Th us Crosbie Smith says of this device, as developed by Watt and John Southern: ‘Th is ‘indicator diagram, the area of which represented the power developed by the engine, allowed for adjust- ment of the engine in order to maximize useful work
Th e indicator diagram, more widely known from the 1820s, would subsequently become, in Rankines terminology, the ‘diagram of energy
For many purposes, this assumption of continuity between the device developed by Southern and Watt and the instru- mental and conceptual world of Rankine is useful and unproblematic
But for our current historical purposes it represents a problem, an obstacle to under- standing Watts conceptual world
We need to take Watt out of this ‘main line of development of energy physics, and to try to see the indicator diagram as he fi rst saw it, not as others subsequently reinterpreted it
Figure 6
Indicator Diagram (1)(2) [Reproduced with permission from Science Museum, London, Science & Society Picture Library] In an important sense the indicator diagram was developed because of a press- ing technical need
When steam engines were pumping water out of mines, or pumping it for use with water wheels, relatively simple calculations of quantities of water raised through measured distances could be used to provide a measure of power
However, once the rotative steam engine was applied to the powering of machinery, the task became more diffi  cult
Barometric-style pressure gauges were used but these could only supply maximum and minimum pressures in the cylinder and thereby an average pressure
Th e indicator diagram, as developed by Watt and Southern, in 1796 was also initially conceived as a way of measur- ing average pressure
But it was subsequently ‘realized that a continuous index of value could be obtained and that the area enclosed by the traced curve was a measure of the power developed by the engine at a given speed (see Figure 6
)
Th is technique was thus an eminently practical one
Th e indicator diagram was something of an ‘underground technology for many years
Although it was used by Boulton & Watts engineers in building and installing steam engines in a number of countries, it was not widely known
Card- well claims that it was a well-guarded secret
An incomplete description of it was given in an article in the Quarterly Journal of Science in 1822
Watts descrip- tion of the indicator, fi nally published in the same year in Brewsters edition of Robisons A System of Mechanical Philosophy, described only the early, non- recording, type of instrument and so left  out altogether some essential parts of the mechanism
Th e British steam expert John Farey apparently did not learn of the indicator until 1819
Some Boulton & Watt men who were erecting a steam engine in Russia had made an indicator, and this came into Fareys possession during a visit to St Petersburg in that year
Farey testifi ed before a Parliamentary Committee on the Patent Laws in 1829 that he had made an indicator on the strength of this and communicated the idea and the process to others, including the author of the paper in the Quarterly Journal of (1)(2) Th is was one, rather roundabout, way that the indicator made its way into the generality of steam- engine practice in (1)(2)21 But there were other channels
Th e article in the Quarterly Journal was dated from Glasgow, 14 February 1822 and signed ‘(1) (1) Jun
Other clues as to the identity of its author include his statement that the indicator was used in ‘our works and was made from a description provided by ‘(1)(2) Field of London
It was also observed that the instruments were now made by ‘(1)(2) Hutton of the Anderston Foundry
On the strength of this information, Dickinson and Jenkins believed that ‘(1) (1) Jun was probably Mr Hutton or his son
However, it seems much more likely that the mysterious author was in fact Henry Houldsworth Jr (1797–1867)
Th e Houldsworth family had founded cotton-spinning companies in Glasgow and Manchester, and the Glasgow branch established the Anderston (1)(2) Henry Jr became a partner sometime in the 1820s in the Manchester cotton-spinning business founded by his uncle, Th omas Houldsworth, but in the early 1820s Henry junior was still based in (1)(2) He was much interested in innovations in machinery, being implicated in the processes of technology transfer in the textile industry, including by industrial espionage, between the United States and Britain at about that time
Later in his career he was to take out a number of patents
He was accused in the 1830s of unjustly exploiting the ingenuity of his workmen
Th ese aspects of his activities suggest a man who would not rest content for Boulton, Watt and (1)(2) to keep the indicator under wraps
Th e Houldsworths were no strangers either to Boulton & Watt engines, or to the indicator
Boulton & Watt steam engines were installed in Houlds- worth family concerns in both Manchester and (1)(2) One of the earliest indicator diagrams preserved in the Boulton & Watt collection was made in March 1803 at Th omas Houldsworths mill in Manchester, the diagram show- ing what gain was made by expansive working and giving information about the valve settings
Correspondence in the Boulton & Watt papers seems to show that various manufacturing operators of steam engines tried to get hold of their own indicators
Whilst the request from Mr Wedgwood to Boulton & Watt for an indicator ‘for his own use that he may try his engine under diff erent parts of the machinery, might have been acceded to, it is unlikely that other requests would
As late as 1835 a request to Watt Jr to borrow an indicator was met with the unhelpful reply that Boulton Watt and (1)(2) did not make indicators for sale and that all their instruments were out being used by their engine erectors
Boulton & Watt employees such as Haden, who erected an engine at Houldsworths in 1807, used the indicator in setting up and tuning engines and so gave their clients a tantalizing view of the possibilities of the device
But it was unlikely that those clients would have been supplied with a device of their own
While all the details are not clear, it does seem likely that the 1822 article in the Quarterly Journal was by Henry Houldsworth Jr and was an outcome of an already longstanding acquaintance of the Houldsworth family with the use of indicators and an equally longstanding frustration of attempts to gain control of one
(1) (1) Juns reference to Mr Field as the source of the description of the indicator that his company built is almost certainly a reference to Joshua Field (1781–1863), one of the founders of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1818, and a long-term partner in Maudsley, Sons and (1)(2) Field was an expert on marine steam engines and in that market he became a competitor of Boulton, Watt and (1)(2) In 1821 Field made a tour of the industrial areas of the Midlands, which included a visit to (1)(2)26 Perhaps on that tour he managed to procure details of the indicator that were passed on to Houldsworth and, reinforcing information from Farey, issued via ‘(1) (1) (1)(2) in the Quarterly (1)(2)
We should note, as the above account shows us, that considerable techni- cal distance, and quiet industrial contention, separated the indicator of

from that of 1840 and beyond
Even before knowledge of the indicator became widespread, however, it does appear that Boulton & Watt engineers produced numerous indicator diagrams in the early decades of the nineteenth century that may have come to others attention
By mid-century the devices themselves and their practical use wherever steam engines were employed were well established
But what is the story of their penetration into the world of engineering science
In 1834 something looking, as an inscription, very much like the indica- tor diagram appeared in a paper published by Benoît-Pierre-Emile Clapeyron in the Journal de lEcole Polytechnique (see Figure 6
)
In the history of ther- modynamics, this paper is regarded as having given eff ective voice for the fi rst time to the key ideas of Sadi Carnot, upon which later fi gures, notably William Th omson and Rankine would build
In Clapeyrons hands the indicator diagram became an abstract representation of the cycle of a heat engine
Th ere is some circumstantial evidence linking Clapeyron to the indicator diagram as used by Boulton & Watt employees
Clapeyron was in Russia in the 1820s and he may have learned about the indicator diagram there from Boulton & Watt engineers working in St (1)(2)28 It was certainly whilst in Russia that Clapeyron learned of Carnots Réfl exions sur la puissance motrice du feu,29 and Clapeyron planned his ‘Mémoire whilst in St (1)(2) Cardwell sees the ‘Mémoire as a crucial bridge between the work of Watt and that of the sophisticated theo- reticians of a later generation
Th ere is no doubt that later theorists, including William Th omson (Lord Kelvin), were very familiar with the practicalities of Watts steam engines and, indeed, with the use of the indicator diagram, in its mature form, to measure ‘power
Although Clapeyron did not mention Watt or the indicator diagram, oth- ers made the link explicitly
In later nineteenth-century texts the connection was routinely made
Here, for example, is Peter Guthrie Tait, the close associate and collaborator of William Th omson: ‘Besides the many capital improvements which Watt introduced into the steam engine … we owe to him what is called the Indicator Diagram, which is of the utmost importance to the elementary exposition of the fundamental principles of Th ermodynamics
Tait was care- ful to point out, however, the nature of Watts understanding of the indicator diagram as giving ‘the work done during a stroke of the engine
It was in the hands of Clapeyron and Rankine that it was developed to represent ‘the thermal properties of the working substance itself; and their connection with the laws of thermodynamics
Th e indicator gained important mention when engineers wrote about (1)(2)
One prominent and important example was the article on Watt written for the ninth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, by (1) (1) (1)(2)32 In this fi rst sub- stantial rewriting of the Britannica article on Watt since 1824, Ewing has this to say of the indicator: One more item in the list of Watts contribution to the development of the steam- engine is too important to be passed without mention: the indicator, which draws a diagram of the relation of the steams pressure to its volume as the stroke proceeds, was fi rst used by Boulton and Watt to measure the work done by their engines, and so to give a basis on which the charges levied from their customers were adjusted
It would be diffi  cult to exaggerate the part which this simple little instrument has played in the evolution of the steam-engine
Th e eminently philosophic notion of an indicator diagram is fundamental in the theory of thermodynamics; the instrument itself is to the steam-engineer what the stethoscope is to the physician, and more, for with it he not only diagnoses the ailments of a faulty machine, whether in one or another of its organs, but gauges its power in health
By describing the indicator diagram as a ‘philosophic notion, Ewing associ- ates Watt with philosophic insight of a thermodynamic kind
Even though he acknowledges the practical purpose of the device for Boulton and Watt, there is no sense that Watts understanding of the device was a radically diff erent one from that within thermodynamics
Not all engineers readily granted the stetho- scope analogy that Ewing accepts here
Rankine, for example, in his Manual of the Steam Engine, makes no use of the analogy since he was determined, in line with his beliefs about the intersection of theory and practice, to analyse scientifi - cally what others might accept as the tacit elements of indicator practice
Why ‘Telescoping the History of the Indicator is a Bad Idea William Henry Preece gave another, particularly interesting, retrospective account of the indicator in his Watt Anniversary lecture of 1897, which was titled ‘Watt and the Measurement of Power
Preece claimed that the indicator was Watts ‘greatest invention because it had been ‘most prolifi c in exciting fur- ther improvements in the steam-engine and because it had supplied the engineer with a ‘new sense
Preece, too, echoed the refrain that the indicator was to the engineer what the stethoscope and thermometer were to the physician because it gave an insight into the internal workings of the engine
Crucially, he was also of the opinion that ‘few instruments have been found to require less modifi cation and that Watts conception and development of it showed that he was ‘a long way before his time in grasping the doctrine of energy
Preece displayed to his audi- ence what he claimed to be Watts ‘original instrument, which he declared to be 112 years old, thus dating it to 1785
He placed this alongside the most recent form of indicator to illustrate their essential similarities and reinforce the point about the virtual completeness of the original device, and thereby support the claim about Watts prescience
Preece linked the origins of Watts indicator to his development of expansive working, and specifi cally to the famous graphical presentation in the 1782 patent
He considered that it was this way of represent- ing what was going on in the cylinder (Preece says ‘the work done in it) that led Watt to the idea of recording those happenings automatically
Preece remarked on Watts prescience, considering him ‘before his time in the use of graphics, and in the conception of the principle of energy and thus associated Watts indicator not only with the concept of ‘work but also that of ‘energy
At another stage, when discussing the ‘grand principle of the conservation of energy, he noted that energy is present in a form either useful or useless to man and that the engi- neers skill is to render useful that which is useless
Watt more than anyone else, he believed, had helped the engineer to do this
Preece had borrowed Watts ‘original instrument from Mr George Tangye of (1)(2) Th e diagram of it given in Preeces printed lecture shows ‘1785 inscribed on the main indicator barrel, hence the claim that the instrument was 112 years old
Comparison of the diagram in Preeces paper with the indicator currently held by the Th inktank in Birmingham (see Figure 6
) shows them to be structurally identical
In fact, a close inspection of that instrument reveals a very faint inscription of ‘1785 upon the barrel
Th is shows with reasonable certainty that it is the actual instrument displayed by (1)(2) Th is is made even more likely when we learn that the instrument in the Th inktank came from Birmingham Central Library, which had acquired it, along with the Boulton Figure 6

Tangye himself had bought that Collection in the sale of the Soho Foundry in 1895, which was advertised as including not only the foundry and its machinery but also ‘a unique collection of original drawings and atmospheric, sun, planet, and early crank engines, original letters of Bolton and Watt, Telford, Rennie, Arkwright and others, numerous models &c, dating from 1760, of exceptional interest to the engineering world
Th e indicator that interests us would have been among this material
Th e works were sold in one lot on 21 May 1895
So this chain of events would indeed place the ‘Th inktank indicator in Tangyes hands in 1897 when he lent it to Preece to display at the Watt Anniversary Lecture
Th e problem with all this is that the indicator that Preece displayed as Watts ‘original device of 1785 is in fact a later model, dating most likely from the 1820s-1840s
An indicator of this design was certainly not extant in 1785 since the fi rst recording indicator dates from the mid-1790s
Preeces erroneous tel- escoping of the diff erences between nineteenth-century indicators and Watts original instrument acted to support his contentions about Watts theoretical prescience
Revealing the historical problems with Preeces account of the provenance of the instrument, accordingly, renders those contentions problem- atic
More generally, it may well have been the case that there was widespread ignorance about the history of the indicator in the later nineteenth century that, in similar fashion, brought Watts ‘original indicator, and therefore the man himself, closer than was warranted to the indicators known and used by the thermodynamicists
We can grant that there were substantial continuities in a physical sense between the indicator diagram as developed and used by Watt and his associ- ates and those who placed similar inscriptions at the centre of their work on the motive power of heat within thermodynamics
But what was the conception of the working of the steam engine that lay behind the indicator diagram for Watt
Given that the ‘indicator diagram evidently plots the continuous variation of pressure in the cylinder during the engines cycle, it seems natural to assimilate it to later understandings
Although Watts and Southerns understanding of the device was less fully theorized than that of later investigators, surely the same thing was being measured
In fact, the answer to that question has to be ‘no
Th e philosopher Davis Baird has already noted the reason for this
Ulti- mately Baird has a very diff erent purpose from mine for examining the Indicator Diagram, namely to demonstrate the supposed autonomy of the indicator as an instrument across transformations in the theoretical understanding of what it measures: What is crucial is that the Indicator displays a phenomenon irrespective of the the- ories available for understanding that phenomenon
Th is allowed the Indicator to survive the theoretical ignorance of its birth and promote the theoretical advance we now associate with it … Th eories come and go but a new instrumentally-created phenomenon endures
Sometimes such an enduring phenomenon can promote theo- retical progress as well
In pursuit of this account of what he calls ‘Th ing Knowledge (about which I have some serious doubts) Baird does, however, present a rather useful descrip- tion of what he designates (less usefully) as the ‘theoretical ignorance that Watt and Southern brought to the Indicator Diagram, that is, their understanding of what it measured
As we have seen a number of times already, in his articles on ‘Steam and the ‘Steam Engine in the 1797, third, edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Watts close friend John Robison wrote about steam in terms that were still sig- nifi cantly faithful to the original ideas with which Black and Watt had worked
Reading those articles is to see an earlier cosmology preserved as if in amber
Robison depicted steam as a compound of water with latent heat
Writing about a steam bubble formed in boiling water, he stated: Observe, that during its passage up through the water, it is not changed or condensed; for the surrounding water is already so hot that the sensible or uncombined heat in it, is in equilibrio with that in the vapour, and therefore it [the surrounding water] is not disposed to absorb any of that heat which is combined as an ingredient of this vapour, and gives it its elasticity
So the source of the elasticity of steam is the latent heat
It is the elasticity of steam that enables steam to produce motion by moving a piston to expand the space that it occupies
Th us, if it were possible to increase the latent heat contained in the steam then more motive power would be available
Robison discusses how pressure aff ects the boiling point of water and therefore the relative content of latent and sensible heat in the steam produced
Davis Baird notices the signifi - cance of the fact that then Robison discusses, in the Britannica article, a device known as a ‘pulse glass
Th is is an evacuated vessel containing water or some other substance in which the liquid boils and condenses at temperatures very close to room temperature
(Th is phenomenon is the basis for novelty ‘drinking birds and the like)
In the later republication of Robisons article incorporating annotations by Watt himself, Watt made a revealing comment at the point where Robison discussed the pulse glass
Watt inserted a footnote which read: ‘Th e invention of the pulse glass is ascribed to (1)(2) Franklin, its date uncertain, prob- ably subsequent to my improvement of the Steam Engine, at least certainly not known to me at that time
Why does Watt bother to make this statement
As Baird argues, the only reason why Watt would assert that he was ignorant of the pulse glass at the time of his steam-engine improvements would be because he believed that the phenomena that the pulse glass illustrated were relevant to the innovation
Otherwise the denial was unnecessary
Th is strongly suggests that Watt did believe that waters property of boiling at lower temperatures when at lower pressures was relevant
It was because he believed that the relative pro- portions of latent and sensible heat in steam aff ected its elasticity and therefore determined how much motive power the steam could produce in the engine
Watt and Robison understood the Indicator on this basis
It was originally developed in order to track the details of pressure changes in the cylinder, pres- sure changes that they believed aff ected the relative proportions of latent and sensible heat in the steam and therefore its motive power
In another explanatory footnote to Robisons article Watt further described the Indicator as designed to ‘show nearly the degree of exhaustion in the cylinder at all periods
It is impor- tant to register that Watt says nothing here about the use of the indicator to determine the work produced by the engine
Th e focus on the degree of exhaus- tion of the cylinder is symptomatic of Watts concern with the way that pressure aff ected the constitution of the steam, especially the relative amounts of latent and sensible heat within it
It seems likely that over the years Watt had two uses for the indicator, one as an indicator of the elasticity of the steam and the other, later, use as a measure of the work that an engine was performing
Early model indicators in which a pointer simply indicated the pressure of the steam refl ected the earlier use
To see this we need to examine in a little detail the early evolution of the indicator
Th e earliest, and I think so far unnoticed, record of an attempt by Watt to diagnose experimentally the chemical state of the steam inside a ‘working engine is contained in an eyewitness report by Henry (1)(2) In early August
Cavendish and his assistant Charles Blagden visited the Soho works of Boulton & Watt at (1)(2) Th ey were shown Watts latest experiments on the steam engine, and Cavendish recorded the experience: (1)(2) Watt mentioned, that having found that some steam is condensed in the cylinder of the Steam engine, tho surrounded with steam, he made an experiment to discover what happened
He threw steam into a Glass vessel close at the top (By making it communicate with that part of the cylinder of this fi re engine in which there is alter- nately Steam and Vacuum) and found that upon making the Vacuum some of the steam condensed on the sides of the Glass Vessel; and having heated the sides of this Vessel, so that none could condense upon them, he observed the condensation take place, so as to render the Steam visible in the middle of the Glass vessel … a cloud began to appear at each Vacuum…
Th e device described by Cavendish is not an indicator in the sense of recording a value or series of values
It was, rather, a way to inspect directly what was going on in the cylinder as the engine went through its cycle
Using this device made available to the experienced eye a sense of the internal workings of the cylinder whilst the engine was in operation
Had Watt been asked to describe what he saw, the account forthcoming would have been in terms of the variable latent heat of the steam
We might call this very fi rst indicator (if such it is) a ‘visual indicator because of its reliance on direct inspection of the state of the steam in the cylinder
It deserves to be designated as an indicator, I think, because of the objective involved in its use, and also because it embodies the idea of attaching a device to an engine which ‘communicates with the cylinder in order to represent in microcosm, as it were, conditions within it
Th e fi rst devices to use a surrogate signal to substitute for direct viewing of the steam were simple barometers in which the variation of the level of the mercury indicated the pressure
Th is sort of barometer had been used to deter- mine pressure in the condenser, but did not work very well for the cylinder
Watt later stated that ‘Th e barometer being adapted only to ascertain the degree of exhaustion in the condenser where its variations were small, the vibrations of the mercury rendered it very diffi  cult, if not impracticable, to ascertain the state of exhaustion of the cylinder at the diff erent periods of the stroke of the engine
Th e device usually identifi ed as the fi rst indicator was a pressure gauge attached to the engine cylinder
It consisted of a small cylinder containing a piston con- trolled by a spiral spring
In this instrument, a pointer was attached to the rod of the piston and indicated on a fi xed scale the variation of the pressure in the cylinder
By observing at the same time a reciprocating part of the engine, and noting the pressures, a measure of pressure in the engine at various points in the cycle could be obtained
Examples survive of a modifi cation of this instrument in which a long pointer was attached to the piston rod via a lever (See Figure 6
)
Th is was the instrument used for the very fi rst attempts to measure the per- formance of a working steam engine, at the Salford Cotton Mill of George Lee, beginning possibly as early as December 1793
Only at this juncture, in 1796, was the next design of the indicator – the recording indicator – developed, on the initiative of Watts assistant John (1)(2) Th is is the design with the sliding platen, and the pencil attached to the piston arm of the indicator, a design that became familiar and widespread from the 1830s
(See again Figure 6
) Th is is the instrument that produces the ‘indicator diagram and the instrument that Preece was misled into putting in Watts hands in 1785
In truth, in 1785 the visual indicator was all that Watt had
It was to require a decade of development before the recording indicator became available
Only at that stage did it become possible to conceptualize the area of the indicator diagram as a measure of the power of an engine or, more particularly, of the work done by it
Of course, that it was possible to do this at that stage does not in itself mean that it was done
By means of his early indicators (the ‘barometer, the early gauge devices, and those producing early versions of the indicator diagram), Watt was, I suggest, pursuing a ‘steam economy by trying to gauge the state of the steam
Th is would provide information, for example, about how much cold water to inject into the cylinder
Also, as Robison put it: By knowing the internal state of the cylinder in machines of very diff erent goodness, we learn the connection between that state of the steam and the performance of the machine; and it is very possible that the result of a full examination may be, that in situations where fuel is expensive, it may be proper to employ a weak steam which will expend less fuel, although less work is performed by it
Th us, although a semi-abstract identifi cation of the indicator diagram with the work performed by an engine was beginning to be made at this stage, this was still part of the practical discipline of designing and adjusting engines so as to achieve the optimum steam economy
In that sense it was closer conceptually to Watts initial attempts to diagnose by literally seeing inside the engine than it was to the nineteenth-century indicator diagram of thermodynamic principle
Indeed Richard Hills notes this in his discussion of the detailed adjustments to Th omas Houldsworths machine in 1803 using indicator diagrams: this indicator diagram shows that, with the fi nal setting of the valves, there was little expansion of the steam during the working stroke and a high terminal pressure so no fall in temperature at the end
Th is points to the engine being regarded as working by pressure and not the transformation of heat
Once again we see that for Watt at this time, still, heat was what, by chemi- cal means, gave elasticity to the steam and created the pressure that worked the engine
Th ere was no mechanical equivalent of heat here
Th e most determined modern argument that a conception of the heat engine did develop within the Watt circle was mounted by Arnold Pacey in 1974
He tried to show, as he put it, that elements of the heat engine concept ‘were present Figure 6
Th e Pointer Indicator or Pressure (1)(2) [Reproduced from (1) (1) Dickinson and (1)
Jenkins, James Watt and the Steam Engine (1927), p
] as ideas before the time of Carnot, and not only as inventions
Th e key heat engine concept that Pacey claims to fi nd is the idea that there is a fl ow of heat through the engine
Indeed, in company with Cardwell, he believes that Watts invention of the separate condenser ‘clarifi ed the idea of the fl ow of heat through the engine as an essential feature of its operation
He relies upon a close examina- tion of experiments with the indicator by the aforementioned George Lee upon his steam engine in the works of Philips and Lee at Salford, near Manchester in 1793–5 to argue that this fl ow of heat was ‘explicitly recognized by friends and associates of (1)(2)
Th is claim is built upon an interpretation of what Lee was doing in four out of a total of fi ft y-four experiments that were reported to Boulton & Watt in 1796
In those four experiments Lee ‘calculated the quantity of heat supplied to the engine and compared it with the quantity of heat given up at the con- denser
Th e quantities were found to be substantially the same, but Lee would have expected this
As Pacey states, Lee was not testing the conservation of heat but assumed it
His object in making the comparison of output and input was simply to check on the accuracy of the temperature readings
So why all the fuss
What did Lee think of all this
On the basis of evidence that he admits to be fragmentary, Pacey tries to argue that Lee saw heat fl owing through the engine and related its fl ow to the power of the engine: Conservation of heat was probably the central principle in Lees thought (as it still was for Carnot), but Lee must also have had some ideas about how heat gave rise to mechanical power
Indeed, many of his experiments seemed to indicate that the work done was proportional to the quantity of heat given up at the condenser
But why must he have had such ideas
Th ere is no evidence that he did except in the modernizing gloss that Pacey puts upon Lees fi gures by translating the pres- entation of those fi gures from, as he puts it, Lees ‘cumbersome form of words into formulae that Lee did not in fact employ
Th at Lee measured inputs and outputs of heat says nothing in itself about how he conceived of what was going on in between
Indeed, as Pacey acknowledges ‘Lee did not actually calculate power or work, but rather the “eff ective pressure”, that is the pressure diff erence across the piston
I contend that Lee did this precisely because his idea of how the engine worked had nothing to do with the conversion of heat into mechani- cal power in the modern sense
Rather, like Watt, he probably conceived of heat combining with water to give elasticity to the steam and so create pressure on the piston
Hills, as we saw above, makes exactly this point about the concep- tions guiding the indicator experiments at Houldworths Mill in 1803, when he concludes that the experiments betrayed the fact that the engine was ‘regarded as working by pressure rather than by the transformation of heat
Pacey seems intent upon putting words in Lees mouth and ideas into his head: ‘It must have seemed very clear that there was some kind of fi xed rela- tionship between heat or temperature and power; but Lee did not try to defi ne it, Pacey states
Similar acts of ventriloquism appear in Paceys discussion of related work by Lees and Watts friend Peter (1)(2) In the early nineteenth century a number of publications discussed the relationship between mechanic power or vis viva, and the ‘force contained in gunpowder or coal
William Wol- laston argued in his Bakerian Lecture before the Royal Society in 1806 that one could be a measure of the other
Others however, were strongly critical of this idea, a writer in the Edinburgh Review [ John Playfair] contended, on the con- trary, that the work done by a steam engine must depend on the way in which the coal was burned, in particular whether it was burned quickly or slowly
Th is was an idea that Robison also expressed
It was at this stage that Ewart wrote a paper on the concept of ‘force or vis viva published a few years later in the Manchester Memoirs (1813) in which he defended Wollastons view
Pacey fi nds great signifi cance in a quotation from Ewarts paper defending (1)(2) Th e quotation is as follows: however slow or quick the combustion of the coals may be, if they be eff ectually burnt, the full quantity of heat must be given out
If the heat be allowed to escape without being communicated to the water; or if aft er being communicated to the water, the pressure of the steam be not wholly applied in producing the intended eff ect, the loss must be owing to practical imperfections in the construction of the apparatus … But although the whole heat, or the whole force, can in practice never be completely transferred from one given object to another, yet there can be no doubt of the real existence of both heat and the force in their full quantities…
Of this, Pacey says: Th e idea behind this seems to be of a quantity of heat being transferred from burning coal to the boiler, and then through the engine to the condenser, while at the same time there is a parallel generation of pressure and transfer of ‘force from the cylinder to the machines being driven
Th e transfer of ‘force must bear a fi xed relationship to a particular fl ow of heat – but no statement by any British experimenter at this time sheds any more light on the problem
Th is interpretation of what Ewart is saying is not the only possible one
I see no reason, for example, why the interpretation could not be couched in terms of the chemical combination of heat with water to produce steam
Pacey fi nds ‘the most disappointing feature of the episode to be that ‘Lee and his friends seem to have made very few explicit comments about the signifi cance of the experi- ments or about the ideas to which they gave rise
Perhaps their failure to do this resulted from the fact that they saw nothing new or startling in them
Why should we be disappointed at their failure to have more modern ideas
Pacey, however, continues to seek, and claims to fi nd, evidence that Lee was averse to theorizing, an attitude that might explain his failure to discuss the right things
Writing to James Lawson, a Boulton & Watt employee, Lee gave his response to Pronys second volume of his Nouvelle Architecture Hydraulique saying that he was ‘all out of patience with Prony … such a parade of Algebraical Formulae and total want of Candour and Justice to (1)(2) Watt, and a complete Ignorance of the physical properties of Steam
Pacey takes this to mean that Lee was an empiricist, averse to theory, and he diagnoses him as having ‘a weak- ness in ‘not seeing the need for clear principles and general concepts on which a theory of steam engines could be built
On the contrary Lees words might reasonably be taken to mean that he was happy with Watts account of the physi- cal properties of steam
On these grounds, I see no compelling reason at all for Paceys overall conclusion that ‘the science of thermodynamics has deeper roots in the eighteenth century than historians of the subject have so far acknowl- edged
If it does have such deeper roots, I dont see them as passing through Watt and his immediate circle
It is certainly true, as I argued in Chapter 2, that Watt and his associates were revising some of their conceptions in the early nine- teenth century but this was done by way of proofi ng Watts claims to philosophic engineering fame against uncertain shift s in the science of heat rather than as an exercise in prescience about thermodynamics
Norton Wise and other scholars have shown us that indicator diagrams came to have a protean quality in the nineteenth century
Not only have they been seen as crucial to representations within thermodynamics but also modifi cations of them have been traced in physiology (graphs of muscle and nerve action) and even in the supply and demand curves of political economy
Th ere is no doubt that these connections are real
However, it is also true that they are not continu- ous or ‘natural
Th ey involved Helmholtz and Fleeming Jenkin in considerable hard work to make them
Wise puts it this way in the case of Helmholtz: Conceptually speaking, Helmholtzs adaptation of engine indicators to physiological motive forces is extremely simple
Th ey are of particular interest because they move across immense diff erence in pressure and time scales
It is easy enough to say that the work of engines replaces that of muscles and therefore both should be subject to the same kind of analysis
It is quite another to compare a fi ft y-horsepower engine running at fi ft een revolutions per minute with a frog muscle developing a few ergs of energy almost instantaneously
Part of Helmholtzs genius, as Olesko and Holmes describe it, lay in his ability to design the extraordinarily sensitive mechanisms that could realize the conceptual analogy, rendering it quite precise in terms of the time development of the muscles energy
Th e point I want to extract from this is that whilst the analogy that moved the indicator diagram from one forum to another was (perhaps) conceptually sim- ple, its realization was complex
In the end it was the intercalation of the theory and detailed practices that sustained the analogical transposition
In exploring analogical moves between thermodynamics/engine practice and physiology or political economy, the ‘gap to be bridged is obvious
It is less obvious, but no less real, I suggest, in the matter of analogical moves between Watts use and understanding of indicator diagrams and their use by the likes of Clapeyron and (1)(2) Th is was what Tait gestured towards when he compared Watts practi- cal understanding of the indicator diagram with the ‘higher level to which the thermodynamicists took it
Not only this, I have argued, Watts practical under- standing was underwritten by a theoretical formulation completely alien to the nineteenth century
Th us those accounts of the Indicator Diagram that assimilate Watts use of it to its later conceptualization as a measure of work or energy in mid-nineteenth- century thermodynamics are misleading
Th ey read Watts understanding of the steam engine and the indicator diagram through the historical fog of both the chemical and the thermodynamic revolutions
– 169 – 7 CONCLUSIONS James Watt was certainly a ‘man o pairts, but he was also a coherent whole
For too long our historical understanding of him has emphasized the many parts, seeing the whole only dimly, if at all
By pursuing the links between his practical and theoretical work I have tried to set this to rights
Watt was an engineer
He was certainly an expert, as (1) (1) Forbes put it in his discussions of these ques- tions, at contrivance
Forbes admired Watts invention of the parallel motion as showing Watts genius for contrivance, but he argued that this in itself would never have been the basis for ‘reputation
Watts reputation derived from his quality as a philosophic engineer
I have argued that what gave his engineering its philosophic quality or dimension was largely chemical in character
Watt was a chemist, whose chemistry of heat provided the philosophical dimension to his engineering
Th at philosophical dimension was very diff erent from the equivalent dimension of what became known in the mid-nineteenth century as ‘engineering science
In engineering science heat was understood as a form of energy, convertible into other forms according to the fundamental laws of ther- modynamics
All this was foreign to the intellectual world that Watt inhabited
However, because Watt was adopted as an icon and founding father of their fi eld, the engineering scientists of the nineteenth century were not averse to smooth- ing over some of the diff erences between his world and theirs
Watt the chemist and engineer became Watt the mechanical engineer
In my early chapters I showed how popular representation of Watt, which became a minor industry itself in the nineteenth century, presented the mechan- ical (1)(2) Th is was a natural and easy thing to do given the association of Watt in the popular mind with contrivance
Th e products of that genius for contrivance, or so it seemed, were everywhere in Victorian Britain, the engines, the link- age and control mechanisms to convert the power of those engines into useful work, the indicators designed to monitor, measure and adjust their performance
Whether as the geometer of Chantreys statues, reordering mechanical space to institute the separate condenser, or as the bearer of devices, conceived as the product of a craft smans skill, in later nineteenth-century statues, the mechanical Watt was carved in stone and cast in brass to sit in Westminster, Glasgow, Edin- burgh, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and (1)(2) Th e indicator that the Watt statue installed in Greenock in the early twentieth century grasped trium- phantly in its hand was recognized by those who could recognize it at all either as the stethoscope of the practical working engineer or as the device which pro- duced the ‘indicator diagram that bridged the technological marvels of steam power and the scientifi c mysteries of thermodynamics
Here, too, Watt the great mechanician was celebrated
Th e other ubiquitous image of Watt, one broadcast far and wide by the steam press and new methods of pictorial reproduction developed in the nineteenth century, was the young Watt and the kettle
Th ese images and stories appealed to the idea of youthful genius prefi guring mature accomplishment
Usually the import of the image was nothing more than that
Exactly what was prefi gured was rarely of too much concern
Th e standard presumption was that the young Watt was realizing the power of steam, noticing the fact that steam might be a source of mechanical action
Sometimes the young Watt was seen as contem- plating the properties of steam, notably its condensability
But so far as those properties were understood at all by nineteenth-century audiences they were understood in terms of thermal laws – the physics of heat
So this aspect of Watt iconography also tended to reinforce the image of the mechanical (1)(2)
In textual treatments, the character and status of Watts achievement was much debated
I have shown that in the late eighteenth century a close connec- tion between Watts chemistry and his engineering accomplishments could be contemplated
In fact Watt broadcast such a connection, as did others
However, in the nineteenth century that connection was unravelled
Th e central fact behind the unravelling was the victory of Lavoisian chemistry and the rapid perception of phlogistic chemistry as archaic and misguided
Given this fact, Watts undoubted engineering achievements and his status as a profound engineer could not com- fortably, or reasonably, be connected to his archaic chemical understandings
Th is separation of Watts chemistry and his engineering was pushed along in a number of ways
One was through Watts self-fashioning in the early years of the nineteenth century
Th e scientifi c respectability of Watts steam experiments, the basis for his already strong reputation as a philosophical engineer, was threatened by the rapidly shift ing understandings of heat and the experiments of others
In such a situation the fact of the experiments having been done, and done by Watt as distinct from Joseph Black, had to be publicized
But the substance of them had to be adjusted to the modern idiom, their chemical character being de-emphasized
Th e account of the experiments fi nally published in Watts notes on Robisons essays on ‘Steam and on the ‘Steam Engine in 1822 was, I have suggested, a result of this process
Watts chemical understanding of heat was assimilated to the ther- mal laws explored by early nineteenth century investigators
Another episode acting to alienate chemistry and engineering in Watts accomplishment was the ‘water controversy
Whereas my earlier study of that controversy emphasized the ‘battle of the icons (Cavendish and Watt) driven by their value to contrasting ideologies of science–technology relations, my con- cern here has been with its consequences for the depiction of Watt as chemist and as engineer
My conclusion is that neither side in the water controversy could give a true contextual picture of Watt as chemist
Th ose who denied Watt status as chemical discoverer in the matter of the compound nature of water actively depicted his chemistry as archaic and just plain wrong
However, they had good reasons for wanting to support Watts status as a philosophical engineer
In order to maintain both these positions, any substantive connection between Watts chemistry and his engineering (or even an appreciation of how one provided a context for the other) could not be, and was not, countenanced
For their part, Watts supporters in the controversy sought to sustain his chemical reputa- tion by not venturing at all deeply into the substance of Watts chemical ideas
Instead they provided a gloss of those ideas as essentially similar to the modern- ized chemical understandings that had been constructed for Cavendish by his supporters
What was crucial, Watts advocates argued, was not the detailed sub- stance of Watts and Cavendishs ideas – both men had approached close enough to the chemical truth about water to have a legitimate claim – but rather the priority in having those ideas and communicating them
Th ey contended that Watt deserved the palm on both grounds
By pursuing this strategy Watts sup- porters obfuscated the ways in which the chemistry of heat had informed Watts steam engine improvements
Th ey continued the work of reinterpretation and re-emphasis that Watt had begun with his construction of the ‘Plain Story of the origins of those improvements
While early Victorian chemists resisted the adoption of Watt as a hero of their fi eld, the insurgent engineers of the mid-nineteenth century embraced him wholeheartedly
In particular, the engineering elite, who were pushing the status of their fi eld under the banner of ‘engineering science found a useful symbol in the ‘Great Steamer
Not long before, the status of engineer had been very prob- lematic
In fact, I argued that Watts undoubted self-identifi cation as such was eff ectively an act of defi ance in the learned world of the late eighteenth century, an act designed to assert the status of philosophical engineer against those who saw only lowly tradesmen
As the engineering profession developed in the nineteenth century, and its major institutions and educational frameworks were established, a number of groups advocated the cause of ‘engineering science
Th e Gentlemen of Science of the British Associations early years saw ‘engineering science as a way to institute hierarchical control over engineering by physical scientists, and even by gentle- men whose liberal education included mechanical science
Th eir representations of Watt as a philosophic engineer granted his engineering profound status whilst dismissing his chemistry as superfi cial
But the Gentlemen of Science were also usually anxious to stress that Watt the autodidact had in fact relied upon Profes- sor Black, and hence upon the academic world, for some of the key ingredients that rendered his engineering philosophic and eff ective
Th e Northern philosophers, such as Th omson, Rankine and Tait, who began from mid-century to eclipse the Gentlemen of Science in control of major scien- tifi c institutions, brought a diff erent approach to their advocacy of ‘engineering science
Th ey saw a genuine unifi cation of theory and practice without the clear domination of one by the other
Th ey exemplifi ed in their own backgrounds and careers the easy and untroubled combination of the roles of engineer and natural philosopher
As Peter Bowler and Iwan Morus put it, it was not so much that they ‘regarded their researches into the science of heat as being of potential use in improving the design of steam engines but that they regarded the two enter- prises – natural philosophical investigation and technological improvement – as being two sides of the same coin
Th eir depiction of Watt tended to refl ect this attitude
Th ey, unlike the Gentlemen of Science, were comfortable with Watt as a businessman and a patentee, seeing no reason why he could not combine these roles with those of engineer and natural philosopher
Although they were, on occasion, careful to recognize Watts own intellectual context, their enthusiasm for him as a precursor who personifi ed the unity of theory and practice, some- times led to elisions that aligned Watt closely, and falsely, with energy physics and thermodynamic insight
Th e painting that I have chosen as the frontispiece of this book, ‘James Watt and the Steam Engine: Dawn of the Nineteenth Century, which was produced by James Eckford Lauder in 1855, captures marvellously the range of represen- tations of Watt that were constructed in the nineteenth century
Lauder seems to have loaded into his picture all the variety of, sometimes contending, repre- sentations of Watt that various interests were generating
We have already seen Rankines praise of this image for its inclusion of the model Newcomen engine
Some who knew nothing of that model and its supposed signifi cance had criti- cized the picture for incorporating ‘an object so unattractive
However, Rankine declared the artist right to include it because ‘that small and uncouth mass of wood and metal shines with imperishable beauty, as the earliest embodiment of the genius of James Watt
So Rankine found Lauders painting inspiring because it showed how the engineer or mechanic could, through engineering science, rise ‘to the dignity of a Sage
Th e image, however, covers a number of other possibilities
Th e papers on the desk, with dividers poised, echo Chantreys Watt as geometrician
Tools arrayed in front of the model engine speak of Watt the craft sman in a gesture of solidarity with the working engineers who found self- affi  rmation in that image of the great man
Just identifi able behind the model is, it appears, a kettle on a stove
Th e viewer can pick a favourite symbol and fi nd reinforcement in Lauders painting for the preferred characterization of (1)(2)
However, the painting, in at least one respect, is perhaps ‘loaded towards a par- ticular view
Th e positioning of the kettle, consigned as it is to the background to the point of obscurity suggests how in the nineteenth century other symbols obscured the only one likely to lead to a proper appreciation of Watts approach to the science of steam
Th e subtitle that Lauder gave to his painting – ‘Dawn of the Nineteenth Century – conveys the idea that Watts invention caused the sun to rise on a new triumphant era in human material development
To me it also symbolizes the sun setting on a truly contextual understanding of Watts intellectual world and of his achievement because of the overwhelming urge to render Watt as a symbol of then contemporary utility
Leaving ‘Representations (except my own) behind, in Part 2 I set out to try to understand the realities of Watts intellectual universe
I argued that the dominant intellectual construct through most of his scientifi c and many of his engineering activities was the chemical theory of heat that he imbibed from Cullen and Black, and that he investigated in his kettle experiments
In many respects Watt did more than Black to explore the ramifi cations of that theory
It was with him throughout his collaborations with Priestley, De Luc and Bed- does and it informed not only his steam experiments and engine improvements but also his work on water, on airs and on pneumatic medicine
In the course of tracing these developments I have tried to show that Watt was not a mere specu- lative chemist in his collaboration with Priestley but rather he conducted many experiments both in the laboratory and ‘in the large
Particularly signifi cant, I think, but as yet barely glimpsed, are the signs that Watts thinking about the chemistry of water was partially shaped by observations made of the operation of steam engines
Whether in the laboratory or erecting or testing an engine Watt was ever alert to, and anxious for, chemical understandings
Although Watt was one of the last of the phlogistians, his ideas were not unchanging
His reading as well as his laboratory experiments and his practical ventures, such as chlorine bleaching, meant that Watt routinely imported new ideas into his chemical thinking
We saw from his excursion into the debates about chemical nomenclature that he eventually adopted, and adapted, ‘oxygene as a replace- ment for De Lucs ‘humor (the principle of ‘aquosity), but did so in a way that preserved, and in his view strengthened, phlogistic chemistry
He was evidently impressed by Berthollets ideas about affi  nity and used them in his inquiries into the production and mode of action of medically useful airs
Th ere is, I think, much more to learn about the interactions of Watts practical and theoretical chemistry, but perhaps these examples point the way
In particular, I hope that future, more detailed, reconstructions of Watts chemistry in his dealings with the wider world of the British and European Republic of Letters will bear the steam engine in mind rather than shunting it onto a branch line
It is very diffi  cult for us to think about steam engines as anything other than heat engines in which the steam is merely a ‘working substance, a con- duit for the passage of heat from one body to another and its conversion into mechanical work
Yet, if we are to think like Watt about steam engines, we have to leave those ideas behind
For him, as I have repeatedly emphasized, steam was a compound of water and elementary heat, and its properties, notably its elasticity, upon which the operation of the cylinder and the viability of the separate condenser depended, derived from this compounding
Th e traditional arguments about whether Watts improvements of the steam engine depended on the concept of latent heat or not in many ways miss the point
Certainly, the specifi c heat of the cylinder and the avoidance of its repeated heating, cooling and reheating were initially more directly important to those improvements than ideas derived from latent heat
But in an important sense the heat latent in steam was a conceptual sub-stratum of all Watts thinking about the steam engine
It surfaced directly in relation to the problem of ‘back pressure and also in his experimental derivation of ‘Watts Law and conceptualization of the expansive working of engines, but it was always there
Seeing the steam engine as a chemical device is not just a matter of appre- ciating the importance of Watts chemical thinking in his routes to the engines improvement
It also requires us to consider what I have called the ‘ecology of steam
For Watts philosophical circle, the chemical theory of heat was important to the understanding of a great variety of natural phenomena, especially geological and meteorological processes
I have shown that there was considerable transposi- tion of understandings from one realm to another
Watt learned from De Lucs meteorology, while the Genevan profi ted from Watts steam experiments
Hut- ton gained much from the chemistry of calcareous materials, of airs and of steam in weaving together his ideas about the role of heat in geological processes
Ana- logical reasoning abounded as De Luc and Darwin imagined steam engines in the clouds and Hutton conceived the Earth as a heat machine incorporating pistons and spiracles (safety-valves)
We must be careful not to use the term ‘heat engine, of course, because that disguises the fact that it was the chemical compounding of heat that was important
Apart from their own intrinsic interest and value, these geological and meteorological musings were important reinforcements for, and affi  rmations of, Watts understandings of the steam engine
Th ey lent coherence to its place in an understanding of the natural order
Finally, my analysis moved to the story, and signifi cance of, the indicator and the indicator diagram
Th e tale behind the placing of this device in the right hand of Watts statue on the banks of the Clyde is certainly a tangled one
Straightening out the origins and evolution of the indicator technology is important
It shows us, for example, that Watt had begun with the idea of literally seeing inside the steam engine to gauge the state of the steam, to see the physical manifestations of variations in its chemical constitution during the course of a steam cycle
A series of devices culminated, thanks largely to the work of John Southern rather than Watt himself, in the recording indicator
Only at this stage was it possible to make semi-abstract identifi cations of the area of the indicator diagram with the work done by the engine
Th is was still a long way conceptually from the ‘dia- gram of energy of the nineteenth-century thermodynamicists
Partly because of the secrecy that surrounded it for many years the history of the indicator was oft en ‘telescoped
Th e case of (1) (1) Preeces misidentifi cation of a recording indicator as dating from 1785 shows how readily the telescoping of the material history of the indicator could create false impressions of Watts prescience as an energy physicist and proto-thermodynamicist
In all these ways, then, the story of the indicator captures much of the proc- ess whereby the mechanical Watt eclipsed the chemical Watt in the nineteenth century
Th e indicator also raises other broader theoretical and historiographi- cal issues going beyond the present study but upon which it throws some light
Th ese issues, which have to do with the whole question of the relations of sci- ence and technology, are raised by Davis Bairds notion of ‘Th ing Knowledge as applied to the case of the indicator
While Baird fi nds knowledge in things and thus collapses science and tech- nology together, I fi nd the continuous inosculation of theory and practice a more viable notion
Th e way that we conceptualize things is a crucial determinant of what they are
Th ey do not autonomously carry meanings
Of course things do in a sense ‘resist but only by virtue of making it diffi  cult for us to attach mean- ings to them
Resistance as such is not identifi able
We cannot, then, study Watt purely as an engineer or purely as a natural philosopher
Th e interaction of the scientifi c and the practical is what needs to be understood
I have refl ected this in my treatment of Watts chemistry and of his steam-engine improvements
However, this study is predicated on the assumption that it is meaningful to seek analysis of just what the ‘science that entered into the science/engineering amalgam in Watts ventures was
In Peter (1) Joness terms I treat Watt as ‘savant- fabricant but still feel entitled to ask just what kind of ‘savant he was
I also feel impelled to ask that question
Amalgams of science and practice by historical actors can profoundly mislead us about what earlier amalgams were like
Th is is why I have felt the need to prise apart the study of heat and the production of the steam engine as a preliminary to putting them back together again in a new, more contextually sensitive, form
James Watt was a chemist
He was also an engineer
We understand him, and the origins of the steam age, better if we can see him as both at the same time

It is also interesting to note that the issue of representing Watts most important improve- ments graphically was a central one in the patent trials of the 1790s, when his patent specifi cation was attacked because of its failure to include mechanical drawings of a spe- cifi c contrivance
Th at omission was a conscious one by Watt and his friends to avoid limiting the scope of the patents to a particular mechanical realization of the (chemical) principles that he sought to claim
To limit scope in that way would be to invite engine pirates to circumvent the patent by producing only slight variations in the specifi ed mechanical form
Chantreys images of Watts machinery are in this sense readable as an abstract geometrical account of basic chemical principle, at least so far as the sepa- rate condenser is concerned
But of course they were never read as such but rather as a mechanical idea of the separate condenser

http://www(1)bras(1)k/montypython/episode38(1)tm#11 Th e Presenter is introducing a  documentary on medical breakthroughs
He utters some of the truest words ever spo- ken in jest about the nature of discovery: ‘Penguins, yes, penguins
What relevance do penguins have to the furtherance of medical science
Well, strangely enough quite a lot, a major breakthrough, maybe
It was from such an unlikely beginning as an unwanted fungus accidentally growing on a sterile plate that Sir Alexander Fleming gave the world penicillin
James Watt watched an ordinary household kettle boiling and conceived the potentiality of steam power
Would Albert Einstein ever have hit upon the theory of relativity if he hadnt been clever
All these tremendous leaps forward have been taken in the dark
Would Rutherford ever have split the atom if he hadnt tried
Could Marconi have invented the radio if he hadnt by pure chance spent years working at the problem
Are these amazing breakthroughs ever achieved except by years and years of unremitting study
Of course not
What I said earlier about accidental discoveries must have been wrong
Nevertheless scientists believe that these penguins, these comic fl ightless web- footed little bastards may fi nally unwittingly help man to fathom the uncharted depths of the human mind

Th e art experts whom I have consulted at the National Portrait Gallery and the Courtauld Institute are unaware of the whereabouts of the original painting

On Stone see (1) (1) Baldry, Marcus Stone, (1) (1) His Life and Work (London: Art Journal, 1896)
Th ere are in fact two very similar engravings of Stones painting
Th e one by James Scott is shown in Figure 1(1)
Th is was declared in 1869, published by Henry Graves and Co, and reproduced by (1)(2) Herbert Bourne produced a second engraving, incorpo- rating specifi c diff erences of detail and in a less delicate style
Th is can be seen reproduced in (1) (1) Engen (ed
(1) Best), Victorian Engravings (London: (1)(2) Martins, 1975), p(1)
One interesting diff erence is that Bournes engraving does not have a sword hanging beside the Watt hearth as Scotts does
Given that the ‘action in the picture would date from the years immediately aft er 1745, and that aft er the rising the possession of arms was prohibited by the 1746 Disarming Act, for someone familiar with those aspects of Scottish history, the sword would have controversial implications concerning the poli- tics of the Watt household
It is interesting that these issues reverberated in Victorian times
I have been unable to locate the original Stone painting and do not know whether or not it included the sword
31
Th e only modern reading of this picture that I know of is by Susan Casteras, who con- fi rms that it is a depiction of young male genius
Th is was a popular genre, with a stream of paintings depicting the early lives of composers, artists, writers, painters and leaders being produced at this time
Casteras is, however, little interested in what the young Watt is up to in the painting except that he is being a youthful, male genius
See (1) (1)

(1) (1) Carrington, Th e King of the Golden River AND Letting off  (1)(2) Two Plays for Juniors (London: (1) Mathews & Marott, 1936)
At one point in the dialogue of Letting off  Steam James says: ‘Th ats funny
When the steam cant get out of the spout, it pushes up the lid
Despite its apparent reliance on the Stone painting for inspiration the play thus has Watt perceiving the power of steam rather than its properties
Th e play also refl ects the tendency of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century stories about Watt to couple invocations of his genius with accounts of his hard work
Th us in Scene Two, in an exchange between Watt as an old man and a friend, we read: ‘Friend: Youve had a wonderful career
Wonderful luck
James: Do you know how you spell the word ‘luck
Friend: l-u-c-k
James: W-O-R-K

A number of kettle pictures, which place the young Watt at the fi reside, probably derive from the anecdote conveyed here by Gibson and used by Arago in his spoken éloge

Th e documents in question had been retained by the late Lord Gibson-Watt when the bulk of the papers kept at Doldowlod House were purchased from him in June 1994 and subsequently housed in the Archives Division of Birmingham Central (1)(2) Only on Lord Gibson-Watts death did the ‘kettle documents, together with books, instruments, furniture and assorted memorabilia come up for sale

39
I am aware of two versions of the memoranda containing the kettle anecdote
Th e fi rst is that long held at Doldowlod and sold at Sothebys in 2003
It is a document sent by Miss Jane Campbell to Watt Jr in December 1834
Watt Jr annotated it with the title ‘Memoranda of the early Years of (1)(2) Watt, by his cousin, (1)(2) Marion Campbell (born Muirhead, and daughter of his Mothers sister who was his companion in Youth and inti- mate friend through life; communicated by her to her daughter Miss Jane Campbell, in 1798, who then wrote them down
Transmitted by her to J Watt in Decr(1)
Th is doc- ument is in Miss Campbells hand
My claim is that Watt Jr made the change of ‘power to ‘properties evident in it
Th e second manuscript version of the document (Muirhead Papers, Birmingham Central Library, MI/8/20, new reference MS3219/6/219) is in a third hand, probably that of someone acting as a copyist for Watt Jr at that time, with annotations by Watt Jr at the end
Watt Jr has also inscribed the date ‘22 January 1835 at the top of the document
Th is strongly suggests that it is Watt Jrs retained copy of what he sent to Arago with his letter of that date
Th is copy diff ers from the Sothebys docu- ment in several respects: (1) the title is slightly diff erent, ending ‘who was his companion in youth & friend through life; dictated to and written down by her daughter Miss Jane Campbell in 1798; (2) a sentence concerning Watts carpenters tools given to him by his father is inserted; (3) the beginning of the quotation concerning the kettle incident has Watts aunt referring to ‘James Watt, rather than ‘Jamie Watt; (4) the document refers to ‘properties of steam although from a diff erence in the quality of the writing it appears as if this copy may have initially read ‘power of steam and been modifi ed
Th ese diff erences act as markers in determining which of the two documents was used in subsequent pub- lications
It appears that the second document, as edited by Watt Jr, became the source used by Arago, Watt Jr and (1)(2)
40
Other correspondence with Jane Campbell, also part of lot 5 of the Sothebys sale, shows Watt Jr correcting related aspects of her account, notably her claim that Watt attended Blacks lectures at (1)(2) See Sothebys, Th e James Watt Sale, p(1)
Watt Jr pointed out that his father had explicitly denied this
We know that Watt Jr was a ruthless modifi er of history in the service of his fathers reputation

Musson and Robinson, Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution, Eric Robin- sons early treatment of the kettle myth as having a genuine historical basis (Robinson, ‘James Watt and the Tea Kettle) can plausibly be seen as aiding a general endorsement of Watts scientifi c status and therefore a move in these historical debates

Th ough painted many years before, James Eckford Lauder, ‘James Watt and the Steam Engine: the Dawn of the Nineteenth Century (see my fron- tispiece), has some of the fl avour about it that Dickinson sought
I argue below that Lauder was trying to be all things to all people so far as Watt symbolism was concerned
48
Perhaps Watt Jr also read the Buss painting as a depiction of his father contemplating the properties of steam
Such a reading is certainly possible even though to us it might seem more ‘natural to read it the other way

(1) Carnegie, James Watt (New York: Doubleday, Page & Co, 1905)
While Carnegie made £10,000 available he insisted that an attempt be made to raise money from small donations from around the world
To this end an elaborate structure of heads of memo- rial committees in the US, Canada and Australia as well as in Scotland/England was set up
(See (1) Caird to Carnegie, 26 August 1903, vol(1), ff (1)–18449 and 7 Sep- tember 1903, vol(1) ff (1)–18478, Andrew Carnegie Papers, Library of Congress, Washington, (1) (1)) Ten thousand circulars were distributed seeking donations, but a disappointingly small sum was raised
Carnegie sent £5,000 on behalf of ‘the American subscribers (probably most of it came from his own pocket), and subsequently brought the sum up to £10,000

It became widely agreed that by later (mid-nineteenth century) standards the Watt patent specifi cation would have been invalid because incomplete
In fact the crucial judgment in relation to James Beaumont Neilsons hot blast patent in the mid-nineteenth cen- tury established that the patenting of any one concrete method for realizing a principle eff ectively gave protection against all other methods of realizing it
Th e argumentation that supported that decision cited the Watt patent in support of Neilsons case

Th e fact that post-1800 narratives were craft ed with reference to earlier ones is, however, indicated by the fact that later statements are found in the archive collected together with earlier ones, the collection having evidently been done by Watt himself

Private narratives began much earlier
Indeed Watts famous 1765 notebook of his exper- iments (of which much more below) is in part a narrative reconstruction of Watts work
Many modern historians of science recognize that there is no clear demarcation to be made between the production and the communication of scientifi c knowledge so that primary scientifi c documents, and even laboratory notebooks, should themselves be seen as narratives presenting and constituting discovery

Th e dependence of Watt upon Black for the fact of latent heat, which is implied here, was evidence for all those later accounts that continued to portray Watt the craft sman engineer as dependent on Black the philoso- pher
35
Th e ‘Plain Story was thus evidently part of a tactic that ran counter to the description of Watts invention as a chemical one
Th ese were alternative ways of avoiding the iden- tifi cation of Watts invention as being mechanical and therefore requiring mechanical specifi cation
Watt and his counsel were, I suggest, opportunistic in moving from one to the other

Southern explained: ‘It is well known that if common air be expanded, cold is produced… if a given quantity of it at a given temperature could be gradually expanded, and as it was so expanded, gradually supplied with heat, so as to keep the tem- perature unaltered, this supply of heat would become latent; the thermometer would not show it
It is probable, both from analogy and experiment, that this eff ect takes place in the expansion of steam
It is not of this part of its heat, though latent, and, in the experi- ments above related, undistinguishable, that I would be understood to speak when I state my opinion to be as just mentioned; but it is of that which, when water alters its state to that of an elastic fl uid, becomes essential to it in every degree of elasticity, besides that which belongs to its expanded state
Th is latter may be called the latent heat of expansion, while the other may perhaps properly be called constitutional

Watt was balloted and elected 24 November 1785
‘Inventor might be thought to face some of the same status diffi  culties as ‘engineer
However many if not most inventors associated with the Royal Society were gentlemen, and there would have been no automatic connection in Fellows minds between an inventor and the taint of trade

See Watt to William Small, 24 November 1772, in Muirhead, Origin and Progress, vol

Watt recorded in his journal having written to Small that ‘in recommending me to canals &c, he should observe I would only be engineer not Manager & would have nothing to do with cash or workmen
(‘Journal of James Watt, July 1772–April 1773, Archives of Soho, MS3219/4/134, p(1)
) We must be careful, however, in pushing this perception too far
In some respects Watt was just as astute and eff ective a businessman as his partner Boulton, to whom is usually ascribed all the acumen in that department

‘Letter proposed to be addressed to Mr Prony by J Watt in the year 1803…, in Archives of Soho, MS3219/4/287/7

Maurice Crosland has pointed out to me the ‘embarrassment for my general argument (about Watt as chemist) of the fact that ‘in publications he insisted on describing himself as an engineer, and added that it was ‘surprising that he felt it necessary to describe his profession like this
It was not as if he was claiming to be a member of an elite society
(Personal communication, 16 January 2009
) My suggestion that Watt was making a point about the term ‘engineer off ers an explanation for this otherwise surprising act of self-identifi cation

William Small to Watt, [
] December 1773, extracted in Muirhead, Origin and Progress, pp(1)–2, on p(1)
Th e role of writing in Watts career was much discussed around this time
Both Small and Boulton encouraged him to either write the treatise on steam or a paper for the Philosophical (1)(2) Small thought that writing would advance Watts reputation
When combined with a trip to France it would, as he put it, raise the ‘curiosity of the English … to see the philosophical and travelled engineer, (Watt to Small, 27 October 1773 in ibid, p(1))
However, Small had earlier advised that Watt might still have to reconcile himself to ‘engineering in the vulgar manner – that is civil engineering works – to earn a living
(Small to Watt, 19 October 1771, in ibid, p(1)
) When he heard that Watt was considering going abroad, Small sought to dissuade him by holding up the prospect of a career as a consultant engineer: ‘You might live by inventing only an hour in a week for mathematical instrument makers
(Small to Watt, [
] Decem- ber 1773, ibid, p(1)
) Boulton also encouraged Watts writing, but characteristically with a steady eye on its publicity value

Here is the quotation from Macaulay: ‘Th e mathematician can easily demonstrate that a certain power, applied by means of a cer- tain lever, or of a certain system of pulleys, will suffi  ce to raise a certain weight
But his demonstration proceeds on the supposition that the machinery is such as no load will bend or break
If the engineer who has to lift  a great mass of real granite by the instrumentality of real timber and real hemp, should absolutely rely on the propositions which he fi nds in treatises on Dynamics, and should make no allowance for the imper- fection of his materials, his whole apparatus of beams, wheels, and ropes, would soon come down in ruin, and with all his geometrical skill, he would be found a far inferior builder to those painted barbarians who, though they never heard of the parallelogram of forces, managed to pile up Stonehenge

4 Watts Chemistry of Heat 1
I do not want to suggest, however, that Watts practical chemistry was always related to his theoretical ideas
Like Black and Cullen before him, whose chemical courses had come to incorporate not only scraps of chemistry relating to materia medica but also a panoply of industrially-relevant operations, Watt became an adept ‘cookbook chemist of a strongly empirical type
One of the things that those who defended Blacks unwillingness to jump to ‘System were defending against was the idea that the only legitimate chemical opera- tions were those that had been or could be integrated into a unifi ed theoretical system
Watt undoubtedly shared some of this suspicion of the tendency to system

In eighteenth-century natural philosophy the term ‘principle was deployed to designate one of the simplest forms of matter from which other substances are formed through combinations with other principles
Th e term was also used, as in Huttons case here, to refer to a source of agency

Huttons concept of ‘solar substance, developed in (1) Hut- ton, Dissertations on Diff erent Subjects in Natural Philosophy (Edinburgh: Strahan and Cadell, 1792), was a crucial cause of embarrassment for (1)(2) For Hutton, however, ‘solar substance was a central aspect of his theory, not least because it unifi ed chemical change and the phenomenon of light
An important criticism of the new chemistry in the 1790s and into the 1800s was that it failed to account for such phenomena
Th is was argued by the young Henry Brougham, surveying the chemical scene for the Edinburgh Review in the course of a review of Robisons edition of Blacks lectures: (1) Brougham, ‘Lectures on the Elements of Chemistry, Edinburgh Review, 2 (1803), pp(1)–26

Blacks lectures show that his other chemical ideas interacted very little with his chem- istry of heat as such
In many ways Blacks long-term reputation was helped by this since it made it relatively easy to prize apart his achievements into chemical discovery (e
g
of ‘fi xed air) and physical discovery (the ‘thermal laws relating to latent heat)

See (1) Golinski, Science as Public Culture: Chemistry and Enlightenment in Britain, 1760–1820 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp(1)–9
Golinski gives important insights into the way that the diff erent social contexts in which they operated gave Black and Watt rather diff erent attitudes towards, and possibilities for, the conduct of schemes to apply knowledge as ‘projectors and the claiming of priority in discovery (pp(1)–9)

Adair Crawford studied with Irvine at Glasgow and applied his teachers doctrines to animal heat
His book Experiments and Observations on Animal Heat (London: (1) Mur- ray, 1779; 2nd edn, 1788) enjoyed wide circulation and its ambiguities led to Crawford being given credit for many of Irvines ideas, and some of Blacks
Watt was incensed by this, and noted that Crawford ‘seems not to have been much disposed to do either (1)(2)
Black or (1)(2) Irvine justice
Watt believed that the only valuable parts of Crawfords volu- minous writings were those that he had purloined from Black and (1)(2) He thought that Crawfords own experiments and theories were ‘of little value, although they serve as one of the props to the French theories

As we will see, they occasionally conducted research together
De Luc partially oversaw the Continental educational tourism of James Watt (1)(2) An anecdotal, but useful account of De Luc is (1)
(1) Tunbridge, ‘Jean André De Luc, (1) (1) (1) (1727–1817), Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, 26 (1971), pp(1)–33

119
Between mid-1792 and late 1793 Beddoes published a number of works, which set out the theoretical basis for his plans to develop pneumatic medicine
Th at basis lay primarily in the notion of regulating the atmosphere, that is, adjusting (in experi- mental and clinical situations) the amount of oxygen that the breathed atmosphere contained, or at least the amount of oxygen taken in by patients
See, in particular, (1)

Whilst here Watt treats ‘infl ammable air, properly so called and ‘charcoal in a state of solution as diff erent, he elsewhere speculates that light infl ammable air (‘hydrogene) is in fact a solution of charcoal in water
133
But compare this view with that expressed in November 1794 (letter for Percival) in which Watt refers to the ‘positive powers of fi xed air in this respect
Watts account here explicitly equates solution with chemical combination

234–5 which agrees with Partington that Berthollets Eléments de lArt de la Teinture,
vols (Paris, 1791) was important in the development and application of those ideas
It appears that these ideas also became part of the currency of the debate between the phlo- gistians and anti-phlogistians
Priestley in Th e Doctrine of Phlogiston Established (1800) states: ‘I once thought with the Antiphlogistians that fi xed air was held in solution in the heavy infl ammable air, because when it is fi red together with dephlogisticated air much fi xed air is produced; but I am now satisfi ed that all the oxygen in that fi xed air comes from the dephlogisticated air with which it is fi red (p(1))

Telling Eras- mus Darwin of Gregorys departure, Watt said: ‘Gregory being gone to College, I make no experiments being only half alive
Watts illness was caused in part by worry over patent trial business, which preoccupied him in the winter of 1794–5
Gregory had gone to Glasgow (1)(2) (Watt to Darwin, 11 November 1794, Archives of Soho, MS3219/4/124

Watt to Darwin, July
1794, Archives of Soho, MS3219/4/124
In his previous letter to Darwin of 30 June, Watt had referred to the process of expelling ‘infl ammable air from red hot zinc by water, which signalled to Darwin that Watt might still be adhering to anti-Lavoisian ideas
Darwin, who had abandoned belief in phlogiston himself, inquired gently: ‘…you speak of obtaining infl ammable air from (1)(2) Do you hold the theory that the infl ammable air (Hydrogen) is extracted from the Zinc, as your expression seems [to] countenance, or do you suppose that it is from the decomposition of water according to the idea of poor Lavoisier
[Darwin to Watt, 3 July 1794, in King-Hele (ed
), Collected Letters of Darwin, p(1)]
It was in response to that inquiry that Watt declared his con- tinuing allegiance to phlogiston

Another experiment involving airs that was intended to give insight into meteorologi- cal phenomena, was made by Boulton and Watt in 1784
Th ough generally suspicious of the thirst for empty spectacle activating most ‘balloonomania, as Watt called it, he did see potential value for natural philosophical inquiry
A balloon fi lled with a mixture of common and infl ammable air was equipped with a lighted fuse and launched
Th e intention was ‘to determine whether the Growling of thunder is owing to echos or to successive explosions
Unfortunately, a loud shout from the crowd, which had assembled to see the experiment interfered with the experimenters hearing of the explosion of the balloon and the immediate aft ermath of it
(See Hills, James (1)(2) Volume 2, pp(1)–5
) Th e crowds frustration of his philosophical purpose neatly manifested the confl ict that Watt and others saw between balloons as spectacle and as instruments of philosophical inquiry

Watt to Gilbert Hamilton, 28 September 1783, Archives of Soho, MS3219/4/123, 42
I am assuming that the publication to which Watt refers here was what eventually became De Lucs Idées sur la Météorologie
22
It is not clear, for example, that in breaking the news of De Lucs theory to Hamilton Watt was also showing that the theory was new to him
But if it was new to him in
he could hardly have been explicitly rejecting it in the letters of 1779 and 1780 that Feld- mann uses to suggest that he did
Indeed those letters may simply have been referring to what Watt regarded as a standard view of things at the time
Of course, it is also true that Watts desire to give De Luc every assistance in advancing his ideas did not necessarily mean that Watt endorsed them
23
Quoted in Jankovic, Reading the Skies, p(1)

65–6
I have omitted (1)(2) King-Heles interpolation of ‘at aft er ‘as in his transcription of this letter
Th is interpolation is an understandable but I think erroneous ‘correc- tion or unnecessary amplifi cation
Th is is so because Darwins concern is with the co-variation of the size of the surface at which the steam is produced and the quantity of that steam
So throughout the letter he refers to quantity varying either ‘as the upper surface of the boiling water or ‘as the surface of the vessel in contact with the fi re
Th e location of the production of the steam (‘at
) is implicit in the covariation (‘as…)
51
Ibid, p(1)
In a jocular, but nevertheless telling, analogy in this same letter Darwin com- pared the way the strength and activity of man depended on the ‘Quantity of vital Steam rising into the Brain from his boiling Blood with the way that ‘this Animal [the steam- engine] depended on the design of the boiler
52
Watts notebook in 1765 recorded studies of the boiler of Jonathan Sissons engine: ‘…I saw no boyler so perfect… as the common tea kitchen [kettle]…
Here the fuel is always in contact with the sides of the boyler containing the water…

), Philosophy and Science in the Scottish Enlightenment (Edinburgh: John Donald Publishers, 1988), pp(1)–86
Fenby concludes that ‘the infl uence of the Scottish Enlightenment and, in particular, of Watt and Black on the development of thermodynamics was both direct and considerable (p(1))
Th e connections that he fi nds, so far as they have substance, were, I suggest, created by nineteenth century users, rather than being ‘infl uences

Even this becomes doubtful if it is true that Watts own accounts, such as the ‘Plain Story, were activated as much by the objective of creating particular impressions in contested situations as they were by giving a ‘true history
I have argued in my account of Watts ‘self-fashioning (Chapter 2 above) that they were so activated

How widely the Address was circulated, and therefore the extent to which its elisions ‘infl uenced others is diffi  cult to gauge
It does seem that Joule at least circulated it among others of his thermodynamic circle

Th e confi dence that historians oft en have in the source of this statement is misplaced
Th e statement is attributed most oft en to Lawrence Joseph Henderson, the Harvard physi- ologist, historian and sociologist
(1) (1) Conant, Science and Common Sense (London: Oxford University Press, 1951), p(1) tells us that Henderson was ‘fond of remarking that before 1850 the steam engine did more for science than science did for the steam engine
Conant was possibly the source for the quote in (1) (1) Gillispie, Th e Edge of Objectivity (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1960), p(1), where it is treated sceptically, and the admission of ‘some truth in it by (1) (1) Forbes, ‘Power to 1850, in (1)
Singer et al
(eds), A History of Technology (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1958), p
165
Web-based sources frequently date the quotation to 1917 but it does not appear in Hendersons Th e Order of Nature, published in that year
None of the attributions to Henderson that I have seen refer to an alternative printed source
(1) (1) Bernal, Science and Industry in the Nineteenth Century (London: Routledge, 1953), p(1), expresses similar sentiments
Lord Kelvin is sometimes attributed with a variant substituting ‘thermody- namics for ‘science, but the source of this I also fi nd remarkably fugitive, and I have seen it credited to (1) Willard (1)(2)

Cardwell, From Watt to Clausius, pp(1)–1 is convinced that Clapeyron had encoun- tered the indicator diagram but is not sure how
John Farey, as previously noted, had seen an indicator diagram being taken in Russia in 1819
It is possible that the same thing happened to Clapeyron on whose presence and activities in Russia at this time see (1) Bradley, ‘Franco-Russian Engineering Links: Th e Careers of Lamé and Clapeyron, 1820–1830, Annals of Science, 38 (1981), pp(1)–312

I am very grateful to Dr Jim Andrew for showing me the Th inktank indicator during a visit there in November 2007, for subsequently photographing it, for further inspect- ing it to fi nd the engraving, and also documenting its provenance
At the Cornwall Works of the Tangye family in Birmingham there was an exhibition devoted to James Watt in which the indicator was centrally displayed in a glass case
Th is is evident from a photograph of the exhibition on the ‘Digital Handsworth website (http://www(1)igital- handsworth(1)rg(1)k/)
Th e exhibition is dated to 1900– c(1), but was probably before 1911 since the artefact passed to Birmingham City Council along with the Boulton & Watt papers at that time
Th e Local Studies and History Department of Birmingham Central Library holds the original photograph
39
Th is misdating was in fact an error on Preeces part
Th e question of who inscribed the misleading date on the indicator, when they did it, and why, remains open
One pos- sibility is that this was done at the time of the sale of the instrument in 1895 and that the inscription refl ected folklore internal to the Soho Foundry in the later nineteenth century identifying the instrument as Watts ‘original

Baird, ‘Instruments, p(1)
Baird is, of course, drawing and building on recent emphasis by a number of scholars, including notably Peter Galison and Andy Pickering, upon the importance of ‘practices in science by way of critique of theory-centrism in accounts of science dynamics
See (1) Galison, Image and Logic: A Material Culture of Microphysics (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1997); A Pickering, Th e Mangle of Practice: Time, Agency and Science (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1995)
However, given that instruments cannot speak for themselves, it seems to me that the idea of ‘hard- ware-discourse couples is a better concept than ‘Th ing Knowledge in pursuing such questions

zinc, 116–17, 119by degrees came into very general use
 A waterwheel like that installed at Arkwrights Cromford mill might generate 12 horsepower but, by 1800, wheels of 80 horsepower were in use
 These developments reduced the incentive to adopt steam power
 If they wished to purchase an engine, customers need not turn just to Boulton & Watt: there were many other competing firms
 In Manchester the company of Bateman & Sherratt was acknowledged as having ‘very ingenious and able engineers who built engines that were ‘of a small size, very compact, stand in a small space, work smooth and easy, and are scarcely heard in the build- ing where erected
 As in scientific instrument making, there was room alongside the very best for those building machines that were just sufficient for the job in hand
 It is telling, then, that Manchester writer John Aikin recorded that only ‘some few [engines] are also erected in this neighbourhood by Messrs Bolton and Watts [sic]
 So, although Matthew Boulton predicted that rotative engines presented ‘a field that is boundless, this declaration did not neces - sarily transpose into orders for engines
 Out of more than 2,000 engines built in Britain by 1800, two-thirds were of the older atmospheric type, and Boulton & Watt built only one- quarter
 One of visitors abiding memories of Manchester was its ‘dark black smoaky atmosphere, the product of a growing number of chimneys, each connected to a boiler for raising steam
 Together they supplied the town with a constant fug of smoke, ‘an inky canopy which seemed to embrace and involve the entire place
 Alongside the polluted atmosphere, Manchester at street level must have been an assault on visitors senses; in 1835 Alexis de Tocqueville described ‘the crunching wheels of machinery, the shriek of steam from boilers, the regular beat of the looms, the heavy rumble of carts as ‘the noises from which you can never escape in the sombre half- light of these streets
 If the external effects of engines were the subject of negative comment, the machinery inside, by comparison, left a very favourable impression on those who saw it
 In 1786 Joseph Smith & Robert Peel of Manchester summed up the main advantage of the English cotton trade as arising ‘from our machines both for spinning and printing; by means of these we can spin both cheaper and better, and we can print >>>>>> cheaper and better
 Britain became the worlds principal textile manufacturer by solving the mechanical problems of production – and that was most evident among the whirring shafts and spinning flyers inside the mills
 A question arises, then, over who the people were to best deliver this modern, mechanical world
 A vivid description of the millwright has been provided by William (1)(2) He characterized the millwright as a ‘jack-of-all-trades, who could with equal facility work at the lathe, the anvil, or the carpenters bench >>>>>> he thus gained the character of an ingenious, roving, rollicking blade, able to turn his hand to anything
 Millwrighting was originally a peripatetic job, and millwrights, ‘like other wandering tribes >>>>>> went about the country from mill to mill, with the old song of “kettles to mend” reapplied to the more important fractures of machinery
 Fairbairn was apprenticed to the Northumberland millwright John Robinson, who maintained all the machines working at a colliery and who, perhaps because of his wide responsibilities, had a ‘rough, passionate temper and ‘indulged in >>>>>> profane swearing, carried to such an excess that an order was scarcely once given unless accompanied by an oath
 Such men, at once foul-mouthed, belligerent and highly skilled, found themselves drawn in two directions
 In these places the millwright became sub - sumed into the machine making profession alongside engineers, turners and fitters, working alongside carpenters, wheelwrights, cabinetmakers, joiners, smiths, clockmakers and others attracted from their original trades by better wages
 The millwrights particular job was to construct the shafts and wheels known as ‘mill-work, needed to couple a power source to the production machinery
 Fairbairn recalls rising with the sun in summer, and some hours before it in the winter >>>>>> For the remainder of the day I had either to draw out the work, or to ride fifteen or sixteen miles on a hired hack to consult with proprietors, take dimensions, and arrange the principle and plan on which the work was to be constructed
 Practical work was matched by skill at negotiation and draughts- manship as well
 All was underpinned by the millwrights ability to manipulate materials
 Wood began to be replaced with metal to better withstand the higher speeds at which the machinery was required to operate; bulky millwork was shrunk, the ‘ponderous masses of wood, cast iron, and their enormous bearings and couplings giving way to ‘slender rods of wrought iron and light frames or hooks for sus- pending them, [and] pulleys and straps of moderate diameters and dimensions
 So, the means of building the internal systems of a mill were provided by the millwright, using many of the techniques used to construct engines that we have earlier discussed
 As the eighteenth century progressed, and possession of a time- keeper became as much a mark of social standing as it was a record of timekeeping per se, horology was a growing trade
 These factors attracted James Watt, who took an interest in clockmaking alongside his other Thomas Allom, Swainson Birley cotton mill near Preston, Lancashire, 1834
 The machinery seen in this view, used to prepare the cotton for spinning, is driven by the belts and shafts suspended from the ceiling above
 ‘The Watch Maker, from The Book of Trades (1824)
 projects
 And even before that, in 1758, Watt was in partnership with Joseph Black and Alexander Wilson to make clocks – his workshop contains an incomplete timepiece movement and a number of unfinished clockwheels that may date from this period
 How clockmaking was organized varied across (1)(2) At one end of the scale were the makers based in (1)(2) The metropolis was home to a complex trade exporting finished clocks all over the world, comprising large numbers of specialized workers – Abraham Rees counted up to eighteen different trades – movement makers, spring makers, enamellers, brass founders and more
 In contrast to the London trade stood those making clocks who might have been trained as blacksmiths and in associated trades, build ing locks or even firearms
 These clocks were accurate timepieces but, owing to their physical size, their construction owed as much to the blacksmith as to the bench-based clockmaker
 The nature of the clocksmiths workshop reflected their combin - ation of skills
 The bench would be positioned close to the window and, if very small work was carried out there regularly, might have a groove along its front and ‘wings around the sides to catch com pon ents rolling off
 The presence of the forge is a reminder of the need to heat materials so that they could be shaped
 The plates would then be hammered flat using a round-faced planishing hammer to avoid leaving sharp indentations before hand-filing to a smooth finish: brass can be ‘work-hardened – that is, the more it is worked, with a hammer, file or in the lathe, the tougher it becomes
 The clocksmith had to carefully consider the relationship between these different materials
 Although it was less easily shaped than brass, steel was cheaper: in the early eighteenth century it might cost one penny per pound compared to ten pence for brass
 Alongside tools like hammers and files, which might be found across a variety of trades, clocksmiths were early in adopting special-purpose tools
 In a relatively small movement, these wheels were often stamped out of brass: material was removed to save weight, leaving spokes behind
 The complex processes of clockmaking produced, and attracted, self-sufficient and innovative craftsmen
 In 1741 the clockmaker Henry Hindley of York showed the engineer John Smeaton a screw-cutting lathe and a wheel-cutting machine he had constructed – both of which were later to be widely adopted in industry
 These examples show that there were extensive connections between clockmaking and larger-scale engineering, and this was widely commented upon by contemporaries
 The Manchester Mercury newspaper in the 1780s and 90s contains a series of advertisements for clockmakers to work in cotton mills and with machine makers to ‘fitt up the clock work for mules and water machines
 So, between them, clocksmiths and millwrights were capable of building complete production systems, integrating power sources, transmission systems and production machinery
 Rather than just the power source or steam engine, contemporaries were amazed at the possibility of constructing entire factories – modern, often small, but perfectly formed – that could operate with the precision of a timepiece
 This was achieved in large part using long-established materials
 For this reason we might describe the early industrial machines as examples of ‘conservative modernity, state-of-the-art new production machines, built using old-established materials and techniques by millwrights and clocksmiths
 The traditional nature of the craft skills employed in devising new production machines did not reduce their imaginative influence over those who saw them
 The mills internal mechanisms suggest the scale and complexity of some cotton manufacturing enterprises
 to the summit of the building 2,500 bushels of malt [about 38 tonnes] a day – and all this while not making ‘the least noise – not more than a clock; you might have heard a pin drop all over the building
 And in Birmingham he saw ‘enormous hammers, wielded by a steam engine >>>>>> crushing in an instant red hot iron bars, converted into thin ribbons
 Elsewhere, engines turned millstones for polishing metal ‘with so great a velocity as to come to pieces by the mere centrifugal force, and copper ‘spread into sheets for sheathing vessels under rollers >>>>>> like paste under the stick of the pastry-cook
 Improved spinning machine by Sir Richard Arkwright, 1775
 Boulton & Watt capitalized on the imaginative attraction of machines by establishing a series of showcase engine installations
 A renowned visitor to the Whitbread engine, in May 1787, was George iii
 To fully secure the companys future prosperity, one last, major matter remained to be resolved
 Watt wrote of their complaints, ‘They say it is inconvenient for the mining interest to be burdened with the payment of engine dues, just as it is inconvenient for the person who wishes to get at my purse that I should keep my breeches-pocket buttoned
 Hornblower held out to the very end: the validity of Watts patent was only finally upheld in 1799, upon which he and Boulton immediately sued for payment from all the engineers copying their separate condenser, and Cornish miners who had withheld payment for using the engine pending a legal decision
 Thus was passed a major milestone in handing over to the company to Boulton & Watts successors – their sons
 The legacy of Boulton & Watt as their partnership ended in 1800 has proved controversial
 biggest competitor
 However, up to 1800 and even beyond, the small scale of industrial enterprise, even in textiles, where powered machines ‘achieved their most famous triumphs, limited the demand for radical transformation in engineering technique
 What was needed, as this chapter has explored, could be met by adapt - ing and scaling up existing, long-established craft skills
 So a range of new oppor- tunities, including innovation in machine tools, remained open for machine making men to explore in the nineteenth century
 The road from the centre of Birmingham to Handsworth, on the citys outskirts, was pleasant and much frequented by James Watt, his family and their visitors
 And as travellers approached Boulton and Watts Soho Manufactory, Yates also noted how they passed ‘gardens, groves, and pleasure grounds that rendered Soho ‘a much-admired scene of picturesque beauty, where the sweets of solitude and retirement are to be enjoyed, as if far distant from the busy hum of men
 Fischers first port of call was the engine yard at the Soho Manufactory, and he was ‘dumbfounded at what he saw: ‘No descrip- tion could do justice to the building in which these works are housed
 He wrote that six Inventive, Creative Genius, 1795–
 In all these buildings steam engines were at work, performing their tasks ‘quietly, regularly and efficiently – a tribute to all that human ingenuity has contributed to their construction
 What is most notable about Fischers account is who was responsible for what he saw in the works
 We have also recounted briefly the legal measures taken to secure Watts patent of 1769 and underpin the prosperity of the company before 1800
 Two major technical issues affected the firm in the late 1790s
 The ironmaster John Wilkinson had made the majority of Boulton & Watts engine cylinders, but a bitter feud with his brother, and the revelation of his piracy of Boulton & Watts engine designs, brought the association to a close
 The Soho Foundry was designed from the start along rational, pre-planned lines
 As one account has styled them, the senior Boulton and Watt were builders, but their sons were organizers
 The Foundry was built around nine workshops, each dedicated to a particular process: for example, cylinder boring, turning, fitting, smithing and pattern making
 Not for nothing did Eric Roll, whose researches unearthed the details of production at Soho outlined here, claim that ‘neither [Frederick] Taylor, [Henry] Ford, nor other experts devise anything >>>>>> that cannot be discovered at Soho before 1805
 The Soho Foundry was vital to the continued success of Boulton & Watt, and it came alongside a business strategy that was markedly different from that previously adopted, and which contributed to the companys success into the nineteenth century
 As well as building beam engines, the company recognized the increasing demand for smaller, more compact and self-contained engine designs
 Equally impor- tant were marine engines to power ships at sea, and in this respect Boulton, Watt & (1)(2) worked on a number of landmark projects: the engine used by the American engineer Robert Fulton in his ship the Clermont, which heralded the opening up of North Americas great rivers by steam; the first steamship used by the Royal Navy, hms Comet; and finally the screw propeller engines for Isambard Kingdom Brunels mighty Great Eastern in 1854
 As well as new products the company also more actively sought new markets
 However, between 1795 and 1825, they built 102 – the majority after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 – and they proved to be highly profitable
 The Soho Foundry was a major landmark in the history of machine making: it was the first purpose-built factory dedicated to constructing machines
 Consequently, the Foundry received a series of extensions to provide additional workshop space in the first eight years of its existence
 By 1804 the total construction cost amounted to more than £27,000, over £850,000 at todays prices, but the whole debt had been repaid out of profits by 1812
 The young James had been intended to have a similar grounding to his father: conventional training in carpentry along with book- keeping, mathematics and the rudiments of running a business, with a view to becoming an engineer or a manufacturer
 But then, just four months into his placement, he was uprooted again to be educated in Geneva in natural philosophy, mathematics and drawing
 improvement in relations – in fact they deteriorated, and he finally quit his home, having discovered that his father did not consider him up to the job of running the engine business
 In 1791 he relocated to Manchester as apprentice with Taylor & Maxwell, a company of cotton dyers and printers, and came under the influence of Thomas Walker, an ardent republican whose views must have appealed to his latent sense of rebellion, and Watt James Watt Junior portrayed by an unknown artist, c(1)
 Junior found himself taking a leading role in the citys Literary and Philosophical Society celebrating the Revolution in (1)(2)18 By the spring of 1792 he was travelling to France, even addressing the Jacobin Club of Paris – and his activities were soon denounced in the House of Commons in (1)(2) Yet even as the younger and elder Watt traded letters arguing furiously the case for and against the French revolutionary cause, Watt Junior realized that he was in a dangerous predicament
 In England the reactionary government was sup- pressing dissent, and young Watt potentially faced charges of sedition
 If James Watt Juniors revolutionary education came to a prema - ture end, he still benefited from a further education of an affective nature
 This, it is argued, amounted to an ‘affective revolution in which people for the first time expected their emotions to have some kind of tangible expression
 Ideas were more vivid & associated together much more rapidly & so associated with words as to produce, perceptions perfectly novel
 This wasnt just a one-man project: Watt Senior designed and built the gas-making apparatus
 This is not to suggest that early engineers and machine makers were all nitrous oxide fiends and libertines, although Joshua Field recalled the 1820s ironmaster John Tickle as ‘an extraordinary character – a kind of excentric genious a Chymist & a Poet, which sounds close
 Classical influences pervaded the education that a young man like Watt Junior might receive in the late eighteenth century
 A student at Eton, for example, would attend 27 hours of teaching every week
 The influence of the antique is suggested by the schoolbooks, notebooks and reading undertaken by James Juniors half-brother, Gregory, totalling approximately 120 items, which are contained in a hair chest stored inside Watts workshop
 Among the chests contents are a Compendious Treatise of Astronomy from 1762, chemistry notebooks, lists of books and tracts to be bound, notebooks and textbooks on maths, geography, navigation, astronomy and algebra
 So, in advance of the emergence of a formal curriculum for training young engineers, their education might be both wide- ranging and disparate
 He was conscious not just of the technicalities of realizing new mechan - ical ideas, but of having to sell a product, a thing not just efficient and mechanically effective but packaged and marketed
 Boulton & Watts work on the engine happened in parallel with tremendous popular appetite for the antique – the culture, archi - tec ture and artefacts of ancient Greece and (1)(2)25 Discoveries made during archaeological excavations at Herculaneum in 1738, Pompeii in 1748 and at Paestum in Southern Italy were widely broadcast in a series of books
 Gregory Watts trunk, inside James Watts workshop
 and 1778 Giovanni Piranesi produced over 100 large, immaculately detailed and popular views of (1)(2) Rather than appealing just to scholars and antiquaries, these books descriptions and illustra- tions also became widely used source material for architects and designers, too
 They also got into the hands of Watts associates
 He also designed Boulton & Watts huge Albion Mill in London and refashioned Matthew Boultons Soho House in the Palladian style
 There is a question over how far into the ranks of Britains machine makers antique influences pervaded
 And even without a formal introduction to the classical world, the workmen in a town like Birmingham would have had an eye for what looked right
 With particular reference to those making machines, there survives a sketchbook that belonged to William Creighton, who rose from erecting engines for Boulton & Watt to become head of their drawing office in 1815, and was a highly active contributor to James Watt Juniors affective education
 Creighton noted the source that inspired each drawing, and from this information we can see that he used Wares Complete Body of Architecture, the Antiquities of Athens and Chambers Treatise on the Decorative part of Civil Architecture (first published in 1759), as well as referring to (1)(2) These, then, suggest that others beyond Boulton & Watt took inspiration from the antique
 It may be that producing work inspired by antiquity was a more accessible occupation than it might initially appear
 Rather than rigidly copying antique forms, with all the study and scholarship of the literature that would entail, Piranesi suggests progressing beyond those forms, using them as a platform for exploration and invention
 Antiquity inspired much of the output of Matthew Boultons Soho (1)(2) In 1767 the Duke of Cumberland commissioned Boulton & Fothergill to make ‘three Great Solomonean Candlesticks, each almost a metre tall, comprising fluted Corinthian columns on decorative plinths surmounted by the candleholders, themselves formed of decorative tripods
 Boulton pushed his workmen to the limit when producing such items: Josiah Wedgwood wrote that Mr Boulton was making an immense large Tripod >>>>>> to finish the top of Demosthenes Lanthorn building >>>>>> from Mr Stew- arts design
 Wedgwood obtained the work for himself by cunningly suggesting they should ‘call in some able Potter to their assistance >>>>>> Would you think it
 Although the most attention was devoted to these very expen- sive objects, made in relatively small quantities, antiquity also found its way into the output of Boultons toymakers
 Boulton employed at Soho one (1) (1) Wendler, who wrote from Naples that he had obtained a copy of Hamiltons Antiquities, comprising ‘about 456 prints in folio divided into 4 volumes [comprising] handsome Designs & patterns for the Birmingham Manu fac torys >>>>>> I am certain, that >>>>>> all our chief manufacturers >>>>>> would be very glad to have those Prints, for they may be very usefull for (1)(2)42 This would suggest a wider utility for such source material beyond Boultons works
 So, antiquity pervaded the environment in which machine- makers and manufacturers like Boulton & Watt operated
 Boulton and Watt were too old for this new fashion but their sons were not
 William Chamberss Treatise on the Decorative Part of Civil Architecture provides a springboard for exploring how they did so
 The unearthing of the temple is suggestive of engineers mining of antiquity for inspiration
 that artists should ‘study the effects that flow from those works of art ‘which by the common consent of ages are esteemed beautiful
 Gwilt believed that we construct meaning about a piece of architecture by looking at it, by striving to understand it and by devising an emotional response to it, and we can frame an analysis of machine making and engine making in these terms
 Regarding how the engine worked, Boulton & Watt had taken great care with their standardized range of machines to define the physical characteristics of each – so much so that John Farey devoted an entire chapter of his magisterial Treatise on the Steam Engine (1827) to discussing them
 For each size, the diameter of the steam cylinder, the length of stroke and number of strokes per minute of the piston, even the volume of steam expected to be consumed per minute, were all carefully defined
 The same year that Fareys book was published, Thomas Tredgold produced his own book, The Steam (1)(2) Reading both tomes together, Tredgolds is much more theoretical – as Tredgold described it himself, it is about ‘the application of science to art, and descriptions, drawings and rules of thumb are matched by complex equations and algebra
 But together, the books represent an immense quantity of knowledge about steam, codified and made available to readers
 However, the sudden expansion of publishing about steam raises an important question: Boulton & Watts partnership had ended in 1800 and since then, two decades had elapsed with no clearly formulated guides on how to make those engines beyond those materials already written by the firm of Boulton & (1)(2) Tredgold claimed in 1827 that ‘the effects that may be obtained by engines of different species, have now been reduced for the first time, to definite measures, and their proportions referred to scientific principles
 So the question is: what was the received wisdom underpinning engine building in the critical two decades after 1800
 As a first step, we return to the influence of antiquity
 Each of these components in turn resolved into tiny details: ovolos, astragals, fillets, larmiers, ogees, reglets and annulets, each contributing its mite to the appearance of the whole
 It is tempting to suggest that here was a system ready-made to be appropriated when designing engines
 Tellingly the pair were in exactly the proportions required by the Tuscan order
 However, these are just two examples out of hundreds where there was no precise association with the classical orders
 We must not forget that as understanding of its internal work- ings grew, the engine was increasingly perceived not as a static structure, but as one subject to dynamic stresses and strains, which would change continuously as it worked
 The former, necessary to safely and economically ease the flow of steam around the engine, was not an issue that Boulton & Watts forebears in antiquity had to consider, but it played a decisive role in engine design alongside the latter
 This is not to entirely discount the influence of antiquity on engineering design
 The maker of this small beam engine, c(1), is unknown, but its excellent design includes many classical design motifs, including finely detailed columns
 Later James Nasmyth wrote that ‘viewing abstractedly the forms of the various details of which every machine is composed, we shall find that they consist of certain combinations of six geometrical figures, namely, the line, the plane, the circle, the cylinder, the cone, and the sphere
 But if the precise nature of antiquitys influence is hard to quantify, what other factors influenced engineerings evolution after 1800
 First and foremost, Boulton and Watt continued to wield consid er  able moral influence, even though they were personally no longer involved in building engines
 Even Thomas Tredgold, one of Watts critics, wrote: An almost innumerable quantity of schemes for improvements on the steam engine have been crowded on the public eye within the last ten years, but except a few for improvements in construction, of small importance, there has been nothing done that is worthy of detaining the reader to notice
 As late as 1868, John Bourne was still publishing Watts rules of thumb for engine making – for determining the thickness of the connecting rod, the diameters of shafts and the size of beams, for instance – alongside more recent theories
 How far engineers actually stuck to Boulton and Watts plans is questionable
 to one, the changes having no regularity >>>>>> Equally irregular are Maudslays proportions but approaching to 2 to 1; Fenton, Murray, and Woods about as 2 1/2 is to 1
 The occasional effects of these disparate approaches were seen by William Creighton in Glasgow, where he wrote in April 1803 of having ‘visited several of the engines here >>>>>> they are as usual dirty and from the insufficiency of thin framing & construction of the frames are all distorted
 This last quote gives us a way out of this impasse: Boulton & Watt set the benchmark for how the engine performed
 Not all engineers were single-minded, deadly rational beings like (1)(2) As may be surmised from the preceding debate, there was a tremendous range of opinion on the nature of engine making
 For the first time, after all, they were as much concerned with the outward appearance of the engine as with its internal workings
 As we left the engine, being built on a new standardized scheme at the Soho Foundry, it was very much a functional machine, accu- rately built but with little conscious thought given to its outward appearance
 Engines built by Henry Harvey at Hayle, for example, were ‘more like orna- ments for a show-room than machines for draining a mine
 Rather than the traditional division between process and product, what we have here is the process as product
 From the 1790s cast iron was being employed in greater quan- tities, and the means of shaping it offered new aesthetic possibilities
 This was a defining moment in the engines transformation, giving it ‘a grace of motion not hitherto perceived
 All this work depended on improved pattern making and foundry work
 The foundryman had to avoid air bubbles in castings and sought to ensure toughness by carefully cooling the finished product over a long period(1) This degree of care and precision beyond what had been done before made possible Samuel Cleggs contention that with cast-iron construction, ‘It does not cost one farthing more to construct an elegant figure, than it does to create a deformity
 The potential of cast iron for multiplying decorative details in machinery was not lost on contemporary engineers, who wrestled Boulton & Watts ‘Lap beam engine, 1788
 with the question of what an aesthetic reflecting the steam engines importance, status and power should consist of
 Simi - larly Julie Wosk believed that ‘after 1830 >>>>>> designers confronted the need to create engine frames that embodied the centurys pride in technology
 First among these was the application of antiquity
 As beam engines evolved into self-contained structures from being built into a masonry engine house, columns proliferated, often fluted, with plain Doric and more ornate Ionic and Corinthian cap- itals, and supporting entablatures that included delicate moulded detail
 The aesthetic transformation of the engine was noted by contem - poraries
 What was once a confused pile of piping and cylinders has become an elegant iron building of Doric and Corinthian pillars
 This quotation leads us beyond the purely antique forms towards other influences that came to bear for relatively short but intense periods
: the Henry Ford Museum has an outstanding engine by New Yorks Novelty Ironworks dated from 1855, which would not look out of place working in a cathedral
 Gothic forms were supplemented by an Egyptian revival in mechanical form
 Inside Benjamin Hick of Bolton constructed a powerful twin beam engine which repeated many of the Egyptian details from outside, down to the ‘chronometric governor, a name evoking the capabilities of its builders, in the form of a winged scarab beetle
 If these startling reinventions of long-established designs suggest discontinuity, they are balanced by strong elements of stabi - lity and continuum
 of their prior knowledge, which was as much cultural as technical
 This approach is best conveyed, not by Boulton & Watt in Birmingham, or even Murray in Leeds, but by the engineers of London and, particularly, Henry (1)(2) Maudslays works, just off Westminster Bridge Road and across the river from Whitehall, have been alluded to already: they were founded in 1798 and became a hothouse for engineering talent
 Nasmyth recalled Maudslays maxims for machine design: ‘First, get a clear notion of what you desire to accomplish, ‘keep a sharp lookout upon your materials; get rid of every pound Model Hick double beam engine in the Egyptian style, 1840, and displayed at the Great Exhibition of 1851
 of material you can do without, ‘avoid complexities, and make every- thing as simple as possible – or, as the historian James Hamilton has put it, understanding, economy, simplicity
 The machines paid ‘the most scrupulous attention to accuracy and durability >>>>>> presenting an elegant pro- portion in their form, which is very agreeable to the eye, and set new standards in metal construction: economy in the use of metal, the replacement of solid forms with carefully formed bracing and restrained use of decorative details like plain columns and finials
 This approach was carried through to the machine tools Maudslay built for his London works, and in turn influenced those who trained there
 Here, then, was the start of a new machine aesthetic which had its own character
 With ‘strength in the proper place, stability without unnec - essary weight, and simplicity of form without meanness, further ornament was unnecessary, ‘because their own proportions [would] constitute their greatest
 After 1800, two competing pressures shaped how this new approach evolved
 As they did so, these engineers were ‘exhilarated and enthused about the beauty of their own creations, about whose formal qualities and the newness of these qualities they were quite clear in their minds
 Remnants of old forms began to disappear, and the new approach, ‘equally remarkable for elegance of appearance and compactness of arrangement, gained ground
 This is not to characterize the new way of designing machines as a complete break with the past: in its details, it was not
 In fact, Maudslays ‘table steam engine, a compact machine patented in 1807, was criticized as being ‘a little too complex >>>>>> its frame reminds one of an antiquated style of cabinet work
 and decoration tipped firmly to the latter: decorative ‘bun feet, spiral knurled columns, condenser cisterns or boiler casings sur- rounded by brass sheet decorated with patterns, flowers or leaves, even construction in silver
 This vernacular style emphasized engineers personal motivations and interests, not formal design protocols
 Some nineteenth-century commentators would take a dim view of this approach
 But Clegg in his turn had critics: some of his examples of tasteful engineering design were dismissed by the editor of the Civil Engineer and Architects Journal as ‘architectural monstrosities that were ‘vapid and quakerlike
 In treating the output of the early nineteenth-century engineers as art, then, we can see that its substance, and its virtues or defects, were both varied and contested
 The antique continued to hold sway into the 1840s but, in the United Kingdom at least, it was increasingly surpassed by the new functional approach
 Regardless of how it was attained, however, the period until the 1840s was unrivalled in its pursuit of beauty in engineering
 Maudslays epitaph, fittingly cast into an iron tombstone, remarked on his com- bination of ‘mathematical accuracy and beauty of construction (my emphasis)
 When Hans Casper Escher visited Manchester in 1814, he wrote that ‘One must admire the steam engines here
 Sir George Head wrote of the engine supplying air blast to iron furnaces at the Low Moor Iron Works, ‘I have listened to a storm on the Atlantic, I have stood on the Table Rock at Niagara, yet never did I hear a sound in nature equal to this – so terrific, or of so stunning a din
 The emergence of the engine as a carefully styled object reflects its role as symbol of the new industrial age, signalling dignity, pros- perity and status as much as technical mastery
 This approach was entirely congruent with how the antique was appropriated and imitated in other industries, comprising ‘an evocation of objects in other forms, and indeed the new form might well surpass the original in inventiveness
 With the future of the engine-building company in safe hands, his father was about to embark on one last, big project: sculpture copying
 The staircase up to the second floor of James Watts house, Heathfield, was steep and dark
 This was James Watts workshop
 The workshop was in the attic of Heathfield, commissioned by Watt from the architect James Wyatt in 1789 for a site on Handsworth Heath, a mile and a half northwest from the centre of (1)(2) Watt and his family moved in during September 1790
 Heathfield would be Watts home as he withdrew from the steam-engine business, and for the seven Life after Death, 1800–
 The room that Watt chose to be his workshop was at first simply a place to stow away belongings; in 1801 he sent for a quantity of possessions from Glasgow, and these duly arrived
 But the Watts workshop, as illustrated in Samuel Smiless Lives of the Engineers Boulton and Watt (1865)
 rooms solitariness was an advantage for Watts purposes: here he could pursue projects and experiments undisturbed
 The garret workshop had a dual purpose
 What the workshop was, and what it stood for, together ensured that Watt remained a commanding presence long after his death
 Watts sculpture project was not confined to his workshop but sprawled over several different parts of (1)(2) His will records that he had things stored in his study and ‘the two rooms in the South East corner of my house and >>>>>> my laboratory or elsewhere
 The children of the Pemberton family, tenants living at Heathfield in the 1860s, recalled ‘wonderful discoveries of out-of-the-way things >>>>>> discarded clay crucibles of all sorts and sizes; worn-out and queerly-shaped earthenware retorts; empty phials of all shapes and dimensions, with strange inscriptions on their labels >>>>>> in an out- building we came across two huge blocks of roughly-hewn white marble
 The two sculpture-copying machines embody Watts continuing fascination with precision manufacture
 A portfolio in the workshop contains drawings of the reducing machine in an early form, dated 1804
 Development of the machines presented Watt with several challenges
 Conversely winter also limited the progress achieved, with Watt complaining of ‘the place having been too cold for me
 The machines built on a broader interest in sculpture, and con- nections to the sculpture trade, that reached back into the 1790s
 Pierotti came from Lucca in northwest Italy and had arrived in England at Dover in 1770 before living in Birmingham and then Edinburgh, where he was entered on the Register of Aliens on 2 December 1803
 Nothing is known about him beyond this, but we do know that con- siderable numbers of mould makers or formatori came from Lucca, itinerant makers and vendors of plaster casts
 each
 Watt evidently purchased some items from Pierotti while the latter was based in Birmingham because, alongside his catalogue, there survives in Watts workshop a bill ‘for making moulds of Plaster of Paris, marked ‘Birmingham October the 8th 1792
 And among the items in Pierottis catalogue is an entry for ‘Small heads – Proserpina
 As well as finished casts, Watt was also an avid collector of moulds for antique figures
 a figure of Atlas, complete with a globe to rest on his shoulders, which I suggest is a match for the figure of ‘Atals ordered from John Pierotti in October 1792
 Watts copying machines were, then, the culmination of a sus- tained interest in the world of sculpture that extended to purchasing moulds and taking his own copies from them
 Thomas Howard attempted to ‘transplant A three-part plaster mould of an arm from Watts collection inside his workshop
 old Greece into England through his extended pursuit of statuary
 There emerged in the eighteenth century a trade in marble copies of originals in Rome, for example, which were hugely costly on account of the time they took to make: one Italian maker had spent fourteen months on a copy, with another five months expected to finish it off
 Further demand for sculpture was driven by the Grand Tour, as the well-to-do and classically educated set out from Britain to see the antique sights of Italy, visiting Rome, Pompeii, Herculaneum and Venice, among other places
 Returning from that experience, they sought small, portable pieces of sculpture that could be displayed in their homes as symbols of wealth, knowledge and connoisseurship
 Gilbert White took this one step further at his house in Selborne, (1)(2) Unable to afford a statue for his grounds, he mounted a carefully painted wooden outline of a sculptural figure on an appropriate plinth; from a distance it could not be distinguished from a three-dimensional statue
 By the mid-eighteenth century, then, a professional trade had emerged in England, to satisfy the demand for sculpture
 But another, unique trade in cheaper statuary and statuettes, most often made in plaster, evolved in early nineteenth-century (1)(2) Rather than pieces of ‘art, the output of this trade was regarded as a commodity to be bought and sold
 How the plaster copy trade generated reproductions was a tortuous process
 The precision obtained, then, was highly variable
 This background helps contextualize Watts copying machines: he had an interest in sculpture of some long standing, there was a widely held appetite for sculpture in materials ranging from marble to plaster, and low-quality copies offered the potential for improve- ment
 The technical challenge and financial rewards of making high-quality copies of sculpture was one that Watt, and others like him, could not resist
 What is notable about all these machines is the length of time after Watts that they were made
 The mechanism was driven by an ingenious flexible drive and could pivot around a ball joint, creating a larger range of movement compared to Watts machines
 composer, poet, preacher and phrenologist whose father had been a clockmaker
 Thomas Jefferson purchased two to keep up his voluminous correspondence and declared it ‘one of the greatest inventions of this age
 With his experience of turning either a three-dimensional shape or a two-dimensional letter into a two-dimensional image (as with his physiognotrace and polygraph respectively), it was a logical next step for Hawkins to experiment with turning a three-dimensional original into a three-dimensional copy – as in sculpture copying – and that is exactly what he did
 This gentleman offered to take out a joint patent with Mr Watt; but he had suffered so much from former patents, that he was unwilling to embark in any new concern
 That neighbour was (1)(2) There are no letters between Hawkins and Watt in the latters correspondence, and the details of any meeting are lost
 Watt, getting old, and confronted by the young, energetic Hawkins, may have felt discouraged
 Whatever happened, Watts sculpture-copying machines were the first of a new generation of machines constructed to the same end
 A prime demonstration of this is provided by Watt, who conscientiously noted the time taken for each of the processes needed to make a single bust of Sappho in January 1811: a total of 39 hours
 Assuming a mechanical carver could produce two busts in a long, 80-hour week, perhaps three with practice, this was still far behind the output for producing plaster casts
 And Achille Collas, manufacturing sculpture by machine in France, found that pirates immediately cast copies of his copies and sold them much cheaper than he could
 Watts sculpture-copying machines are enigmatic, then
 Watt even obtained a death mask of Matthew Boulton following his death in 1809, and this was copied six times in reduced form
 What became more significant than the commercial aspects of sculpture for Watt were the practicalities of multiplying his own image
 Other versions were placed in London, Glasgow and (1)(2) It was acclaimed as the finest resemblance of a man eulogized on his monument in Westminster Abbey as one of ‘the real Benefactors of the World
 As well as the Chantrey and Turnerelli busts, Watts workshop contains a mystery object that has only recently been identified
 The parts were scanned with a laser to produce a digital image, and these were then combined electronically to reveal a previously A reduced-size plaster mould and cast from the death mask of Matthew Boulton, James Watts business partner and friend, made 1809–19
 unknown bust of Watt, which was rendered into a physical artefact using a three-dimensional printer that built up layers of nylon fused together by heat
 The small copy was signed on the back, in Watts hand, ‘Reduced from Gahagans bust by scraping 1807 – giving a date for the original and a pointer to one of the Gahagan family of sculptors, although which of them remains unclear, being the artist commissioned to make the original
 Watt was, then, generating images of himself in considerable quantities
 His bust proved highly charismatic: when Edgeworth saw it she was struck ‘almost breathless, and in 1841 a writer was inspired by it to write that ‘As I came home, the booming rattle of the train seemed like the spirit of Watt still ani- mating inert matter
 more widely after his death
 Their nearest indus- trial counterparts were the machines used by the Bank of England to make the dies for minting coins, which used a similar stylus and cutting tool arrangement to engrave the detail of an original produced by an artist onto a steel copy
 Boultons minting machines are suggestive of a broader trend towards mechanization; in cotton factories, an automatic spinning machine of 1825 could process 100 lb of cotton sixteen times faster than the equivalent machine in 1780, in only 125 hours as opposed to 2,000
 Faced with these new capabilities, Thomas Carlyle, in his essay ‘Signs of the Times of 1829, characterized the period as ‘not an Heroical, Devotional, Philosophical, or Moral Age, but, above all others, the Mechanical (1)(2) It is the Age of Machinery, in every outward and inward sense of that word
 Watts steam engine was the icon of Carlyles age of machinery, instrumental in ‘effecting the most remarkable revolution in all departments of industry that the world has ever seen
 Although historians have realized since that the expectations of steam, and its status as a symbol of progress, ran somewhat in advance of its actual employment, and waterwheels actually provided more power generation than engines until the mid-nineteenth century, this did not reflect at that time on Watt himself
 The Romantic poet William Wordsworth believed Watt was, ‘considering both the magnitude and the universality of his genius >>>>>> perhaps the most extraordinary man that this country ever pro- duced
 He was elevated into the traditional national pantheon of aristocrats and monarchs, military men and statesmen
 The generation of so much iconography around Watt fed debates about the nature of his achievements throughout the nineteenth century
 The earliest articles that surveyed the engines development, in the Encyclopaedia Britannica of 1797, were written by Watts friend John Robison with input from (1)(2)63 An article in Olinthus Gregorys Treatise on Mechanics of 1807, accusing Watt of seeking to ‘repress the energies of his contemporaries and monopolize engine construction, was suppressed after pressure from (1)(2)64 After Watts death in 1819 his son remained avidly protective of his fathers reputation; François Arago, who wrote the first biography of James Senior, wrote of ‘the religious respect with which my friend the present Mr James Watt regards all that recalls the remembrance of his father
 This careful shaping of Watts legacy reflects a second aspect of the debate about him: whether he was a philosopher or a craftsman
 This was particularly manifested in manipulation of the story that, as a child, he was enthralled by the steam issuing from a kettle
 as subsequently told concerned the potential industrial power of the steam, Watt and his son instead emphasized that it was about the steams philosophical properties – in fact, Watt Junior himself modi - fied the original account
 By comparison, subsequent biographers, most notably Samuel Smiles, gave Watts workshop prominence in their accounts, identifying it as a place of handicraft rather than philosophy
 The controversy over Watts legacy, and what he stood for, has raged up to the present day as engineering and science have been afforded differing degrees of priority
 By the centenary of Watts death in 1919, however, he had been firmly reappropriated as a craftsman and engineer: it is telling that one of the largest groups of contributors to the commemorative appeal launched in 1919 ‘comprised workers in engineering and metal- working firms throughout the Birmingham region
 However, amid the books and two-dimensional material, the busts and other sculptural representations of Watt, his workshop itself has sometimes been mentioned but rarely considered in detail
 As Watt was continuously reappraised and reappropriated by different groups, his workshop always remained as a presence in the background
 Watt Junior kept the workshop door firmly locked and the room remained entirely untouched until his own death in 1848
 Muirheads description of the workshop indicates its tremendous imaginative power, for he wrote that The classical ‘garret and all its mysterious contents >>>>>> have ever since been carefully preserved in the same order as when the hand and ‘eye of the master were last withdrawn from them >>>>>> all things there seemed still to breathe of the spirit that once gave them life and energy; and only the presence of some reverend dust silently announced, that no profane hand, forgetful of the ‘religio loci [place of sanctity], had been permitted to violate the sanctities of that magical retreat
 For Muirhead the workshop was a place of religious significance, as it was for the biographer Samuel Smiles, who finished a detailed account of its contents by stating that in it the ‘spirit of Watts work survived, as if embodied in the artefacts ‘fast crumbling to decay
 Even if it had remained untouched for so long, the mere fact of its existence cast a spell over those concerned with Watt and how he was presented
 Alongside these items, however, Watts workshop remained the ultimate prize
 That came to nothing, but four months later, Francis Pettit Smith wrote rather unsubtly to James Gibson Watt, ‘How often I have longed to take a peep into Heathfield >>>>>> where I am informed a host of invaluable relics do still exist – which in honour to the illustrious man should once more see the daylight – and be preserved to the end of time in some public institute like this
 By January 1864 no progress had been made, and Woodcroft, exas- perated, wrote to Pettit Smith, ‘I am ready to go with you any day to Birmingham whether Mr Gibson Watt gives his permission or not
 Mechanical drawings, chemicals, optical instru- ments and almost every imaginable thing that room contains
 The visitors were so engrossed in what they saw that they spent seven hours exploring, and Woodcroft left his glasses behind; they Watts alleged ‘experimentalising steam kettle, forming part of a self-contained ‘bachelors stove with grate and cooking pan, c(1)
 were later returned to him by Mary Pemberton, daughter of the tenant, accompanied by a ‘kindly expressed note
 Woodcrofts fascination with the workshop reflected a very particular, mechanical view of the world and of (1)(2) This view was based on a realization that many of the industrial sites and machines of Britains Industrial Revolution were, even in the 1860s, at risk of destruction
 In Birmingham the Soho establishments associated with Boulton and Watt were dis - appearing, too
 A short distance away, the Soho Manufactory was either empty or being sublet, and was demolished in early 1863
 Individual machines also faced an uncertain future
 Unsurprisingly the engine was described as being ‘in a very rusty dilapidated condition by 1862
 Even if an artefact did perchance find its way to a museum, its survival was still not guaranteed, because popular fascination with historic machines was manifested in a very tactile, hands-on way
 Just as inventors achieved heroic status after 1850, so did the objects they built
 As with so many other artefacts, the future of Watts workshop was never entirely certain
 The heroic objects pictured include Richard Arkwrights spinning machine at bottom left, the locomotive Rocket alongside it, and the ‘Comet marine engine at top right
 facsimile of a small engine that had belonged to his illustrious predecessor, which was almost certainly intended as a gift to smooth the path of negotiation towards acquiring the workshop
 A com- peting group, the Birmingham-based Committee of the James Watt Memorial, was also attempting to preserve the workshop in April 1865
 The workshop remained at Heathfield for the rest of the nine- teenth century
 That is not generally known, & I have not mentioned it to anyone before
 Far from being undisturbed, the workshop contents were subject to some considerable disruption
 Aside from unexpected removals, the workshop contents were in a parlous physical condition by the 1880s
 What is clear from the inventory is the sheer diversity of the workshops contents: although Bennet Woodcroft sought to acquire the workshop as a shrine to Watt the steam engineer, he was inadvertently preserving evidence of a very different Watt who worked on a wide range of other projects
 The multifaceted nature of the workshop had already been noted by Samuel Smiles when he visited it in 1864 or 1865, and his evo- cation of what he saw is valuable enough to be quoted in detail: Many objects lay about or in the drawers >>>>>> busts, medallions, and figures, waiting to be copied by the sculpture machine, many medallion moulds, a store of plaster of Paris, and a box of plaster casts from (1)(2) Here are Watts ladles for melting lead, his foot-rule, his glue-pot, his hammer
 There are quadrant glasses, compasses, scales, weights, and sundry boxes of mathematical instruments >>>>>> on the shelves are minerals and chemicals in pots and jars, on which the dust of nearly half a century has settled
 Smiles wrongly identified a number of items in the workshop while describing them, including a model of the governor used by Watt to regulate the speed of the steam engine
 What in fact characterizes the workshop most of all is the close proximity of objects of ‘craft and ‘philosophy: ther m  o meters lie in drawers alongside tools for engraving scales, and sets of stamps for forming letters in metal
 Only in 1924 did a plan for preserving this diverse range of items finally coalesce
 In April 1924 Henry Lyons, director of the Science Museum in London, was in contact with Major Gibson Watt, and by November 1924 it was clear that the house would not be saved
 Watt would most likely be embarrassed at the amount of attention the workshop receives
 To conclude, then, we return to the question of whether Watt was a philosopher or a craftsman
 All of them belonged to one man, and the sheer quantity of material, crossing the boundaries between philosophy and craft, makes it hard to categorize the contents against any one of the labels that have been applied to Watt over time: philosopher or craftsman primarily, but engineer and chemist, as well
 In the fields of science and technology conceptions of ‘craft were for a long time particularly mechanical in their outlook
 In a world where not only science and technology but art and consumption besides came hand in hand, a young workman in his apron might equally have been a chemist avoiding splashes of acid or watching the thermometers during a heat experiment, a sculptor pouring wet plaster into moulds, an instrument maker engraving the scale on a quadrant, or a foundry- man fettling a cast Doric column-head for the framing of a beam engine
