 On the afternoon of 29 December 1924, Edward Collins stood alone, in a large, empty room at the top of a house on the edge of (1)(2) Outside the window, slates on the roofs of an adjoining wash house and dairy were beginning to slip, chimney pots leaned at odd angles, the trees were without leaves and a line of old lamp standards leaned against a wall from which the paint was flaking
 Edward Collins was middle-aged, an architect by training, a ‘most careful & painstaking man, fastidious about detail, just like his father, who had been his predecessor in the same post
 He also described himself as a ‘one-man job, with no colleagues, and he had not had a holiday since 1914, ten years earlier
 Answering the question of why Collins felt obliged to collect the dust from the room and send it to the Science Museum in London requires some elaboration
 Born in 1736 in Greenock, Scotland, and dying in 1819 in Birmingham, Watt is best known for his work on the steam engine, which became a symbol of Britains nineteenth-century industrial prowess, and he was the first engineer to be elevated into the pantheon of national heroes alongside soldiers and statesmen
 As it happens, the Science Museum decided against acquiring the dust
 This is a little disappointing because, if the reader will forgive the slight stretching of a scientific point, the dust would have represented the dna, not just of the steam engine, but of the many other projects that Watt worked on as well: plaster of Paris for copying sculptures, chemical substances of dif- ferent types, iron filings and turnings, maybe bits of brass and glass from scientific instruments
 The profusion of projects that Watt undertook is also reflected in the nature of the workshops larger objects
 The fragments associated with the engine, hidden in the drawers and boxes, could be counted on the fingers of two hands
 This is a book about making things during Britains Industrial Revolution, covering the period roughly from 1760 until 1820
 For this reason we might call this book a craft history of the Industrial Revolution, or a prehistory of engineering
 Recent surveys of the Industrial Revolution have emphasized the creation in Britain of a ‘knowledge economy, which succeeded because it could generate ‘useful knowledge and disseminate it to those who might exploit it commercially
 And the processes by which the former crossed over into the latter have also been analysed in detail: the historian Joel Mokyr has described them as the centrepiece of an ‘Industrial Enlightenment
 Having the infrastructure to support the widest possible flow of ideas was no doubt important to Britains economy as it indus- trialized during the later eighteenth century
 But many other practical people, while they undoubtedly worked ‘in a milieu in which the effects of the Enlightenment were pervasive, had little if any direct interest in science; or, at least, there is relatively little information to confirm that they did
 This is not to deny that scientific knowledge influenced how things were made
 However, we will attempt to move beyond abstract, theoretical science towards science that depended on physically carrying out experiments – manipulating heat and materials, for example – often in ways that were distinctly ‘industrial in character
 First, however, we have to manoeuvre into a position from which we can see what those other factors could have been
 This knowledge, encom- passing ‘dexterity >>>>>> technical savoir-faire >>>>>> experience, skills, and practical knowledge of energy and materials, could be conveyed only by lengthy hands-on training, and stored, not in written form, but in the minds of thousands of workers, craftsmen and artisans
 The question arises: can we get inside their minds to establish what they knew about the processes of making
 The answer is not quite as indecipherable as it might appear
 One of Foxs main objectives has been to show that these ‘scientific ways of working owed a lot to ‘the pragmatic methods of artisan culture, and it is implicit in this that artisans could be claimed as practical men with just as much validity as with which they could be appropriated as men of science
 We can go further than this: as well as the sources that Fox draws upon, there exists a huge range of three-dimensional tools, materials and finished artefacts that craftsmen and artisans used and generated in their everyday working lives
 But it exists and has been drawn on for this book
 We can use these myriad sources on tools and techniques to delve into the world of making things during the eighteenth century
 Watts ‘perfect engine is a great example of this: it was an astonishing concept, a feat of experimental science, conceptual understanding and precision engineering, but that didnt stop the men erecting it on a windy cliff top in Cornwall, unloading it from a wagon by the simple expedient of just tipping the entire wagon onto its side
 Exploring the world of making has two key questions, then
 In answering this, a number of inter- connected strands recur throughout the book, and they are briefly summarized here
 Artisans worked extensively to identify, acquire and find uses for new materials
 Processes of making were often associated with the places where raw materials could most easily be accessed
 Artisans organized production to work materials into finished products
 The range of organizational possibilities was huge: from large concerns like Matthew Boultons Soho Manufactory, which employed upwards of 500 people, to tiny one-man businesses operating from a garret at home
 Artisans innovated in the techniques used in their manufacturing processes, devising many new ones but often amplifying and re - inventing those that were well-established and applying them under new circumstances to new materials and products
 And across a similar range of trades, one of the most valuable abilities was being able to accurately judge temperature by eye
 Lastly, artisans had to find a way to market their finished product
 Alternatively, direct contact with customers could be best achieved by running a more high-profile retail operation
 These five building blocks of making – product, materials, organization, techniques and marketing – suggest that artisans were as much endowed with entrepreneurial and commercial skills as they were with practical ability
 This high degree of innovation and resourcefulness went beyond that simply associated with new techniques
 The second key aspect of making things concerns not just the question of ‘how
 This analysis has its starting point in the idea of ‘path dependency, which con- tends that if, for example, Britain had plentiful supplies of coal and iron ore, it would be more likely to adopt new technologies which burned coal and smelted iron ore than those that exploited water power or timber resources
 The baseline for this analysis is that in Britain the practical contribution made by craftsmen and artisans was highly valued
 In 1803 the economist and businessman Jean-Baptiste Say wrote how ‘the enormous wealth of Britain is less owing to her own advances in scientific acquirements, high as she ranks in that department, as to the wonderful practical skills of her adventurers in the useful application of knowledge and the superiority of her workmen in rapid and masterly execution
 Beyond the innate instinct for technological creativity that motiv - ated these craftsmen and artisans, other factors as well as science influenced the paths that making things would advance along
 Paradoxically, despite it becoming an emblem of Britains nineteenth-century industrial prowess, many, if not most, industrial processes were not steam-powered
 The tremendous demand for consumer goods also influenced what products were made
 As the historian David Landes wrote, ‘the Englishman of the 1750s was closer in material things to Caesars legionnaires than to his own great-grandchildren
 It was not just the quantity of possessions present in households that changed but their sheer range, the choice of materials and how they were branded, packaged and sold as well
 A booming middle class wanted to display its affluence, and did so by spending money on things which gave an impression of distinc- tion and newness, or modernity
 The third factor influencing which things were made was a widely held fascination with precision
 Matthew Boulton knew that, with his new coin-minting machinery, eight tuppenny pieces laid end to end would measure exactly twelve inches in length, providing a useful means of identifying counterfeits
 Finally, the classical world exerted considerable sway on the products that were made
 Industrialists mined antiquity for inspiration: the potter Josiah Wedgwood made vases one of his main product lines, kickstarting what Matthew Boulton hailed as ‘vasemania – ‘an epidemical mad- ness >>>>>> for vases, which must be gratified
 It is difficult to treat these factors in a linear way
 It is to Watt that we now turn
 James Watts high standing was based on his personal reputation and that of the engine, and both are closely intertwined
 At a London meeting in June 1824 to call for a public monument to commemorate Watt, the Earl of Liverpool wrote that by his steady perseverance, by the sagacity of his mind, by his patient thinking >>>>>> he was enabled to apply the profoundest principles of science to the practical purposes of life; and >>>>>> augment incalculably the resources of his own country, and even of the whole world
 At the same meeting, the chemist and inventor Sir Humphry Davy proclaimed of Watt, If you seek his monument, look around you >>>>>> Look round the metropolis; our towns >>>>>> our dock-yards, and our manu- factories; examine the subterraneous cavities below the surface, and the works above; contemplate our rivers and our canals, and the seas which surround our shores, and every where will be found records of the eternal benefits conferred on us by this great man
 Such words quickly consolidated Watts reputation as a colossus of Britains Industrial (1)(2)
 In 1948 the engine was described by the histor - ian (1) (1) Ashton as ‘the pivot on which industry swung into the modern age, and more recently Watt was called ‘a symbol of >>>>>> everything that was progressive and innovative in Britain during the eighteenth century
 How, then, to carve out a niche in this busy marketplace
 What underpinned all of these different identities was his ability not just to think but to do: to use tools, techniques and materials, to create tangible things across a range of activities
 The major issue to be overcome here is avoiding what John Griffiths described as ‘Wattolatry: the worship of (1)(2)33 An element of this is unavoidable: the Science Museum has four Watt engines and his library in its collection, and his voluminous personal and business papers are preserved at (1)(2) The path dependency of how we write history depends on what sources have survived, and this is skewed heavily towards Watt rather than many of his colleagues
 Watt was not alone in being inquisitive and resourceful, making his way, recording progress and what he found; quite the opposite
 Johann Conrad Fischer was a pioneering Swiss steel-maker who made contact with many of Englands eminent industrialists and manufacturers
 What comes across from many of these accounts is the impact of the processes of making, and the products that were created, on the contemporary imagination
 Later commentators agreed, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, who believed the English had successfully ‘impressed their direct-ness and practical habit onto modern civilisation
 One writer has it that Patrick OBriens naval stories of the Napoleonic Wars acquired a life of their own when he realized that they were ‘the Englishmans Troy tales, as historic - ally and mythically rich, and imaginatively exploitable as the story that produced The Iliad
 To return to the dust in Watts workshop, it represented the long, multifaceted and highly productive career of one man
 In asking ourselves whether we want the dust, the answer surely has to be – yes

 On 18 June 1755 he arrived in the city, having travelled on horseback for 470 miles from Greenock, (1)(2) Tired and saddle- sore, he found himself transplanted from a maritime town of 3,000 souls 22 miles west of Glasgow into the heart of the biggest city on earth, ‘a Prodigy of Buildings, that nothing in the World does, or ever did, surpass, containing one in eight of Britains entire popu - lation, consuming every year 2,957,000 bushels of flour, 700,000 sheep, 238,000 pigs and 100,000 oxen, burning 590,000 tonnes of coal and drinking 7 million barrels of beer
 And the German scientist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg had expressed in April 1770 how he ‘could not possibly describe what strange figures he saw, ‘half-naked men and women, children, chimney- sweeps, tinkers, Moors and men of letters, fishwives and females in grand array
 Wapping was a marine community, huddled on the north bank of the Pool of London, the centre of a global shipping network
 That the area, with its reputation for lawlessness, should also encompass middle-class affluence and relative prosperity indi- cates the polarized nature of the society Watt found himself living in
 The amount of drinking which went on, as recorded in accounts of the time, is amazing
 Of all these inscriptions, I am sorry to observe, that ‘Dealer in foreign spirituous liquors is by far the most frequent
 In short, much of the nation sought to be ‘drunk for a penny, dead drunk for tuppence
 Peoples capacity for drinking was matched by their appetite for violence

 Infec - tious diseases such as tuberculosis, dysentery and typhus cut swathes through the population, and death could come from the most unex- pected directions – even the lead used in cosmetics could finish off the fashionable
 Britain in the eighteenth century was, in many respects, a society of extremes
 A medical operation could trans- form genteel appearances into bloody horror
 Watts early encounters with this world, his upbringing and training in the rudiments of business offer a valuable insight into the infrastructure that facilitated Britain becoming the worlds first industrial nation
 For all its polarities, British eighteenth-century society was a fertile place for young men like Watt to make their way
 It was a world which, broadly, didnt go hungry: Britain could feed itself
 Communal open fields were replaced by enclosure, consolidating land into bigger farms run more efficiently by a single farmer
 Britains population was also growing rapidly – from about 6
 More people meant more demand for products, more workers to be ‘drilled into a supple labour force and more people capable of devising new technological ideas
 The growing population was also increasingly mobile
 American traveller Louis Simond commented: You meet nowhere with those persons who never were out of their native place, and whose habits are wholly local >>>>>> To go up to town from 100 or 200 miles distance, is a thing done on a sudden >>>>>> In France the people of the provinces used to make their will before they undertook such an expedition
 And the Romantic poet Robert Southey was struck by how travel ‘is one of the pleasures of the English; and people >>>>>> set out upon a journey of two hundred leagues to amuse themselves
 So, eighteenth-century Britain was getting more populous, and its people were increasingly likely to travel in pursuit of work and new opportunities
 Watt was the fourth child for Agnes and James Senior but the first to survive past infancy
 With this catalogue of infant mortality, his parents must have been continually worried for James, who had a frail constitution as a boy, being troubled by poor health and migraines which made him ‘languid, depressed and fanciful
 Herbert Bourne after Marcus Stone, Watts First Experiment, 1879
 treatises on chemistry, such as Robert Dossies The Elaboratory Laid Open, or; The Secrets of Modern Chemistry and Pharmacy Revealed (1758), Richard Brookess The General Practice of Physic (1751) and David Fordyces Dialogue Concerning Education (1745), can be found later additions, like John Crofts Scrapeana (1792), describing itself as ‘A medley of choice bon mots, repartees, &c
 But he was not just content to read, and sought to expand from ideas into practice
 It is rather crude and is covered with Watts practisings of his signature
 Moving to Glasgow placed Watt at the commercial hub of west- ern (1)(2) The quays lining the Clyde Estuary were crowded with bales of tobacco and boxes of herring, bar-iron, hemp for sails and nets, timber for boats and houses and salt for preserv - ing fish
 Watt Senior traded all sorts of goods around the (1)(2) A letter he received from his son titled ‘Invoice of goods bought at Glasgow records tanned skins, padlocks, a quire of marble paper, two dozen pencils and more
 His uncle John Muirheid was on hand to show him the ropes
 In fact, his cousin Marion Campbell recalls that while in Glasgow, Watt met with good society, and formed friendships with several intelligent and well-educated young men; they had frequent evening meetings to give or receive information
 This image of Watt and his young acquaintances offers a glimpse of the webs of contacts which coalesced in so many places across Britain, often based in the new coffee houses that were springing up everywhere
 Their influence endures today: the insurance market Lloyds of London started as a coffee house, and the layout of the trading floors remains based on the wooden booths and stools used by its eighteenth-century inhabitants
 Watt and his acquaintances would have discussed many of the networks which aided and abetted their everyday lives, from the difficulties of travel to local government
 The most useable highways were old Roman roads which still had their original surfaces left, but even these were prone to subsidence, turning into ditches which became morasses of mud
 recorded as lying in ‘low, flat, miry country flooded with rainfall from the surrounding hills which, ‘for want of a proper current to carry such waters off, [inundated a] great part of the road, which is frequently under water
 One solution was to build turnpike roads, paid for by users
 Practically nowhere in England could not be reached within four days
 If roads sped the passage of relatively portable things like news or ideas, more bulky items went by boat
 In 1774, 1,800 vessels hefted coal from Newcastle to London, while 900 more carried other freight – mainly raw materials, grain and other bulky items – and the size of each individual ship doubled in the 25 years after 1750
 Efficient shipping was crucial to the industrializing economy
 And, just as many British citizens liked a fight, so the country itself was extraordinarily pugnacious
 The ‘hands-off approach of central government was commented on by many overseas visitors, one of whom noted: Greenock in 1768, by Robert Paul of (1)(2) The town, where Watt was born and spent his early life, was an important port and maritime centre
 the greatest benefit which the government confers >>>>>> is that of doing nothing at all: in the whole of this country there are no regulations >>>>>>and, in the eyes of an impartial traveller, England has the appearance of being a hundred times richer than (1)(2)
 At the local and national level, those representing the state remained accountable for their actions
 The monarch couldnt raise taxes without Parliamentary approval – and Britain was 140 years ahead of France in having the people execute their king
 The infrastructure of transport and information networks, and the state, provided Britain with her blood vessels and nervous system
 His awareness of his social position relative to his asso- ciates is suggestive of Britains social structure, the skeleton or framework for the whole enterprise
 Britain had a strong and durable social hierarchy
 These different social classes together formed an enormous pyramid, with the 186 ‘Lords Spiritual and Temporal at the top, and the bottom comprising j a m e s  w at t labourers, the poor and the destitute
 (1) Engleheart after William Hogarth, Four Times of the Day: Noon, 1833, engraving
 But while Britains social structure was closely defined, it was by no means overly rigid
 Rather, it was flexible – far more so than in France, Germany or Russia – and this helped Josiah Wedgwood query ‘whether I am a landed gentleman, an engineer or a potter, for indeed I am all three
 Although the cotton entrepreneur Sir Richard Arkwright started out as a wigmaker, for example, the movement  wasnt just up wards
 Britains social structure offered stability, but with the possibility of mobility for individuals if they sought it
 The close interplay between the classes facilitated industrial change
 Indeed, sinking ones capital into industry was by no means ungentlemanly
 If Watt and his young merchant friends in Glasgow aspired to ascend the social ladder, they sought to do so by meeting the demands of Britains middle classes, the customers for many of the goods they would make and trade
 Consumer spending was to be a motor for commerce and a stimulus for industrial change
 This acquisitive impulse came with some strings attached, however
 There are steel traps and spring guns here
 First, the tax system was highly regressive – that is, the wealthier you were, the less tax you paid as a proportion of your income
 Most taxes were placed on goods for which demand was high – beer, salt, glass, tea, sugar and tobacco – upon which the poor spent a much higher proportion of their income
 This, then, was the world Watt found himself entering as a young merchant with his commercial friends in (1)(2) It was a world of possibilities for advancement but, equally, Watt and his friends had to create those possibilities for themselves
 In many aspects of life an informal code of behaviour sup - plemented the formal laws of the land
 People also had to shift for themselves; because the state largely kept out of business, individuals expected to have to work in partnership with their fellows, and adhering to particular rules of conduct made for a smoother-running partner- ship
 It is against this background that Watt left Scotland for the first time, in June 1755, and travelled to train as a scientific-instrument maker in (1)(2) The precise motivation for this dramatic change is unclear, but he was now nineteen and needed to consider his longer-term prospects
 Whatever happened, Watt found himself making the long journey south by horse to seek out a master
 A basic premise of politeness was to maintain a respectable appear ance
 Only afterwards did he realize that ‘In England, any person undertaking so long a journey on foot, is sure to be looked upon, and considered as either a beg- gar, or a vagabond
 ‘The Mathematical Instrument Maker, from The Book of Trades (1824)
 foot may have been as much about preserving appearances as practicalities
 Respectability went hand-in-hand with trustworthiness
 He showed Watt ‘some fine new compasses of a new invented metal and soon had Watt working at the brass parts of Hadleys quadrants, used for naviga- tion
 Morgans manners were as important to his commercial persona as his technical ingenuity
 This was a widely accepted practice: when François de La Rochefoucauld visited a button manufactory in Sheffield during February 1785, the owner not only showed us all his workshops, one after another, but he was careful to begin each with the workman explaining each process in the greatest detail; and as we were there with him five hours he invited us to take tea with his mother
 Jabez Maud Fisher was pleased, on first meeting Edmund Radcliffe, ‘the greatest Manufacturer in England, writing that he ‘makes me very flattering offers of Interest and Introduction to his Corre s   - pon dents in Spain, Portugal and France
 Once Watt had established with associates that he was a respect - able, trustworthy and well-mannered young man, he built his personal network through regular correspondence, letters of introduction and bills of exchange
 Philipp Andreas Nemnich toured Britain in 1805–6 with no fewer than 1,200 letters of introduction to hand out
 The involvement of a third party also characterized bills of exchange
 An important part of Watts commercial training would have been to establish how these credit webs worked
 Finally, letters encouraged a rich flow of information around (1)(2) At one level, Watt could write from London to his father at Greenock, ‘I have had a fit of the Rheumatism which has been very troublesome to me – tho not so bad as to make me keep the House >>>>>> In other respects I never had my health better since I remember
 On another level, news of major events spread fast
 He even breath- lessly described the declaration of war against France in May 1756, noting, ‘Their [sic] was the greatest mob fever saw which you can have no idea of unless you was acquainted in (1)(2)96 Watt also sent commercial intelligence, warning his father that competing merchant William McDowal ‘has got some books draughts & other things >>>>>> & am afraid he will be able to undersell you, as well as news of the latest fashions, which he had difficulty keeping up with: sending items requested by his father, he replied, ‘I am sorry the handkerchiefs were not better but as it is a thing that I am no judge of I am the more excusable
 Britain, then, reverberated with news and views, bills of exchange and letters of introduction moving with travellers on land and at sea
 He worked on scales and rules for calculating and measuring, and Hadleys quadrants for navigation
 By June 1756 Watt was preparing to return to (1)(2) He had been in London for one year, less than the full seven-year appren- ticeship usual at the time, but he had the makings of a ‘sensible, ingenious and enterprizing Man, who plans and executes with equal Expedition – a later description of Birmingham industrialist Matthew Boulton, but one which seems apt for Watt, too
 An invitation to James Watts workshop at Glasgow College was highly prized among the colleges students
 Working at Glasgow College, Watt found that his interests were widely shared
 Foremost among them were Adam Smith, founder of the modern science of economics; David Hume, one of the most influential Western philoso- phers; Joseph Black, the chemist who discovered carbon dioxide (see page 49); James Hutton, who founded the discipline of geology; and Adam Ferguson, the founder of sociology
 Having learned his trade as an instrument maker, Watt found himself immersed in the Scottish Enlightenment and a new popular culture that was fascinated by science
 Although this kept the business afloat, making instruments would not sustain Watt in a long-term career, but it did provide the springboard for his next big project: working on the steam engine
 As Watt began his career making scientific instruments, he was launching himself into a culture where a vigorous ‘taste for science, over all classes of men, in every nation of Europe >>>>>> seems to be the characteristic feature >>>>>> In no former age, was ever the light of knowledge so extended, and so generally diffused
 Sometimes this interest appears to have been superficial: one writer recalled seeing ‘how a noble lord, taking a piece of string from his pocket, had measured off a row of books >>>>>> and bargained for them by the yard or ell, with- out glancing at their titles or contents
 of the solar system named after the Earl of Orrery, the proud purchaser of the first one
 Lecturers occupied a strategic position in promoting science in the wider economy
 Three hundred pounds would purchase the kit required and, with luck, the proceeds from a single lecture course in coffee houses or instrument shops could recover the initial outlay
 Alongside teachers and lecturers, there were others for whom instruments were very much a workaday tool: practitioners like navigators, surveyors and civil engineers
 By 1788 there were 12,464 ships registered in the uk, a number which would more than double by 1851
 Instrument makers stood at the intersection between practition- ers demands and new scientific discoveries
 On the other, the sheer size of the solar system was becoming apparent
 It is against this background that Watt took his first steps, not learning his trade, but as a professional instrument maker
 Watt was held in some esteem – Black was later to recall Watt as ‘a young man possessing most uncommon talents for mechanical knowledge and practice, with an originality, readiness, and conspicuousness of invention, which often surprised and delighted me in our frequent conversations together
 Watt developed a reputation within Glasgow College, then, as the ‘go to man for anything that needed making
 In September 1758 he had a moment of appraisal
 He ended gloomily, noting that if his venture failed he would have to ‘fall into some other way of business as this will not do in the present situation
 He would use his inventive abilities to make instruments in bulk at minimum cost, not for professors at the college but for bigger markets beyond its walls
 Mass-producing instruments meant that Watt aimed for the biggest market he could, and in Glasgow that meant the practitioners
 One of his principal products was the Hadleys quadrant
 He expected to be able to make ‘14 dozen every year or about three every week, and he was confident ‘of selling more than I can get made
 Another of Watts major products was a machine for drawing in perspective which he developed and sold from 1765
 Looking through a peep- sight at the subject, and tracing a pointer around its outline, a complex jointed wood and brass frame transferred the image onto the paper with a pencil, complete with perspective
 Watt had set his sights on supplying a bigger market with a focused range of standardized products
 Watt wrestled with these challenges against the back- drop of great change in precision manufacture
 For a long time, instruments were made of wood, but it could be a temperamental material
 letter-copying machine during the dry American summer in 1803, but complained that when it rained, the mechanism ‘swelled and tightened so much that he could finish his letters only by unscrewing and loosening all the parts
 However, the flexing, expan- sion and contraction of the wood limited the instruments accuracy
 Efforts were made to shrink it so it could be made of more durable metal without becoming too heavy
 It could be formed into tubes to make telescopes, or joined by using a flame, molten metal solder and a blowpipe, for which the instrument maker needed a cyclical breathing technique, breathing in the nose and out of the mouth simultaneously to obtain a constant high-temperature heat
 The quest for high-quality instrument mirrors and lenses simi - larly tested opticians ingenuity
 It was difficult, laborious work, and the optician John Yarwell wrote to the astronomer Abraham Sharp complaining about his difficulties making the lenses: ‘I must confess I have had more complaint from you than from all the rest of mankind, with the least profit, for the last you had
 Working brass and glass into precision instruments led to innov - ation in three key areas
 The precision engineer Richard Roberts employed his wife for this duty, working in a bedroom while his wife drove the lathe from the basement
 Screw threads – cylinders with an indented spiral running around the outside – were essential to successful precision instruments
 At first they required highly skilled hand work
 London instrument maker Jesse Ramsden later built a number of special screw-cutting lathes, and their output was used to make fine adjustments in all sorts of instruments – some later threads were employed in measuring devices claiming an accuracy of within one-millionth of an inch
 Another use of screw threads was to make, or ‘divide, graduated scales
 The work was so delicate that some London makers kept their tools and the scales at a near- constant temperature to avoid distortions caused by thermal expan- sion, only working in early mornings during the spring and autumn
 And, as he had devised ways of cutting screw threads, between 1768 and 1774 Ramsden also cracked the problem of making scales by machine
 A complete, immensely accurate scale could now be made by relatively unskilled labour, not in a matter of days, but in half an hour
 Making the best use of these new materials and techniques determined the organization of the instrument trade
 In Sheffield ‘Little Mesters rented space in a factory and sold their output to its owner
 A consequence of this complex trade structure was that the name engraved on a finished instrument was a ‘brand name – that of a businessman and designer in overall charge of the manufac- turing process but responsible for physically making few of the components
 What was the ‘Watt brand
 Far from being a solitary craftsman, Watt assembled a team of employees
 Only one of them, John Gardner, was with Watt for the long haul – in fact, he became Watts right-hand man and took over the instrument making busi- ness in about 1770
 Having developed his team, Watt also remained closely linked to the instrument making trade in (1)(2) He was well acquainted with Jesse Ramsden: he had his business correspondence sent to Ramsdens shop and they also corresponded about a telescope Watt developed, which survives in his workshop, that could be used to measure distances
 But in technical terms there was a gulf between the world of making instruments in London and Glasgow, and explaining this requires consideration of the materials and techniques Watt used in instrument making
 Both brass and glass can be found in quantities in Watts work- shop, and references to many other materials can be traced in his ledgers
 Black ebony from India or Mauritius, and maho g any from the Caribbean, tended to warp and twist less than other woods, and were often used for the frames of scientific Jesse Ramsden alongside his dividing engine, (1) Jones after Robert Home, 1790
 instruments, with graduated scales to take measurements added in brass
 Plane wood (called ‘plaintree by Watt) was used in musical instruments, while John Williams of Newcastle provided Watt with ‘tubes and cylinders of glass
 To work these materials, Watt used hand tools extensively and drawer upon drawer of them remain in his workshop
 It includes among much else a ‘standing vice – probably a leg vice to fit on the side of a workbench – hammers and anvils in different sizes, files for shaping metal, cast and plate brass, screw plates for cutting threads on metal rods, dividers and compasses, an iron brace and bits for drilling holes, a selection of hardwoods, tortoiseshell and mother-of-pearl for instrument making and even ‘an alphabet of letters – letter stamps for marking wood or metal
 Many of Watts tools can be matched against contemporary descriptions of workshop equipment
 Others can be spotted in the details of the sale arranged when the watchmaker Larcum Kendall died in 1790
 Many of the basic tools are similar, and these are a counter balance to the emphasis on mechanization, lathes and dividing engines in instrument making
 What were Watts equivalent ‘curious tools, and how successful were they
 Prominent among Watts early specialized tools were printing plates for making the scales on quadrants and other instruments
 One has two scales depending on the temp - erature: ‘Dry/Very Dry; Set Fair/Set Frost; Fair/Frost; Changeable; Rain/Snow; Much Rain/Much Snow; Stormy, which is suggestive of the ferocious Glaswegian weather, about which Watt could describe to a friend the ‘100 people I see just now running by wett to the skin, no doubt cursing god in their hearts
 It may also be that these more ingenious techniques are not as novel as they appear at first sight
 This called for the use of a ‘strong iron bar – a beam compass – with a centre-pin on one end, and fitted with ‘a tooth of steel with such roundings and hollows in the bottom of it, as I intended to have hollows and roundings upon my work on the other
 Watts scriber for making multiple lines at once is a simpler form of what Moxon describes here
 Historian of mechanism Michael Wright has even suggested that one of Watts projects appears to have gone subtly wrong
 But it hasnt been used much, and some detective work shows us why
 If Watts attempt at constructing a dividing engine went awry, he had more success making screw threads
 A year later, he wrote again to Small, ‘I had occasion to use my last dividing screw for the first time the other day >>>>>> It did not err the 1/200th of an inch in the whole 9 inches
 The London instrument makers were an acknowledged elite and their capabilities do not necessarily reflect those elsewhere
 He took a copy of Nicholas Bions The Construction and Principal Uses of Mathematical Instruments, translated into English by Edmund Stone, with him when he returned from London to (1)(2) Also in his library were Gregorys The Elements of Astronomy, Physical and Geometrical, Desaguliers A Course of Experimental Philosophy and Smiths Compleat System of (1)(2)64 And he borrowed Gravensandes Elements of Natural Philosophy from his father
 But whether Watts business demanded that he pursued such a theoretically grounded, precise approach is doubtful
 Watt wrote to his father, ‘If you can get a good well shaped Davis quadrant that has been approved by some experienced seaman send it up
 So for some instrument makers, ‘good enough was preferable to ‘the best, and satisfied their customers
 Concentrating on making instruments that were just good enough did not preclude innovation and awareness of the latest new theories in other areas, however
 Of more immediate import is how Smiths theories of how the economy worked relate to practices inside Watts workshop
 There survive objects from Watts Glasgow workshop that embody this revolutionary approach – the theory that would underpin the rise of the factory system in (1)(2) And they are associated with one of Watts more surprising business ventures: making musical instruments
 But commercially they were in much demand, and the tools and techniques needed to make them differed little from those needed to make scientific instruments
 The range of tools in Watts workshop matches closely those needed for flute making as described in Louis Bergerons Manuel du Tourneur of 1816
 Watt was also applying these ideas to manufacture of his perspective drawing apparatus: in one corner of his workshop sits a wooden box packed with the incomplete remains of a number of these, as well as many components awaiting assembly
 Watts special tool for undercutting three finger holes on a flute at once
 Some of Watts pin gauges for marking the positions of finger holes on flutes
 was not unique in this respect, but the survival of such artefacts given Watts association with Adam Smith makes them significant
 Significant in another way is one final artefact illustrating Watts business practices
 But perhaps the fashionable young gents who would be Watts potential market in Glasgow were not too discerning
 Watt wasnt just making flutes
 His plan was to divide the fingerboard into two interlocking parts
 But from the heap of unfinished fingerboards in Watts workshop, it would appear that Watt saw some promise in the idea and may have been commissioned to make them by Clagget before he obtained his patent
 Watts musical instruments may not have won prizes, but making them helped him show off a canny talent for invention that a London instrument maker would have been proud of
 Watts shop strategy reflects the scale of the market for instru- ments that could be used at home
 The naturalist Gilbert White recorded thermometer, barometer and even wind readings in a ready-printed diary by Benjamin White of Fleet Street, London, and his observations contributed to his Natural History of Selborne, a pioneering holistic study of the environment he lived in
 very pretty curious sight, for we see the whole solar system move by clockwork, in the same manner as they do in the heavens
 Later in his diary he records, ‘There being at Joness a person with an electrical machine, my niece and I went to see it, and though I had seen it several years ago, I think there is something in it agreeable and instructing, but yet at the same time very surprising
 To launch himself fully into the world of instrument retailing, Watt entered business partnership in October 1759 with John Robert Sayer, Astronomy, c(1), engraving
 Craig, a Glasgow-based merchant and architect
 Watt could proudly write to his father, ‘my shop does very well
 Watt was following a retail trend already established elsewhere
 Gradually the divisions between mathematical and optical instru- ments disappeared – both types sat side by side on the shelves, awaiting customers
 Shops were places where an astute instrument maker would unashamedly show off his wares: to demonstrate his telescopes, John Marshall had his name painted in white on the roof of a house twenty houses away from the shop, and prospective telescope purchasers were encouraged to spot it
 But Watts expanding business empire also shows us how vulnerable an artisan-entrepreneur could be to financial problems and competition
 When the microscope maker John Cuff gave up his London shop because he worked too slowly to sustain the business, he found that even in Norwich there were ‘several persons who sell Optical Instruments of an inferior sort and of late, Riders are imployed >>>>>> who comes to seek out Customers & get orders
 Instrument making was not a trade without risks, and this was certainly the case for (1)(2)
 Watt also had competition in (1)(2) George Jarden was another blacksmith and mathematical instrument maker active at the same time as Watt, but in 1757 Watt commissioned him to divide the scales on some instruments for the surveyor John Gray, suggesting the two had an amicable relationship
 Carlile must have been a daunting competitor to relative newcomer Watt, who seems only slowly to have appreciated the value of catalogues, trade cards and instruction books to boost sales
 Watts foray into the world of instrument making brought mixed results
 However, although many aspects of his work were highly ingenious, and he must have received a thorough grounding in running a business, Glasgow was a limited marketplace, which brought financial difficulties and meant that Watts ambitions outran what he could achieve there
 In the winter of 1763–4 a model engine was brought to Watt by John (1)(2) Anderson found that the model would only work for a short time before coming to a halt
 As Watt dismantled Andersons model, the engines used in Britain were ‘atmospheric, a type first developed by the Dartmouth iron- monger Thomas Newcomen in or before 1712
 Newcomens atmospheric engine was simple, robust and reliable
 This didnt matter so much if the engine worked at a The model engine belonging to John Anderson that Watt repaired in the winter of 1763–4
 coal mine, burning unsaleable ‘slack coal, small pieces and dust
 It offended his sensibilities that Newcomens atmospheric engine wasted so much fuel
 This story was narrated by John Robison, a student at Glasgow College who had a curious ability to find himself present at some of the eighteenth centurys defining moments
 As Watts instrument-making work was underpinned by a great deal of reading and study, so his insights into his workbench projects went beyond what a more ordinary mechanic or instrument maker might have diagnosed
 Watt eventually returned the model to Anderson; he had already sawn its pump casing in half, for example, and even more radical measures than Anderson would have countenanced were needed to make it work to Watts satisfaction
 John Robison walked without ceremony into Watts parlour to find him seated before the fire with ‘a little tin cistern resting upon his knee
 The separate condenser was possibly the greatest single im - provement ever made to the steam engine
 Instrument makers were at the heart of a new and expanding scientific culture that was as much commercial and practical as it was philosophical, and the technicalities of instrument making were solid foundations for the business of building steam engines
 Instrument makers were early on resolving the problems of making artefacts in metal that were as robust as they were accurately made
 Making brass tubes for telescopes already took serious effort: a brass sheet would be formed into a rough cylinder and this was then squeezed between a steel mandrel and a die (the former forming the inner and the latter the outer surfaces) using a force of several tons, to give it a precise diameter
 Watt was also early in what became a longstanding relationship between instrument makers and steam engines
 Among the instruments can be seen a number of model steam engines
 into the 1860s
 Now, for Watt, the challenge of scaling up his engine meant he had to master the dynamics of the steam and heat contained inside it
 three Looking for a Living, 1764–
 Glasgow became, then, a prosperous reflection of Scotlands growing industrial and commercial power
 We have already explored Watts instrument making business, and his introduction to the steam engine, within the context of a burgeoning scientific culture
 Chemical workplaces like this were important for Scotlands industrialization, and Watts future career
 also fundamental to Watts understanding of how the engine worked, underpinning its evolution into a machine on an indus- trial scale
 The Scottish Enlightenment saw close bonds forged between the universities in cities such as Glasgow or Edinburgh, and part- ners in industry
 Rather than concentrating on attaining abstract knowl edge about humankind and the natural world within a purely academic setting, improvement was a motivation for tangibly better - ing humankinds situation and, as the earlier philosopher Francis Bacon had described it, helping in ‘the relief of mans estate
 Andersons lectures were in demand because, after 1750, Scotland was home to a broad and strengthening range of industries
 Linen production stretched across central Scotland and much of the output was sold in English markets, reflecting the importance of the Act of Union of 1707 in bringing political and economic integration with (1)(2) Profits from lucra- tive trades such as the import of tobacco were invested in other sectors, including marine stores for shipping, glass, bleaching and metals
 This resilient industrial base provided particularly fertile ground for the application of new philosophical research in chemistry
 William Cullen, distinguished professor at Glasgow and then Edinburgh until 1789, had declared, Does the joiner want a particular glew [sic]
 Does the dyer want a means of tinging a cloth of a particular colour
 But it was Cullens student and assistant Joseph Black who most fully devoted himself to building bridges between research and its industrial applications
 It may have been his reticence that made him reluctant to write much down: he would not publish his important research on heat, for example, and it only became public when a pirated version of his College lectures appeared, unauthorized, in 1770
 Blacks consultancy illustrates the fruitful flow of ideas estab- lished in Scotland between philosophical science and its industrial applications
 He developed a detailed knowledge of the characteristics of iron ores, identifying a huge reserve of high-quality ore in Scotland to supply the foundries there
 John Anderson, c(1)
 In the 1780s Scottish weavers produced over 7,000 miles of cloth every year
 And they also forged links with others like John Roebuck, who had established an industrial plant for making sulphuric acid near Edinburgh in 1749, and James Keir, raised in Scotland but working in England, who turned synthetic alkali manufacture into a commer - cial process for the first time
 Scotland devel- oped a prospering chemical industry that stands as a counterbalance to concepts of the Industrial Revolution as traditionally dominated by textiles manufacture and the application of steam power, for example
 This new industry had two key characteristics
 This prosperity was reflected in the expansion of Glasgow: the city grew from 23,000 to 42,000 inhabitants between 1755 and 1780, and ‘The Bleacher, working on one of the enormous fields where cloth was bleached white by the sun; from The Book of Trades (1824)
 the populations character changed, too
 But increasingly the ideas of the people were enlarged, and schemes of trade and improvement were adopted, and put into practice, the undertakers of which, in former times, would have been denounced madmen; a new stile [sic] was introduced in build- ing, in living, in dress, and in furniture; the conveniences, the elegances of life began to be studied [and] luxury advanced with hasty strides every day >>>>>> every person is employed, not a beggar is to be seen in the streets, the very children are busy
 Second, this newfound economic stimulus found physical form in a new culture of consumption
 of the inhabitants of Glasgow, more especially since the rapid rise of the manufac - tures, which have diffused wealth more generally among the people than before, has occasioned a consequent alteration in their dress, furniture, education, and amusements
 New consumer goods, as demanded by the denizens of Glasgow and across Britain, were not simply material possessions but signi - fied membership of a new, refined social class defined by prosperity and an awareness of the latest tastes
 The German writer Sophie von La Roche, visiting London in 1786, was amazed by the citys profusion of ‘watchmakers, silversmiths, china-shops, confectioners without equal, and the goods so elegantly displayed behind those fine glass windows
 It was against this background that James Watt met his wife
 Although it is traditionally stated that they lived in a house on Delftfield Lane, just to the west of Glasgows city centre, Watt and Peggy seem to have moved or ‘flitted several times around (1)(2)
 The shop frontage of (1) Mackenzie, mathematical and philosophical instrument maker, taken from his trade card, c(1)
 A first son was born in July 1765, but died aged only four months
 Such levels of child mortality were not unusually high, but constituted a tragic background to Watts career
 The world around Watt and his family was shaped by increasing prosperity and the rise of a consumer culture which prized material possessions
 Another, of more imme- diate import here, is in John Roebucks pressing need for an engine to work at his coal mines
 Roebuck had attended the lectures given in Glasgow by Joseph Black and was a speculative investor in interests that included acid manufacture, the iron foundry at Carron and coal mining
 Watt, it seemed, was his man
 Watts partnership with Roebuck involved extensive work improv- ing the engines design
 The most immediate outcome of this work was that Roebuck was convinced of the ‘justness of the Principles of the engine, encouraging him to invest further and, in return for an agreement that he would receive two-thirds of any income derived from the project, he paid for Watt to obtain a patent on the separate condenser
 With the patent obtained, Watts tests on a full-size version of his engine continued at Kinneil until April 1770
 In October 1768 he recorded his ‘natural inactivity, want of health & resolution
 As Roebucks coal mines filled with water, and his money seeped away, Watt faced a dilemma
 In the nine years from 1765 until 1774, he spent only two periods of three years in total, in 1765–6 and 1768–70, actually working on the engine
 As we will see, when Watt did grasp the internal workings of the engine, he saw it as a chemical machine
 The scope of Watts chemical interests is indicated by the con- tents of his workshop, which is a veritable storehouse of practical chemistry
 ‘Benzoin, Epsom salts and ‘Chinese Carthamus had medicinal uses, reflecting Watts role as family doctor as well as husband and father
 Watts workshop, Birmingham, 1924
 That is not to say, however, that Watts chemical interests were not philosophical
 Similarly, Joseph Blacks lectures were written, according to John Robison, ‘in the clearest, simplest, and most intelligible >>>>>> Language; such that any sensible dyer or Blacksmith or druggist will understand completely – yet Black was also regarded as the foremost chemical philosopher of his time
 The Delftfield Pottery had been established by four business partners in 1748, and was based just west of Glasgow city centre, quite close to the Broomielaw (1)(2) Its original product was Delft - ware, clay fired in a kiln at relatively low temperature which was allowed to cool off and then dipped in a glossy white tin glaze
 Even as the Delftfield Pottery was founded, the popularity of Delftware was beginning to wane
 There were two possible paths that Watt could pursue: to make Chinese porcelain or improve Britains existing domestic pottery
 Learning the secrets of this manufac - turing process was a project played out across Europe: it was first mastered in Dresden in 1709 under conditions of tremendous secrecy, and became a preserve of royal factories making luxurious tablewares for monarchs and their courts
 The alternative to a new domestic porcelain industry was to develop the already extant British earthenware trade
 But earthenwares evolved quickly to ultimately produce a new ware described by John Aikin in 1795 as ‘the source of a very extensive trade, [which] may be ranked amongst the most important manufactures of the kingdom: creamware
 Creamware imitated porcelain in appearance but took advan - tage of locally available materials and techniques
 The name most closely associated with this new trade was that of Josiah (1)(2) He devoted enormous efforts to establishing the scientific basis for its manufacture: it took 411 attempts to obtain the perfect chemical recipe for his creamware glaze, for example
 Watts experiments on the bodies of his pottery wares were diverse
 These experiments came alongside development of dense and imperme- able new ‘stoneware products, and the workshop also contains a whole drawer of small test firings of pieces of cream-coloured clay, accompanied by notes from Watt recording that they were fired ‘by 55 degrees and ‘by 80 degrees of ‘Wedgwoods thermometer
 In sourcing these materials, Watts often peripatetic life, travelling on business, paid dividends: he found good-quality killas clay near Falmouth in 1782, and his workshop contains a wooden box filled with mineral samples, as well as a small amount of ‘Asbestus in rock form, and even three human teeth and part of a jawbone, with a note that they were from the battle of ‘Louearly Field fought 1160
 While travelling to Birmingham in 1774, Watt also conscientiously noted that the ‘stone grows softer and gravel harder; he certainly developed a canny eye for potentially useful materials to employ at (1)(2)
 The success of Watts chemical work is suggested by the Scottish potter Robert Muirhead, who described one of his recipes for a fine, white glaze as ‘an entirely new art >>>>>> not discovered & practised by any other persons in Britain
 Turning the clay and glaze ingredients into a finished product depended on them being fired in a kiln, and Watt turned his atten- tion to this, too
 He changed the shape and internal layout of the kilns so they became more evenly heated, replaced wood fuel with cheaper coke or coal, and changed how the kilns furnace was stoked with fuel to reduce smoke and prevent ashes contaminating the wares
 Watts work on the Delftfield kilns, the better to bake hard the clay wares and finish the glazes, is a reminder that understanding the nature of heat, and how best to manipulate it, was a central concern to all those engaged in chemistry
 Watts developing understanding of the steam engine when he eventually returned to it
 Rather than being a form of energy, Watt and his col- leagues regarded heat as a chemical compound of heat and water
 This interpretation of the engine, rather than placing a division between Watts work on the engine and, say, his research at the Delft - field pottery, sees them as closely related
 In estab- lishing how different fuels heated the kilns, for example, Black helped Watt with a vivid description: ‘A kiln which is heated with flaming fuel may be said to be heated by means of a torrent of liquid fire which flows through it, but I am persuaded that cokes act mostly by radiation like that of the sun
 If Watts working practices at Delftfield were informed by strong philosophical elements, as seems likely, then he was not alone
 Pottery was recognized as offering excellent opportunities ‘for the exercise of ingenuity and research and was an attractive career for ‘persons of observant habits
 And the close integration of theory and practice that pottery relied upon suggests the existence of a shared set of practices and concerns for chemists of all backgrounds
 The furnace was at the heart of much activity in philosophical laboratories
 One author noted that ‘a complete furnace, capable of being worked in a parlour chimney, may be had, which will create little trouble, and will require no assistance from the bricklayer
 Just as the laboratory chemist spent much time labouring over the furnace, so great ‘bottle kilns, named after their shape, loomed large in the working lives of potters
 But other products, including the creamware, were referred to only as ‘biscuitware after its first firing because of the colour, poros ity and absorbent qualities attained
 All applications of heat shared the problem of how precisely to measure the temperatures attained
 & that only by such a degree of variation in the fire as scarcely affected our creamcolour bisket at all
 Accurately gauging temperature by eye under these conditions was a skill only obtained by hard-won experience over a period of years
 The problem of measuring temperatures was solved in philo- sophical chemistry by, for instance, using thermometers of the type made by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit from 1724, or by Anders Celsius from 1742
 However, delicate glass-and-mercury thermometers would not survive for long in a pottery kiln, where temperatures routinely passed above 1,000°c
 Wedgwoods pyrometer embodies an interest in attaining the highest possible levels of precision across chemical experiments and processes
 milli - grams
 There was now a move towards carefully obtaining the best available; Wedgwood specified precisely that clay obtained from Pensacola in North America ‘must be got as clean from soil, as if it was to be eat, & if they were to get several parcels, at different depths, & put them in separate Casks, properly numberd, I could by that means easily ascertain what depth of the mine is best for our purpose
 And chemists could play a key role in validating the quality of such materials; as William Cullen wrote, ‘the philosophical chemist is the assay master to arts in general
 Although new means of precision measurement were becom- ing available, their use required more trust to be placed in those instruments than their users were sometimes willing to give
 In his ‘Brief Analysis of Water by Precipitants (1810), A Wedgwood pyrometer set, 1786
 George Smith describes how ‘Good water has no smell; such as abounds in aerial acid, diffuses a penetrating odour
 Taste was also employed: Acid occasions a gentle pungent acescent taste; a bitterness accompanies those waters which contain >>>>>> nitre, or magnesia; a slight austerity proceeds from lime and gypsum; a sweet astringency from alum; a saltishness from common salt; a lixivious flavour from alkali; a bitter astringency from copper; and an inky taste from iron
 When Watt and Black corresponded about corrosion inside a pumping engine caused by the water, Black concluded that ‘the Water >>>>>> contains a quantity of fixed air tho only a small quantity >>>>>> it is perceptible by >>>>>> a person who has a delicate taste
 In this respect the experience in pottery matched that in philo- sophical chemistry
 Pressing delicate relief detail, handles and decorations onto a piece of pottery without applying too much pres- sure took a well-trained, delicate touch
 This is not entirely to play down the role of new chemical equip- ment
 And the capabilities of industrial workshop practice impinged directly onto the manu- facture of some experimental apparatus
 Just as there were extensive crossovers between the practices of philosophical and industrial chemistry, so the equipment used by Watt and Black in their experiments on heat bridged both worlds
 But in addition to these, he employed readily available chemical balances to measure the amount of fuel burned and water evapor - ated, thermometers and barometers for measuring temperature and air pressure and, most prosaic of all, a ‘common tea kitchen to generate steam for his experiments, while Blacks laboratory at Glasgow ‘extended little beyond basic apparatus such as furnaces, stills and glassware
 To summarize, then, chemistry in many areas of experimenta- tion and application was based on the accurate manipulation and measurement of heat
 Though these developments were played out in potteries and chemical laboratories, they were of profound signifi- cance to the development of the steam engine, and the key players in realizing this were Black and (1)(2) Having outlined how heat was seen as a chemical substance by both men, and their contem- poraries, we will assess their perceptions of its properties and how they could be applied to the engine
 Although their philosophies of the chemical nature of heat were similar, Black and Watt approached the nature of heat from subtly different starting points – Watt with the particular objective of mak- ing the engine work, and Black from the perspective of explaining philosophically how a substance absorbs heat
 But this is not to say that the two had a ‘master and pupil relation- ship
 The historian Arthur Donovan claimed that Blacks move from Glasgow to take up a post at the University of Edinburgh in 1766 was ‘the end of his career as a creative philosophical chemist
 Black wrote to Watt in March 1772, ‘I have no chemical news, my attempts in Chemistry at present are chiefly directed to the exhibition of Processes and experiments for my Lectures, which require more time and trouble than one would imagine
 As he later wrote, ‘I, having become the father of a family, and loaded with cares of many kinds, had less time for mere philoso - phical conversations
 Black had begun his research on heat in 1755 when he was first appointed to the college at (1)(2) It is traditionally said that he first turned to heat as a fruitful area of research after considering that snow is not melted instantly on a sunny winters day but lingers for some time, and that an overnight frost does not immediately cause ice to form – both phenomena that would be widely visible during a Glaswegian winter
 Black called this considerable increment the ices latent heat
 Watts experiments with engines led him to similar conclusions
 Steam was injected beneath it, and the piston rose
 As for the amount of steam required being considerably more than the volume of the cylinder, this brings us to the capacity a body has to absorb heat, or its specific heat
 A long series of experiments with his model and prototype engines showed Watt that excessive steam consumption was caused not, as he initially thought, by heat escap- ing through the cylinder walls, but by the metal cylinder itself having to be warmed prior to every working stroke
 The nature of specific heat had also been explored through smaller-scale experimental means
 Scottish physician George Martine had also found that when two glasses of equal volume, one containing water and the other mercury, were placed in front of a fire, the temperature of the mercury rose faster
 Watts responses to the nature of specific and latent heat shaped the design of his steam engine
 With the benefit of hindsight, we can say that Watt had grasped the principle which every condensing steam engine subsequently built would depend on
 With progress made in his understanding of the engine, the way forward for Watt lay in refining it as a truly practical industrial machine
 A brief surge in production and speculation was followed by realization that new markets for extra output were not emerging as quickly as hoped, a glut of unsold goods, falling prices and the collapse of economic confidence
 With the finances of the engine project uncertain, Watt also faced changes in his personal life
 Travelling on business in Scotlands Great Glen during September 1773, Watt received a desperate letter: his wife was expecting a child and was dangerously ill
 The child had been delivered stillborn, and Peggy, his wife, had died afterwards
 Its physical size was matched by its cost – £2,000 in total,2 or over £125,000 in todays money – and by the impressiveness of its operation
 The engine built by Watt as business partner to Matthew Boulton of Birmingham was a landmark machine in the history of the Industrial Revolution and, in the aspirations for how it would be constructed, was unlike anything that had gone before
 Here we will explore how the engines development played out within the context of the city of Birmingham, its environment and culture, Matthew Boulton and his Soho Manufactory, and the manufacture of one of Birmingham and Boultons most important product lines: buttons
 First and foremost, the engine was a product of the metalwork- ing capabilities of the city of (1)(2) In the eighteenth century Birmingham had the largest concentration anywhere of expertise in metal manufacturing
 This centrepiece of Birminghams manufactures played a prominent role in the history of the steam engine
 descendants
 As a metalworking centre Birmingham was home to over 50 dis- tinct trades, and this unprecedented concentration of industry attracted visitors anxious to see the sights
 And Robert Southey was ‘dizzied with the hammering of presses, the clatter of engines, and the whirling of wheels >>>>>> the devil has certainly fixed upon this spot for his own nursery-garden and hot-house
 These conditions, so vividly imprinted on the memory of those who witnessed them, were the product of an industrial culture that emphasized the transformation of ideas into practical schemes
 The lecturer John Warltire ran courses in metallurgy and mineralogy, as well as providing tuition in the scientific method
 in Britain except London – until 1819, Birmingham men took out three patents for every one acquired in that other great manufac- turing town, (1)(2)11 William Hutton could with some justifi- cation write of Birmingham that he ‘was surprised at the place, but more so at the people
 At the forefront of Birminghams industries stood Matthew (1)(2) Born in 1728, he took over and expanded the family business working in the ‘toy trade
 The trade was immensely valuable: John Taylor and Samuel Garbett, two of the other leading toymakers, claimed in 1759 that their output was worth £600,000 every year – about £45 million in todays money – and Edmund Burke christened Birmingham the ‘Toyshop of Europe
 By 1768 Boultons business was prominent enough for him to be described as the ‘most complete manufacturer in England, in metal
 A single pat- tern book from 1775–90 catalogues over 1,400 different product designs being made
 Boultons success was also based on an astonishing ability to network and exploit the connections of the world of polite commerce
 He showed visitors around Soho himself, and Samuel Johnson recalled ‘Tuesday Sept(1)th [1774] >>>>>> went to Boultons who with great civility, led us through his shops >>>>>> Twelve dozen of buttons for three shillings
 In his diary for another day, Boulton recalled: We had Prince Poniatowski, the nephew of the King of Poland, the French, the Danish, the Sardinian, and ye Dutch Ambassadors >>>>>> and only yesterday I had the Viceroy of (1)(2) Not a day passes but we have some Nobleman or other
 Boultons friend William Small jested with him about his networking prowess: ‘I hope the King and Royal Family, the nobility and the Ministry and your other friends are well
 With his manufacturing capabilities, and the networks of con- tacts at his disposal, Boulton was ‘an iron chieftain, and >>>>>> a father to his tribe
 Even as he consolidated his reputation, and moved in increasingly exalted circles, Boultons business finances staggered from one crisis to another
 To stabilize his finances, Boulton needed a new, successful business opportunity
 He offered Boulton a licence to make engines for the Midlands, but Boulton turned him down, commenting, ‘It would not be worth my while to make for three counties only, but I find it very worth while to make for all the world
 With his boldness and connections, Boulton was the perfect partner for the more retiring (1)(2) James Keir reflected that ‘his successes and his failures were all on a grand scale, and he certainly strove to ensure the engine was successful, engaging in detail with how it would be made
 As Watt had his leap of the imagination in devising the separate condenser, here was Boultons equivalent: to precisely make engines en masse, just like making buttons
 The manufacture of buttons was, like many of Birminghams other products, driven by the demands of fashion
 From reaching the height of their popularity in the 1780s, the vagaries of taste meant that, by 1791, 20,000 people working in the buckle trade were petitioning the Prince of Wales claiming distress
, with a mass of steel buttons effacing his coat, and one even incongruously taped to the top of his hat
 To satiate the heavy demand for buttons, their manufacture very quickly developed into a carefully organized and efficient process, which became one of the highlights of (1)(2) Abraham Rees wrote that there was ‘no manufacture which includes such an infinite variety of operations as that of the button-maker; it employed ‘a little Army of all ages, and the scene of them hard at work was, for Jabez Maud Fisher, ‘too great for (1)(2) Tis wonderful, astonishing, amazing
 But out of these the most popular was steel – so popular, in fact, that often cheaper glass was polished up to imitate it
 There was also a trade in old sword blades and even horseshoe nails, which would be used for the tiny studs in steel buttons
 Turning this steel into the finished product took a whole range of techniques, which were perfect candidates for the application of simple machine tools like presses, stamps and lathes
 First, a ‘blank for each button was ‘Button Maker, from The Book of Trades (1824)
 cut out of a sheet of metal using the fly-press
 Press workers were in almost perpetual motion, swinging the flys (the large, weighted levers that gave the press its working impetus) from 14,000 to 20,000 strokes a day
 With the buttons shape and decoration finished, it would need mounting on a ‘shank, a shallow hook, so it could be fixed to clothing
 But all the equipment of button making was capable of high precision: drop stamps had a catch which secured the upper die after it had fallen, to avoid it bouncing and damaging the button, and the lower die was accurately positioned by four screw adjusters
 Choreographing all these techniques required careful organ- ization, and each worker came to be an expert in a single, tiny part of the overall process
 Although the division of labour was extreme, there was still some latitude for those involved to exercise considerable artistic skill, or educated art, as in closing, tool making, burnishing, and in the turning of pearl and other buttons, and where so high a degree of workmanship is not necessary, there is still a certain variety of labour and careful attention to be given to it that involve some exercise of the mind as well as the mere physique >>>>>> so that a certain kind of sharpening of the wits goes on, more than exists in many other kinds of labour
 Some button makers estimated that this way of working was twenty times faster than when each individual item was made by a single worker
 The button making workforce consisted of men, women and children
 How long their hands remained delicate while being immersed in metal oxides and alcoholic proof spirit is questionable
 Button making contributed, then, to the industrious atmosphere of Soho that so exhilarated visitors
 This is how Boulton systematized the button manufactory
 The basics of engine manufacturing were well established
 This was broadly the path Boulton & Watt followed, albeit with some significant differences
 Importantly, then, beyond the very specialized parts like the ‘nozzles, which controlled the flow of steam in and out of the cylinder, Boulton & Watt did relatively little of the physical work of engine-building themselves
 This was a canny move: the partners realized that manufacturing Watts improved engine and exploiting it commercially were not necessarily the same thing
 The latter, obtaining revenues from the engines users, was where the potential profits were
 What, then, of assembling engines like buttons
 ‘Making engines like buttons was a statement of intent, perhaps intended to overawe his competitors
 This complexity dogged Boulton & Watt from the start because of the location of most of their likely customers
 Boulton & Watt offered an ideal solution to the difficulties faced
 While we have considered the actions of steam and heat inside the engine, we have not yet explored the engine as a physical artefact that had to safely and efficiently exploit those properties, the construc - tion of which was the major challenge that now confronted Boulton & (1)(2) The engines they made were big ‘house-built machines, working inside a building that provided support to the major com- ponents, and mainly used to pump water for canals, mines and water supply
 Now Boulton, Watt and their workforce faced the demands of making a similar-sized machine requiring the precision of instrument making
 Watts single-acting pumping engine for draining mines, 1788, as drawn in John Fareys Treatise on the Steam Engine (1827)
 Much of each engine was made of timber
 Indeed it can be said to be hardly capable of preserving its identity
 So, there was some impetus to use different or new materials
 And it was iron that became the engineers main material
 Take casting iron, for instance
 The pattern makers tools were similar to those used in fine joinery or cabinetmaking, and he worked in deal, pine or mahogany, carefully dried so that it would not warp, screwing the pieces of wood together so they could be easily altered if need be and using a plane for fine adjustments
 The pattern maker had to understand the entire casting process: he had to avoid sharp internal corners, which could lead to cracks in the cooling metal, and surfaces were always tapered, not quite parallel or square; if they were, there was a worse chance that they would stick in the sand mould, damaging its surfaces
 The patterns would be placed in huge beds of sand, which was packed around them so that, when they were lifted out, a perfect negative copy was left behind for molten metal to be poured into
 But the composition of the sand was critical, and depended on the moulders skill: it needed to be damp, or ‘green, to form a good impression, but this carried the risk of an explosion if the molten metal contacted too much moisture, or, if gases could not escape, a ‘blown casting with areas of spongy, porous metal that would be much weaker than the sur- rounding material
 Alongside casting, forging the iron to shape was an important part of steam engine construction
 He is pouring molten iron from a ladle into a box mould for making small castings
 iron from Wednesbury or ‘the best gun barrel iron
 Forging these bars to the required shapes needed the use of a smiths furnace to raise them to the right temperature, from a black-red just visible in daylight, to a bright red at which most work was performed, and white-hot and burning with vivid sparks for welding pieces of iron together
 These three main processes were central to the manufacture of many parts of the engine, and would have comprised much of the work carried out at (1)(2) The centrepiece of the Engine Manufactory was a blacksmiths shop with two great hearths for heating the iron, and at least one lathe – probably a great lathe with a hand capstan to drive it, given the size of some of the components that might be turned there: the largest of these might be the piston rod that attached the engine piston to the beam
 At the other end of the scale of forge-work came the making of smaller items like nuts and bolts, demonstrating the versatility of the smith engaged in engine manufacture
 With foundry and forge work highly dependent on the hand skills of the foundryman, pattern maker or smith, the only part of the engine that required a dedicated, highly accurate machine tool was the cylinder
 that were a close fit to each other; if there was any gap between the two, steam would leak through and the engine would come to a halt
 Finally, the piston had rope wrapped around its circum - ference, compressed tight by a ‘junk ring, and this worked well
 But the best strategy was to make the cylinder as accurately as possible and, for this, Watt depended on the ingenuity of John Wilkinson who, in 1775, made a cylinder-boring machine
 The degree of accuracy Wilkinson acquired using A model of John Wilkinsons mill for boring steam engine cylinders, 1775
 this machine was unequalled in its time; Watt boasted that ‘Mr Wilkinson has bored us several cylinders almost without error, that of 50 in
 Here was precision manufacturing scaled up from scientific instruments to steam engines
 Having made the unfinished components, and the cylinder, it was now time to fit them together
 As far as possible, heavy parts like cylinders were moved by water, from Birmingham by canal, from Wilkinsons Bersham works via the River Severn, and then around the coast until as close the final destination as possible
 The arrival of all the parts on site marked the first time the complete engine would have been united at a single location
 Erecting the engine was not just a matter of final assembly, but of completing a major part of the actual manufacturing process
 The opportunities for injury reflected the nature of the engine- erecting process
 Much of the fitters work would be con- cerned with the accurate cutting and shaping of metal components using a range of basic hand tools: hammers, chisels, files and drills
 If a lot of metal had to be removed, huge ‘flogging chisels, over a foot long, were used, with one man gripping the chisel in both hands and another wielding a sledgehammer
 Botallack was famous for its precarious position, and the workings extended some way under the sea
 off and causing injury
 Even in the 1820s, the cost of producing a perfectly flat cast-iron surface was twelve shillings per square foot – one of Boulton & Watts engine erectors in Cornwall might earn nine shillings per week
 Drilling holes in metal was equally time-consuming and labour- intensive
 The brace would turn a flat drill rather than the spiral fluted twist drill used today; the flat drill had a pair of cutting edges meeting in a point, and worked not by cutting the metal but by scraping it
 Watt would have been acquainted with the techniques of foundry, forge and fitting even before he began his partnership with (1)(2) From 1765, as well as making scientific instruments in Glasgow, and his experimental engine at Kinneil, he had built a small number of atmospheric engines for customers in (1)(2) And as the engine grew from a benchtop model to an industrial machine, Watt grew as well, noting in 1769, ‘I am not the same person I was four years ago when I invented the fire engine >>>>>> the necessary experience in great was wanting; for acquiring it I have met with many disappoint - ments
 Such were the calls on his time and expertise that he wrote to Boulton in February 1778: ‘I fancy I must be cut in pieces and a portion sent to every tribe in (1)(2)
 Matthew Boulton was also heavily engaged in (1)(2) He rolled up his sleeves and dived into the fray, writing to Watt that ‘of all the toys and trinkets which are manufactured at Soho, none shall take the place of fire engines in respect of my attention
 Presently Boulton and Watt appointed William Murdoch as their chief representative in Cornwall, his technical skill and ability to take on fractious Cornish miners with his fists if so required – an option hardly open to the reticent Watt – giving him considerable authority, and freeing Boulton and Watt for other activities
 For Watt this meant working at his home in Birmingham with an assistant on calculations, correspondence and drawings, and only occasionally venturing onto the shop floor
 So Boulton & Watts men tended to be jacks of all trades, and they were expected to excel in all of them, producing ‘the well-known “Soho workmen”, whose services were sought directly or indirectly wherever their fame had spread
 This comes with a caveat, however
 For example, William Murdoch had quickly become Boulton & Watts leading pattern maker before being sent to Cornwall, and there his abilities led him to make small, largely unauthorized adjustments to the engines as they were built – often to Watts irritation
 First came new paper systems
 It was intended to counter a steady flow of enquiries from engine men working across the country, and came with printed checklists of engine components to use when work - ing on site – Watt later used spare copies to wrap up delicate items in his workshop
 Of particular importance was Watts method of letter copying
 Its working premise was simple: a letter was written using ink specially formulated by (1)(2) Then thin copy- ing paper was laid over the top, and both were squeezed between rollers, after which the duplicate could be read through the back of the thin copy-paper
 Boulton and Watt formed a subsidiary company marketing the press to others; 630 were sold in its first year
 Paper processes were matched by technical improvements to the engine itself
 Boulton realized that other- wise, ‘if any misfortune should happen and, for example, the pump- ing engine for a mine was halted, floodwater might drown the workings, which ‘might be ruined before a piston rod could be made
 Even a standard design of engine house was adopted
 Two have reinforcing wooden ‘queen posts and iron Roller press for copying letters, by (1) Watt & Co, 1818
 straps, together with over-scale hooks or rings to hang weights on, and the other two are wooden latticeworks, one of which actually broke during the course of experiments
 Finally, making measurements associated with the engine led to the development of new precision instruments
 Despite their best efforts they made very little money from the former: just a few late-arriving components, or a faulty casting, could turn a profitable job into a loss-making one
 use, initially a flat rate based on the saving in coal fuel consumed
 Boulton complained: ‘It is rather hard to work without profit and then not get paid
 It is tempting to say that Boultons declaration that he was making engines like buttons was canny marketing
 Boulton created what we will call a ‘dispersed factory, and it was what a business analyst today might call ‘scaleable: once the basic infrastructure was in place, it could be expanded as circum - stances dictated, without a detrimental effect on Boulton & Watts core interests
 By 1800 Boulton & Watt had built 440 engines, each of which, with its attendant boilers for raising steam, was the size of a modern detached house
 We can close this chapter in Watts career by returning to those practical matters which took up so much of his time, and that of his colleagues
 First, just as Watt was intrigued by heat, and measured it with thermometers, mechanics used heat to work metal, and measured it by the metals colour
 Heat was as much a mechanics practical tool as a subject of philosophical research
 Further, as measuring heat depended on the visual acuity of the smith, the potter or chemist, and the latter two employed their senses of smell and taste in pursuing experiments with chemical substances, so the sense of touch was essential to accurate metalworking
 The accuracy of a metalworkers output depended on being able to maintain exact angles, and not accidentally rounding off corners
 Second, making early engines depended on exercising craft skills, which in turn depended on simple hand tools made of steel as the principal available means of shaping metal

 early supremacy in making machines
 Third, just as Watts work on the engine was driven by his moral dislike of wasting steam, so the engines design and construction was driven by minimizing the effort used in making its component parts
 Later Watt developed his ‘parallel motion to connect the piston rod to the end of the beam, even though the former went up and down perpendicularly while the latter scribed an arc in the air
 Lastly, the presence of so much woodwork is a reminder that, although the engine became the emblematic machine of the new industrial age, it was being built in advance of many of the other industrial machines which would have assisted in its production
 In a way that is Watts character coming across in the technology he helped create
 As for steam, we leave it at an important crossroads: in time engines would be made in the same way as buttons, but that was a little way in the future
 Watt wrote of his first Cornish engine at Wheal Bussy, Chacewater, that ‘all the world is Agog to see its performance
 Within six years Boulton & Watts machine had almost entirely dis- placed the old atmospheric engine in (1)(2) The resources avail- able to make engines were sparse and the machinery was imperfect compared with later models, but in Cornwall, with its dense network of mines and workings, 52 engines had been built by 1800, along with 30 constructed by other engineers
 It was a portent of things to come
 five Steam Mill Mad
 The city of Manchester divided opinion
 Manchester was the city that set the benchmark for Britains new industrial towns, and the material that formed its primary prod- uct has also become an emblem of Britains Industrial Revolution: cotton
 The foundry yard is full of cast iron engine components, awaiting dispatch to customers
 of possibilities to drive production
 With their backgrounds in constructing water mills and clocks, these craftsmen also played a part in keeping industry small, but perfectly formed
 Manchester was well placed to capitalize on the cotton trade
 Josiah Tucker wrote in 1782 that ‘silks, cottons and linens, combined in a thousand forms, and diversified by names without number, are now almost the universal wear
 Part of cottons attraction was its versatility
 This versatility made cotton a sought-after, fashion- able material
 The name indelibly linked with cotton manufacture is that of Richard (1)(2) Described by Thomas Carlyle as a ‘plain, almost gross, bag-cheeked, pot-bellied Lancashire man, he was trained as a barber in Preston, Lancashire, and most likely became acquainted with the developing cotton industry as he travelled collecting hair Margaret Bryan, astronomer and physicist, and her daughters, as portrayed in Bryans book A Compendious System of Astronomy (1797)
 to make wigs
 Archibald Buchanan, who lived with him for a time, recalled that he was ‘so intent on his schemes that they ‘often sat for weeks together, on opposite sides of the fire without exchanging a syllable
 Arkwrights success was based on a new type of cotton-spinning machine
 The drafting rollers are at the top of the machine, and the flyers at the bottom
 pulled the cotton fibres straight and parallel, before a ‘flyer rotating at high speed twisted them together into a single thread
 Having built his first mill in at Nottingham, he constructed others in Derbyshire, most notably at Cromford, and at New Lanark near (1)(2) He also licensed other spinners to use the machines as long as they did so in units capable of spinning 1,000 threads simultaneously
 Arkwrights conceptualization of the factory certainly caught the imaginations of many of his contemporaries
 Jabez Maud Fisher had earlier written of Cromford that the way ‘the [water]wheel sets in motion many thousands of others; and the Sight of all this variety of motion is the most pleasing imaginable, and that it was ‘the Greatest Curiosity in the Mechanical Work in Great Britain
 How Boulton & Watt competed, and against whom, will be considered next
 The early 1780s were busy for Boulton & (1)(2) They were building steam engines to pump water from mines, and customers in Cornwall demanded their full attention
 He told Watt, ‘The people in London, Manchester, & Birmingham are Steam Mill Mad, & therefore let us be wise & take ye advantage
 Watts interest in engines that would produce a turning motion – called rotary or rotative engines – was long-standing [illus(1)]
 Therefore let us make hay while the sun shines
 Watt was initially reluctant
 In December 1779 Watt was exploring the use of a crank – already widely used to drive grind- stones, potters wheels and foot lathes
 on the flywheel
 Of these the most successful of all was the brain- child of Watts assistant William Murdoch, the ‘sun and planet gear
 The sun and planet gear offered a credible way for Boulton & Watt to build a rotative beam engine, and they patented it in 1781
 This model was used by Boulton & Watt to guide the development of the full-size version for the rotative engine
 engine that they developed and attained patent protection for during the 1780s
 The final major improvement was to find a new way of attaching the piston to the beam
 The first of Boulton & Watts rotative engines set running outside Soho was built for John Wilkinson in 1783, and by 1800, they had built 278 as opposed to 171 pumping engines
 Customers included lead works, rope works, malt distilleries, sugar, tobacco and snuff manufactories, druggists, rolling mills, forges and foundries, glazers, bark and cork mills, even a mustard manufacturer
 But not all was as the raw numbers suggest
 Potential customers power requirements varied considerably
 Overwhelmingly the demand for power – of any type, steam or water – was for small units
 It was common, where a large mill building was constructed, only to grad - ually fill it with machinery, or even sublet space to different companies, offering ‘room and power in return for rent
 So, potential customers for their rotative engine wanted power, if they wanted it at all, on a small scale
 Watts rotative engine, as built by him from 1787 until 1800; illustration from John Fareys Treatise on the Steam Engine (1827)
 Many prospective customers were also very timid in their approach to power
 They could be led astray by engine builders like the two Matthew Boulton described as ‘drunken, idle, stupid, careless, conceited rascals [who] say, and their masters seem to believe, that it required the learning and knowledge of a University man to keep an engine in order
 Often that alternative was a variant of Newcomens atmospheric engine
 In advance of developing their sun and planet engine, even Boulton & Watts ‘Old Bess engine was used at their Soho Manufactory to recirculate water over a wheel, and John Wilkinson had one at his ironworks, ‘an engine of great magnitude which brought up the contents of the river as it were at one stroke, that ‘shook the buildings and ground for a considerable distance
 Further, waterwheels remained a serious proposition for many prospective customers
 The same year that Watt patented his separate condenser, 1769, John Smeaton was beginning to apply cast-iron compon ents to a wheel at the Carron Foundry in Scotland, which was ‘found to answer much better than wooden ones and was ‘constantly recommended afterwards by Mr Smeaton for other mills which he designed, and by degrees came into very general use
 A waterwheel like that installed at Arkwrights Cromford mill might generate 12 horsepower but, by 1800, wheels of 80 horsepower were in use
 These developments reduced the incentive to adopt steam power
 If they wished to purchase an engine, customers need not turn just to Boulton & Watt: there were many other competing firms
 In Manchester the company of Bateman & Sherratt was acknowledged as having ‘very ingenious and able engineers who built engines that were ‘of a small size, very compact, stand in a small space, work smooth and easy, and are scarcely heard in the build- ing where erected
 As in scientific instrument making, there was room alongside the very best for those building machines that were just sufficient for the job in hand
 It is telling, then, that Manchester writer John Aikin recorded that only ‘some few [engines] are also erected in this neighbourhood by Messrs Bolton and Watts [sic]
 So, although Matthew Boulton predicted that rotative engines presented ‘a field that is boundless, this declaration did not neces - sarily transpose into orders for engines
 Out of more than 2,000 engines built in Britain by 1800, two-thirds were of the older atmospheric type, and Boulton & Watt built only one- quarter
 One of visitors abiding memories of Manchester was its ‘dark black smoaky atmosphere, the product of a growing number of chimneys, each connected to a boiler for raising steam
 Together they supplied the town with a constant fug of smoke, ‘an inky canopy which seemed to embrace and involve the entire place
 Alongside the polluted atmosphere, Manchester at street level must have been an assault on visitors senses; in 1835 Alexis de Tocqueville described ‘the crunching wheels of machinery, the shriek of steam from boilers, the regular beat of the looms, the heavy rumble of carts as ‘the noises from which you can never escape in the sombre half- light of these streets
 If the external effects of engines were the subject of negative comment, the machinery inside, by comparison, left a very favourable impression on those who saw it
 In 1786 Joseph Smith & Robert Peel of Manchester summed up the main advantage of the English cotton trade as arising ‘from our machines both for spinning and printing; by means of these we can spin both cheaper and better, and we can print >>>>>> cheaper and better
 Britain became the worlds principal textile manufacturer by solving the mechanical problems of production – and that was most evident among the whirring shafts and spinning flyers inside the mills
 A question arises, then, over who the people were to best deliver this modern, mechanical world
 A vivid description of the millwright has been provided by William (1)(2) He characterized the millwright as a ‘jack-of-all-trades, who could with equal facility work at the lathe, the anvil, or the carpenters bench >>>>>> he thus gained the character of an ingenious, roving, rollicking blade, able to turn his hand to anything
 Millwrighting was originally a peripatetic job, and millwrights, ‘like other wandering tribes >>>>>> went about the country from mill to mill, with the old song of “kettles to mend” reapplied to the more important fractures of machinery
 Fairbairn was apprenticed to the Northumberland millwright John Robinson, who maintained all the machines working at a colliery and who, perhaps because of his wide responsibilities, had a ‘rough, passionate temper and ‘indulged in >>>>>> profane swearing, carried to such an excess that an order was scarcely once given unless accompanied by an oath
 Such men, at once foul-mouthed, belligerent and highly skilled, found themselves drawn in two directions
 In these places the millwright became sub - sumed into the machine making profession alongside engineers, turners and fitters, working alongside carpenters, wheelwrights, cabinetmakers, joiners, smiths, clockmakers and others attracted from their original trades by better wages
 The millwrights particular job was to construct the shafts and wheels known as ‘mill-work, needed to couple a power source to the production machinery
 Fairbairn recalls rising with the sun in summer, and some hours before it in the winter >>>>>> For the remainder of the day I had either to draw out the work, or to ride fifteen or sixteen miles on a hired hack to consult with proprietors, take dimensions, and arrange the principle and plan on which the work was to be constructed
 Practical work was matched by skill at negotiation and draughts- manship as well
 All was underpinned by the millwrights ability to manipulate materials
 Wood began to be replaced with metal to better withstand the higher speeds at which the machinery was required to operate; bulky millwork was shrunk, the ‘ponderous masses of wood, cast iron, and their enormous bearings and couplings giving way to ‘slender rods of wrought iron and light frames or hooks for sus- pending them, [and] pulleys and straps of moderate diameters and dimensions
 So, the means of building the internal systems of a mill were provided by the millwright, using many of the techniques used to construct engines that we have earlier discussed
 As the eighteenth century progressed, and possession of a time- keeper became as much a mark of social standing as it was a record of timekeeping per se, horology was a growing trade
 These factors attracted James Watt, who took an interest in clockmaking alongside his other Thomas Allom, Swainson Birley cotton mill near Preston, Lancashire, 1834
 The machinery seen in this view, used to prepare the cotton for spinning, is driven by the belts and shafts suspended from the ceiling above
 ‘The Watch Maker, from The Book of Trades (1824)
 projects
 And even before that, in 1758, Watt was in partnership with Joseph Black and Alexander Wilson to make clocks – his workshop contains an incomplete timepiece movement and a number of unfinished clockwheels that may date from this period
 How clockmaking was organized varied across (1)(2) At one end of the scale were the makers based in (1)(2) The metropolis was home to a complex trade exporting finished clocks all over the world, comprising large numbers of specialized workers – Abraham Rees counted up to eighteen different trades – movement makers, spring makers, enamellers, brass founders and more
 In contrast to the London trade stood those making clocks who might have been trained as blacksmiths and in associated trades, build ing locks or even firearms
 These clocks were accurate timepieces but, owing to their physical size, their construction owed as much to the blacksmith as to the bench-based clockmaker
 The nature of the clocksmiths workshop reflected their combin - ation of skills
 The bench would be positioned close to the window and, if very small work was carried out there regularly, might have a groove along its front and ‘wings around the sides to catch com pon ents rolling off
 The presence of the forge is a reminder of the need to heat materials so that they could be shaped
 The plates would then be hammered flat using a round-faced planishing hammer to avoid leaving sharp indentations before hand-filing to a smooth finish: brass can be ‘work-hardened – that is, the more it is worked, with a hammer, file or in the lathe, the tougher it becomes
 The clocksmith had to carefully consider the relationship between these different materials
 Although it was less easily shaped than brass, steel was cheaper: in the early eighteenth century it might cost one penny per pound compared to ten pence for brass
 Alongside tools like hammers and files, which might be found across a variety of trades, clocksmiths were early in adopting special-purpose tools
 In a relatively small movement, these wheels were often stamped out of brass: material was removed to save weight, leaving spokes behind
 The complex processes of clockmaking produced, and attracted, self-sufficient and innovative craftsmen
 In 1741 the clockmaker Henry Hindley of York showed the engineer John Smeaton a screw-cutting lathe and a wheel-cutting machine he had constructed – both of which were later to be widely adopted in industry
 These examples show that there were extensive connections between clockmaking and larger-scale engineering, and this was widely commented upon by contemporaries
 The Manchester Mercury newspaper in the 1780s and 90s contains a series of advertisements for clockmakers to work in cotton mills and with machine makers to ‘fitt up the clock work for mules and water machines
 So, between them, clocksmiths and millwrights were capable of building complete production systems, integrating power sources, transmission systems and production machinery
 Rather than just the power source or steam engine, contemporaries were amazed at the possibility of constructing entire factories – modern, often small, but perfectly formed – that could operate with the precision of a timepiece
 This was achieved in large part using long-established materials
 For this reason we might describe the early industrial machines as examples of ‘conservative modernity, state-of-the-art new production machines, built using old-established materials and techniques by millwrights and clocksmiths
 The traditional nature of the craft skills employed in devising new production machines did not reduce their imaginative influence over those who saw them
 The mills internal mechanisms suggest the scale and complexity of some cotton manufacturing enterprises
 to the summit of the building 2,500 bushels of malt [about 38 tonnes] a day – and all this while not making ‘the least noise – not more than a clock; you might have heard a pin drop all over the building
 And in Birmingham he saw ‘enormous hammers, wielded by a steam engine >>>>>> crushing in an instant red hot iron bars, converted into thin ribbons
 Elsewhere, engines turned millstones for polishing metal ‘with so great a velocity as to come to pieces by the mere centrifugal force, and copper ‘spread into sheets for sheathing vessels under rollers >>>>>> like paste under the stick of the pastry-cook
 Improved spinning machine by Sir Richard Arkwright, 1775
 Boulton & Watt capitalized on the imaginative attraction of machines by establishing a series of showcase engine installations
 A renowned visitor to the Whitbread engine, in May 1787, was George iii
 To fully secure the companys future prosperity, one last, major matter remained to be resolved
 Watt wrote of their complaints, ‘They say it is inconvenient for the mining interest to be burdened with the payment of engine dues, just as it is inconvenient for the person who wishes to get at my purse that I should keep my breeches-pocket buttoned
 Hornblower held out to the very end: the validity of Watts patent was only finally upheld in 1799, upon which he and Boulton immediately sued for payment from all the engineers copying their separate condenser, and Cornish miners who had withheld payment for using the engine pending a legal decision
 Thus was passed a major milestone in handing over to the company to Boulton & Watts successors – their sons
 The legacy of Boulton & Watt as their partnership ended in 1800 has proved controversial
 biggest competitor
 However, up to 1800 and even beyond, the small scale of industrial enterprise, even in textiles, where powered machines ‘achieved their most famous triumphs, limited the demand for radical transformation in engineering technique
 What was needed, as this chapter has explored, could be met by adapt - ing and scaling up existing, long-established craft skills
 So a range of new oppor- tunities, including innovation in machine tools, remained open for machine making men to explore in the nineteenth century
 The road from the centre of Birmingham to Handsworth, on the citys outskirts, was pleasant and much frequented by James Watt, his family and their visitors
 And as travellers approached Boulton and Watts Soho Manufactory, Yates also noted how they passed ‘gardens, groves, and pleasure grounds that rendered Soho ‘a much-admired scene of picturesque beauty, where the sweets of solitude and retirement are to be enjoyed, as if far distant from the busy hum of men
 Fischers first port of call was the engine yard at the Soho Manufactory, and he was ‘dumbfounded at what he saw: ‘No descrip- tion could do justice to the building in which these works are housed
 He wrote that six Inventive, Creative Genius, 1795–
 In all these buildings steam engines were at work, performing their tasks ‘quietly, regularly and efficiently – a tribute to all that human ingenuity has contributed to their construction
 What is most notable about Fischers account is who was responsible for what he saw in the works
 We have also recounted briefly the legal measures taken to secure Watts patent of 1769 and underpin the prosperity of the company before 1800
 Two major technical issues affected the firm in the late 1790s
 The ironmaster John Wilkinson had made the majority of Boulton & Watts engine cylinders, but a bitter feud with his brother, and the revelation of his piracy of Boulton & Watts engine designs, brought the association to a close
 The Soho Foundry was designed from the start along rational, pre-planned lines
 As one account has styled them, the senior Boulton and Watt were builders, but their sons were organizers
 The Foundry was built around nine workshops, each dedicated to a particular process: for example, cylinder boring, turning, fitting, smithing and pattern making
 Not for nothing did Eric Roll, whose researches unearthed the details of production at Soho outlined here, claim that ‘neither [Frederick] Taylor, [Henry] Ford, nor other experts devise anything >>>>>> that cannot be discovered at Soho before 1805
 The Soho Foundry was vital to the continued success of Boulton & Watt, and it came alongside a business strategy that was markedly different from that previously adopted, and which contributed to the companys success into the nineteenth century
 As well as building beam engines, the company recognized the increasing demand for smaller, more compact and self-contained engine designs
 Equally impor- tant were marine engines to power ships at sea, and in this respect Boulton, Watt & (1)(2) worked on a number of landmark projects: the engine used by the American engineer Robert Fulton in his ship the Clermont, which heralded the opening up of North Americas great rivers by steam; the first steamship used by the Royal Navy, hms Comet; and finally the screw propeller engines for Isambard Kingdom Brunels mighty Great Eastern in 1854
 As well as new products the company also more actively sought new markets
 However, between 1795 and 1825, they built 102 – the majority after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 – and they proved to be highly profitable
 The Soho Foundry was a major landmark in the history of machine making: it was the first purpose-built factory dedicated to constructing machines
 Consequently, the Foundry received a series of extensions to provide additional workshop space in the first eight years of its existence
 By 1804 the total construction cost amounted to more than £27,000, over £850,000 at todays prices, but the whole debt had been repaid out of profits by 1812
 The young James had been intended to have a similar grounding to his father: conventional training in carpentry along with book- keeping, mathematics and the rudiments of running a business, with a view to becoming an engineer or a manufacturer
 But then, just four months into his placement, he was uprooted again to be educated in Geneva in natural philosophy, mathematics and drawing
 improvement in relations – in fact they deteriorated, and he finally quit his home, having discovered that his father did not consider him up to the job of running the engine business
 In 1791 he relocated to Manchester as apprentice with Taylor & Maxwell, a company of cotton dyers and printers, and came under the influence of Thomas Walker, an ardent republican whose views must have appealed to his latent sense of rebellion, and Watt James Watt Junior portrayed by an unknown artist, c(1)
 Junior found himself taking a leading role in the citys Literary and Philosophical Society celebrating the Revolution in (1)(2)18 By the spring of 1792 he was travelling to France, even addressing the Jacobin Club of Paris – and his activities were soon denounced in the House of Commons in (1)(2) Yet even as the younger and elder Watt traded letters arguing furiously the case for and against the French revolutionary cause, Watt Junior realized that he was in a dangerous predicament
 In England the reactionary government was sup- pressing dissent, and young Watt potentially faced charges of sedition
 If James Watt Juniors revolutionary education came to a prema - ture end, he still benefited from a further education of an affective nature
 This, it is argued, amounted to an ‘affective revolution in which people for the first time expected their emotions to have some kind of tangible expression
 Ideas were more vivid & associated together much more rapidly & so associated with words as to produce, perceptions perfectly novel
 This wasnt just a one-man project: Watt Senior designed and built the gas-making apparatus
 This is not to suggest that early engineers and machine makers were all nitrous oxide fiends and libertines, although Joshua Field recalled the 1820s ironmaster John Tickle as ‘an extraordinary character – a kind of excentric genious a Chymist & a Poet, which sounds close
 Classical influences pervaded the education that a young man like Watt Junior might receive in the late eighteenth century
 A student at Eton, for example, would attend 27 hours of teaching every week
 The influence of the antique is suggested by the schoolbooks, notebooks and reading undertaken by James Juniors half-brother, Gregory, totalling approximately 120 items, which are contained in a hair chest stored inside Watts workshop
 Among the chests contents are a Compendious Treatise of Astronomy from 1762, chemistry notebooks, lists of books and tracts to be bound, notebooks and textbooks on maths, geography, navigation, astronomy and algebra
 So, in advance of the emergence of a formal curriculum for training young engineers, their education might be both wide- ranging and disparate
 He was conscious not just of the technicalities of realizing new mechan - ical ideas, but of having to sell a product, a thing not just efficient and mechanically effective but packaged and marketed
 Boulton & Watts work on the engine happened in parallel with tremendous popular appetite for the antique – the culture, archi - tec ture and artefacts of ancient Greece and (1)(2)25 Discoveries made during archaeological excavations at Herculaneum in 1738, Pompeii in 1748 and at Paestum in Southern Italy were widely broadcast in a series of books
 Gregory Watts trunk, inside James Watts workshop
 and 1778 Giovanni Piranesi produced over 100 large, immaculately detailed and popular views of (1)(2) Rather than appealing just to scholars and antiquaries, these books descriptions and illustra- tions also became widely used source material for architects and designers, too
 They also got into the hands of Watts associates
 He also designed Boulton & Watts huge Albion Mill in London and refashioned Matthew Boultons Soho House in the Palladian style
 There is a question over how far into the ranks of Britains machine makers antique influences pervaded
 And even without a formal introduction to the classical world, the workmen in a town like Birmingham would have had an eye for what looked right
 With particular reference to those making machines, there survives a sketchbook that belonged to William Creighton, who rose from erecting engines for Boulton & Watt to become head of their drawing office in 1815, and was a highly active contributor to James Watt Juniors affective education
 Creighton noted the source that inspired each drawing, and from this information we can see that he used Wares Complete Body of Architecture, the Antiquities of Athens and Chambers Treatise on the Decorative part of Civil Architecture (first published in 1759), as well as referring to (1)(2) These, then, suggest that others beyond Boulton & Watt took inspiration from the antique
 It may be that producing work inspired by antiquity was a more accessible occupation than it might initially appear
 Rather than rigidly copying antique forms, with all the study and scholarship of the literature that would entail, Piranesi suggests progressing beyond those forms, using them as a platform for exploration and invention
 Antiquity inspired much of the output of Matthew Boultons Soho (1)(2) In 1767 the Duke of Cumberland commissioned Boulton & Fothergill to make ‘three Great Solomonean Candlesticks, each almost a metre tall, comprising fluted Corinthian columns on decorative plinths surmounted by the candleholders, themselves formed of decorative tripods
 Boulton pushed his workmen to the limit when producing such items: Josiah Wedgwood wrote that Mr Boulton was making an immense large Tripod >>>>>> to finish the top of Demosthenes Lanthorn building >>>>>> from Mr Stew- arts design
 Wedgwood obtained the work for himself by cunningly suggesting they should ‘call in some able Potter to their assistance >>>>>> Would you think it
 Although the most attention was devoted to these very expen- sive objects, made in relatively small quantities, antiquity also found its way into the output of Boultons toymakers
 Boulton employed at Soho one (1) (1) Wendler, who wrote from Naples that he had obtained a copy of Hamiltons Antiquities, comprising ‘about 456 prints in folio divided into 4 volumes [comprising] handsome Designs & patterns for the Birmingham Manu fac torys >>>>>> I am certain, that >>>>>> all our chief manufacturers >>>>>> would be very glad to have those Prints, for they may be very usefull for (1)(2)42 This would suggest a wider utility for such source material beyond Boultons works
 So, antiquity pervaded the environment in which machine- makers and manufacturers like Boulton & Watt operated
 Boulton and Watt were too old for this new fashion but their sons were not
 William Chamberss Treatise on the Decorative Part of Civil Architecture provides a springboard for exploring how they did so
 The unearthing of the temple is suggestive of engineers mining of antiquity for inspiration
 that artists should ‘study the effects that flow from those works of art ‘which by the common consent of ages are esteemed beautiful
 Gwilt believed that we construct meaning about a piece of architecture by looking at it, by striving to understand it and by devising an emotional response to it, and we can frame an analysis of machine making and engine making in these terms
 Regarding how the engine worked, Boulton & Watt had taken great care with their standardized range of machines to define the physical characteristics of each – so much so that John Farey devoted an entire chapter of his magisterial Treatise on the Steam Engine (1827) to discussing them
 For each size, the diameter of the steam cylinder, the length of stroke and number of strokes per minute of the piston, even the volume of steam expected to be consumed per minute, were all carefully defined
 The same year that Fareys book was published, Thomas Tredgold produced his own book, The Steam (1)(2) Reading both tomes together, Tredgolds is much more theoretical – as Tredgold described it himself, it is about ‘the application of science to art, and descriptions, drawings and rules of thumb are matched by complex equations and algebra
 But together, the books represent an immense quantity of knowledge about steam, codified and made available to readers
 However, the sudden expansion of publishing about steam raises an important question: Boulton & Watts partnership had ended in 1800 and since then, two decades had elapsed with no clearly formulated guides on how to make those engines beyond those materials already written by the firm of Boulton & (1)(2) Tredgold claimed in 1827 that ‘the effects that may be obtained by engines of different species, have now been reduced for the first time, to definite measures, and their proportions referred to scientific principles
 So the question is: what was the received wisdom underpinning engine building in the critical two decades after 1800
 As a first step, we return to the influence of antiquity
 Each of these components in turn resolved into tiny details: ovolos, astragals, fillets, larmiers, ogees, reglets and annulets, each contributing its mite to the appearance of the whole
 It is tempting to suggest that here was a system ready-made to be appropriated when designing engines
 Tellingly the pair were in exactly the proportions required by the Tuscan order
 However, these are just two examples out of hundreds where there was no precise association with the classical orders
 We must not forget that as understanding of its internal work- ings grew, the engine was increasingly perceived not as a static structure, but as one subject to dynamic stresses and strains, which would change continuously as it worked
 The former, necessary to safely and economically ease the flow of steam around the engine, was not an issue that Boulton & Watts forebears in antiquity had to consider, but it played a decisive role in engine design alongside the latter
 This is not to entirely discount the influence of antiquity on engineering design
 The maker of this small beam engine, c(1), is unknown, but its excellent design includes many classical design motifs, including finely detailed columns
 Later James Nasmyth wrote that ‘viewing abstractedly the forms of the various details of which every machine is composed, we shall find that they consist of certain combinations of six geometrical figures, namely, the line, the plane, the circle, the cylinder, the cone, and the sphere
 But if the precise nature of antiquitys influence is hard to quantify, what other factors influenced engineerings evolution after 1800
 First and foremost, Boulton and Watt continued to wield consid er  able moral influence, even though they were personally no longer involved in building engines
 Even Thomas Tredgold, one of Watts critics, wrote: An almost innumerable quantity of schemes for improvements on the steam engine have been crowded on the public eye within the last ten years, but except a few for improvements in construction, of small importance, there has been nothing done that is worthy of detaining the reader to notice
 As late as 1868, John Bourne was still publishing Watts rules of thumb for engine making – for determining the thickness of the connecting rod, the diameters of shafts and the size of beams, for instance – alongside more recent theories
 How far engineers actually stuck to Boulton and Watts plans is questionable
 to one, the changes having no regularity >>>>>> Equally irregular are Maudslays proportions but approaching to 2 to 1; Fenton, Murray, and Woods about as 2 1/2 is to 1
 The occasional effects of these disparate approaches were seen by William Creighton in Glasgow, where he wrote in April 1803 of having ‘visited several of the engines here >>>>>> they are as usual dirty and from the insufficiency of thin framing & construction of the frames are all distorted
 This last quote gives us a way out of this impasse: Boulton & Watt set the benchmark for how the engine performed
 Not all engineers were single-minded, deadly rational beings like (1)(2) As may be surmised from the preceding debate, there was a tremendous range of opinion on the nature of engine making
 For the first time, after all, they were as much concerned with the outward appearance of the engine as with its internal workings
 As we left the engine, being built on a new standardized scheme at the Soho Foundry, it was very much a functional machine, accu- rately built but with little conscious thought given to its outward appearance
 Engines built by Henry Harvey at Hayle, for example, were ‘more like orna- ments for a show-room than machines for draining a mine
 Rather than the traditional division between process and product, what we have here is the process as product
 From the 1790s cast iron was being employed in greater quan- tities, and the means of shaping it offered new aesthetic possibilities
 This was a defining moment in the engines transformation, giving it ‘a grace of motion not hitherto perceived
 All this work depended on improved pattern making and foundry work
 The foundryman had to avoid air bubbles in castings and sought to ensure toughness by carefully cooling the finished product over a long period(1) This degree of care and precision beyond what had been done before made possible Samuel Cleggs contention that with cast-iron construction, ‘It does not cost one farthing more to construct an elegant figure, than it does to create a deformity
 The potential of cast iron for multiplying decorative details in machinery was not lost on contemporary engineers, who wrestled Boulton & Watts ‘Lap beam engine, 1788
 with the question of what an aesthetic reflecting the steam engines importance, status and power should consist of
 Simi - larly Julie Wosk believed that ‘after 1830 >>>>>> designers confronted the need to create engine frames that embodied the centurys pride in technology
 First among these was the application of antiquity
 As beam engines evolved into self-contained structures from being built into a masonry engine house, columns proliferated, often fluted, with plain Doric and more ornate Ionic and Corinthian cap- itals, and supporting entablatures that included delicate moulded detail
 The aesthetic transformation of the engine was noted by contem - poraries
 What was once a confused pile of piping and cylinders has become an elegant iron building of Doric and Corinthian pillars
 This quotation leads us beyond the purely antique forms towards other influences that came to bear for relatively short but intense periods
: the Henry Ford Museum has an outstanding engine by New Yorks Novelty Ironworks dated from 1855, which would not look out of place working in a cathedral
 Gothic forms were supplemented by an Egyptian revival in mechanical form
 Inside Benjamin Hick of Bolton constructed a powerful twin beam engine which repeated many of the Egyptian details from outside, down to the ‘chronometric governor, a name evoking the capabilities of its builders, in the form of a winged scarab beetle
 If these startling reinventions of long-established designs suggest discontinuity, they are balanced by strong elements of stabi - lity and continuum
 of their prior knowledge, which was as much cultural as technical
 This approach is best conveyed, not by Boulton & Watt in Birmingham, or even Murray in Leeds, but by the engineers of London and, particularly, Henry (1)(2) Maudslays works, just off Westminster Bridge Road and across the river from Whitehall, have been alluded to already: they were founded in 1798 and became a hothouse for engineering talent
 Nasmyth recalled Maudslays maxims for machine design: ‘First, get a clear notion of what you desire to accomplish, ‘keep a sharp lookout upon your materials; get rid of every pound Model Hick double beam engine in the Egyptian style, 1840, and displayed at the Great Exhibition of 1851
 of material you can do without, ‘avoid complexities, and make every- thing as simple as possible – or, as the historian James Hamilton has put it, understanding, economy, simplicity
 The machines paid ‘the most scrupulous attention to accuracy and durability >>>>>> presenting an elegant pro- portion in their form, which is very agreeable to the eye, and set new standards in metal construction: economy in the use of metal, the replacement of solid forms with carefully formed bracing and restrained use of decorative details like plain columns and finials
 This approach was carried through to the machine tools Maudslay built for his London works, and in turn influenced those who trained there
 Here, then, was the start of a new machine aesthetic which had its own character
 With ‘strength in the proper place, stability without unnec - essary weight, and simplicity of form without meanness, further ornament was unnecessary, ‘because their own proportions [would] constitute their greatest
 After 1800, two competing pressures shaped how this new approach evolved
 As they did so, these engineers were ‘exhilarated and enthused about the beauty of their own creations, about whose formal qualities and the newness of these qualities they were quite clear in their minds
 Remnants of old forms began to disappear, and the new approach, ‘equally remarkable for elegance of appearance and compactness of arrangement, gained ground
 This is not to characterize the new way of designing machines as a complete break with the past: in its details, it was not
 In fact, Maudslays ‘table steam engine, a compact machine patented in 1807, was criticized as being ‘a little too complex >>>>>> its frame reminds one of an antiquated style of cabinet work
 and decoration tipped firmly to the latter: decorative ‘bun feet, spiral knurled columns, condenser cisterns or boiler casings sur- rounded by brass sheet decorated with patterns, flowers or leaves, even construction in silver
 This vernacular style emphasized engineers personal motivations and interests, not formal design protocols
 Some nineteenth-century commentators would take a dim view of this approach
 But Clegg in his turn had critics: some of his examples of tasteful engineering design were dismissed by the editor of the Civil Engineer and Architects Journal as ‘architectural monstrosities that were ‘vapid and quakerlike
 In treating the output of the early nineteenth-century engineers as art, then, we can see that its substance, and its virtues or defects, were both varied and contested
 The antique continued to hold sway into the 1840s but, in the United Kingdom at least, it was increasingly surpassed by the new functional approach
 Regardless of how it was attained, however, the period until the 1840s was unrivalled in its pursuit of beauty in engineering
 Maudslays epitaph, fittingly cast into an iron tombstone, remarked on his com- bination of ‘mathematical accuracy and beauty of construction (my emphasis)
 When Hans Casper Escher visited Manchester in 1814, he wrote that ‘One must admire the steam engines here
 Sir George Head wrote of the engine supplying air blast to iron furnaces at the Low Moor Iron Works, ‘I have listened to a storm on the Atlantic, I have stood on the Table Rock at Niagara, yet never did I hear a sound in nature equal to this – so terrific, or of so stunning a din
 The emergence of the engine as a carefully styled object reflects its role as symbol of the new industrial age, signalling dignity, pros- perity and status as much as technical mastery
 This approach was entirely congruent with how the antique was appropriated and imitated in other industries, comprising ‘an evocation of objects in other forms, and indeed the new form might well surpass the original in inventiveness
 With the future of the engine-building company in safe hands, his father was about to embark on one last, big project: sculpture copying
 The staircase up to the second floor of James Watts house, Heathfield, was steep and dark
 This was James Watts workshop
 The workshop was in the attic of Heathfield, commissioned by Watt from the architect James Wyatt in 1789 for a site on Handsworth Heath, a mile and a half northwest from the centre of (1)(2) Watt and his family moved in during September 1790
 Heathfield would be Watts home as he withdrew from the steam-engine business, and for the seven Life after Death, 1800–
 The room that Watt chose to be his workshop was at first simply a place to stow away belongings; in 1801 he sent for a quantity of possessions from Glasgow, and these duly arrived
 But the Watts workshop, as illustrated in Samuel Smiless Lives of the Engineers Boulton and Watt (1865)
 rooms solitariness was an advantage for Watts purposes: here he could pursue projects and experiments undisturbed
 The garret workshop had a dual purpose
 What the workshop was, and what it stood for, together ensured that Watt remained a commanding presence long after his death
 Watts sculpture project was not confined to his workshop but sprawled over several different parts of (1)(2) His will records that he had things stored in his study and ‘the two rooms in the South East corner of my house and >>>>>> my laboratory or elsewhere
 The children of the Pemberton family, tenants living at Heathfield in the 1860s, recalled ‘wonderful discoveries of out-of-the-way things >>>>>> discarded clay crucibles of all sorts and sizes; worn-out and queerly-shaped earthenware retorts; empty phials of all shapes and dimensions, with strange inscriptions on their labels >>>>>> in an out- building we came across two huge blocks of roughly-hewn white marble
 The two sculpture-copying machines embody Watts continuing fascination with precision manufacture
 A portfolio in the workshop contains drawings of the reducing machine in an early form, dated 1804
 Development of the machines presented Watt with several challenges
 Conversely winter also limited the progress achieved, with Watt complaining of ‘the place having been too cold for me
 The machines built on a broader interest in sculpture, and con- nections to the sculpture trade, that reached back into the 1790s
 Pierotti came from Lucca in northwest Italy and had arrived in England at Dover in 1770 before living in Birmingham and then Edinburgh, where he was entered on the Register of Aliens on 2 December 1803
 Nothing is known about him beyond this, but we do know that con- siderable numbers of mould makers or formatori came from Lucca, itinerant makers and vendors of plaster casts
 each
 Watt evidently purchased some items from Pierotti while the latter was based in Birmingham because, alongside his catalogue, there survives in Watts workshop a bill ‘for making moulds of Plaster of Paris, marked ‘Birmingham October the 8th 1792
 And among the items in Pierottis catalogue is an entry for ‘Small heads – Proserpina
 As well as finished casts, Watt was also an avid collector of moulds for antique figures
 a figure of Atlas, complete with a globe to rest on his shoulders, which I suggest is a match for the figure of ‘Atals ordered from John Pierotti in October 1792
 Watts copying machines were, then, the culmination of a sus- tained interest in the world of sculpture that extended to purchasing moulds and taking his own copies from them
 Thomas Howard attempted to ‘transplant A three-part plaster mould of an arm from Watts collection inside his workshop
 old Greece into England through his extended pursuit of statuary
 There emerged in the eighteenth century a trade in marble copies of originals in Rome, for example, which were hugely costly on account of the time they took to make: one Italian maker had spent fourteen months on a copy, with another five months expected to finish it off
 Further demand for sculpture was driven by the Grand Tour, as the well-to-do and classically educated set out from Britain to see the antique sights of Italy, visiting Rome, Pompeii, Herculaneum and Venice, among other places
 Returning from that experience, they sought small, portable pieces of sculpture that could be displayed in their homes as symbols of wealth, knowledge and connoisseurship
 Gilbert White took this one step further at his house in Selborne, (1)(2) Unable to afford a statue for his grounds, he mounted a carefully painted wooden outline of a sculptural figure on an appropriate plinth; from a distance it could not be distinguished from a three-dimensional statue
 By the mid-eighteenth century, then, a professional trade had emerged in England, to satisfy the demand for sculpture
 But another, unique trade in cheaper statuary and statuettes, most often made in plaster, evolved in early nineteenth-century (1)(2) Rather than pieces of ‘art, the output of this trade was regarded as a commodity to be bought and sold
 How the plaster copy trade generated reproductions was a tortuous process
 The precision obtained, then, was highly variable
 This background helps contextualize Watts copying machines: he had an interest in sculpture of some long standing, there was a widely held appetite for sculpture in materials ranging from marble to plaster, and low-quality copies offered the potential for improve- ment
 The technical challenge and financial rewards of making high-quality copies of sculpture was one that Watt, and others like him, could not resist
 What is notable about all these machines is the length of time after Watts that they were made
 The mechanism was driven by an ingenious flexible drive and could pivot around a ball joint, creating a larger range of movement compared to Watts machines
 composer, poet, preacher and phrenologist whose father had been a clockmaker
 Thomas Jefferson purchased two to keep up his voluminous correspondence and declared it ‘one of the greatest inventions of this age
 With his experience of turning either a three-dimensional shape or a two-dimensional letter into a two-dimensional image (as with his physiognotrace and polygraph respectively), it was a logical next step for Hawkins to experiment with turning a three-dimensional original into a three-dimensional copy – as in sculpture copying – and that is exactly what he did
 This gentleman offered to take out a joint patent with Mr Watt; but he had suffered so much from former patents, that he was unwilling to embark in any new concern
 That neighbour was (1)(2) There are no letters between Hawkins and Watt in the latters correspondence, and the details of any meeting are lost
 Watt, getting old, and confronted by the young, energetic Hawkins, may have felt discouraged
 Whatever happened, Watts sculpture-copying machines were the first of a new generation of machines constructed to the same end
 A prime demonstration of this is provided by Watt, who conscientiously noted the time taken for each of the processes needed to make a single bust of Sappho in January 1811: a total of 39 hours
 Assuming a mechanical carver could produce two busts in a long, 80-hour week, perhaps three with practice, this was still far behind the output for producing plaster casts
 And Achille Collas, manufacturing sculpture by machine in France, found that pirates immediately cast copies of his copies and sold them much cheaper than he could
 Watts sculpture-copying machines are enigmatic, then
 Watt even obtained a death mask of Matthew Boulton following his death in 1809, and this was copied six times in reduced form
 What became more significant than the commercial aspects of sculpture for Watt were the practicalities of multiplying his own image
 Other versions were placed in London, Glasgow and (1)(2) It was acclaimed as the finest resemblance of a man eulogized on his monument in Westminster Abbey as one of ‘the real Benefactors of the World
 As well as the Chantrey and Turnerelli busts, Watts workshop contains a mystery object that has only recently been identified
 The parts were scanned with a laser to produce a digital image, and these were then combined electronically to reveal a previously A reduced-size plaster mould and cast from the death mask of Matthew Boulton, James Watts business partner and friend, made 1809–19
 unknown bust of Watt, which was rendered into a physical artefact using a three-dimensional printer that built up layers of nylon fused together by heat
 The small copy was signed on the back, in Watts hand, ‘Reduced from Gahagans bust by scraping 1807 – giving a date for the original and a pointer to one of the Gahagan family of sculptors, although which of them remains unclear, being the artist commissioned to make the original
 Watt was, then, generating images of himself in considerable quantities
 His bust proved highly charismatic: when Edgeworth saw it she was struck ‘almost breathless, and in 1841 a writer was inspired by it to write that ‘As I came home, the booming rattle of the train seemed like the spirit of Watt still ani- mating inert matter
 more widely after his death
 Their nearest indus- trial counterparts were the machines used by the Bank of England to make the dies for minting coins, which used a similar stylus and cutting tool arrangement to engrave the detail of an original produced by an artist onto a steel copy
 Boultons minting machines are suggestive of a broader trend towards mechanization; in cotton factories, an automatic spinning machine of 1825 could process 100 lb of cotton sixteen times faster than the equivalent machine in 1780, in only 125 hours as opposed to 2,000
 Faced with these new capabilities, Thomas Carlyle, in his essay ‘Signs of the Times of 1829, characterized the period as ‘not an Heroical, Devotional, Philosophical, or Moral Age, but, above all others, the Mechanical (1)(2) It is the Age of Machinery, in every outward and inward sense of that word
 Watts steam engine was the icon of Carlyles age of machinery, instrumental in ‘effecting the most remarkable revolution in all departments of industry that the world has ever seen
 Although historians have realized since that the expectations of steam, and its status as a symbol of progress, ran somewhat in advance of its actual employment, and waterwheels actually provided more power generation than engines until the mid-nineteenth century, this did not reflect at that time on Watt himself
 The Romantic poet William Wordsworth believed Watt was, ‘considering both the magnitude and the universality of his genius >>>>>> perhaps the most extraordinary man that this country ever pro- duced
 He was elevated into the traditional national pantheon of aristocrats and monarchs, military men and statesmen
 The generation of so much iconography around Watt fed debates about the nature of his achievements throughout the nineteenth century
 The earliest articles that surveyed the engines development, in the Encyclopaedia Britannica of 1797, were written by Watts friend John Robison with input from (1)(2)63 An article in Olinthus Gregorys Treatise on Mechanics of 1807, accusing Watt of seeking to ‘repress the energies of his contemporaries and monopolize engine construction, was suppressed after pressure from (1)(2)64 After Watts death in 1819 his son remained avidly protective of his fathers reputation; François Arago, who wrote the first biography of James Senior, wrote of ‘the religious respect with which my friend the present Mr James Watt regards all that recalls the remembrance of his father
 This careful shaping of Watts legacy reflects a second aspect of the debate about him: whether he was a philosopher or a craftsman
 This was particularly manifested in manipulation of the story that, as a child, he was enthralled by the steam issuing from a kettle
 as subsequently told concerned the potential industrial power of the steam, Watt and his son instead emphasized that it was about the steams philosophical properties – in fact, Watt Junior himself modi - fied the original account
 By comparison, subsequent biographers, most notably Samuel Smiles, gave Watts workshop prominence in their accounts, identifying it as a place of handicraft rather than philosophy
 The controversy over Watts legacy, and what he stood for, has raged up to the present day as engineering and science have been afforded differing degrees of priority
 By the centenary of Watts death in 1919, however, he had been firmly reappropriated as a craftsman and engineer: it is telling that one of the largest groups of contributors to the commemorative appeal launched in 1919 ‘comprised workers in engineering and metal- working firms throughout the Birmingham region
 However, amid the books and two-dimensional material, the busts and other sculptural representations of Watt, his workshop itself has sometimes been mentioned but rarely considered in detail
 As Watt was continuously reappraised and reappropriated by different groups, his workshop always remained as a presence in the background
 Watt Junior kept the workshop door firmly locked and the room remained entirely untouched until his own death in 1848
 Muirheads description of the workshop indicates its tremendous imaginative power, for he wrote that The classical ‘garret and all its mysterious contents >>>>>> have ever since been carefully preserved in the same order as when the hand and ‘eye of the master were last withdrawn from them >>>>>> all things there seemed still to breathe of the spirit that once gave them life and energy; and only the presence of some reverend dust silently announced, that no profane hand, forgetful of the ‘religio loci [place of sanctity], had been permitted to violate the sanctities of that magical retreat
 For Muirhead the workshop was a place of religious significance, as it was for the biographer Samuel Smiles, who finished a detailed account of its contents by stating that in it the ‘spirit of Watts work survived, as if embodied in the artefacts ‘fast crumbling to decay
 Even if it had remained untouched for so long, the mere fact of its existence cast a spell over those concerned with Watt and how he was presented
 Alongside these items, however, Watts workshop remained the ultimate prize
 That came to nothing, but four months later, Francis Pettit Smith wrote rather unsubtly to James Gibson Watt, ‘How often I have longed to take a peep into Heathfield >>>>>> where I am informed a host of invaluable relics do still exist – which in honour to the illustrious man should once more see the daylight – and be preserved to the end of time in some public institute like this
 By January 1864 no progress had been made, and Woodcroft, exas- perated, wrote to Pettit Smith, ‘I am ready to go with you any day to Birmingham whether Mr Gibson Watt gives his permission or not
 Mechanical drawings, chemicals, optical instru- ments and almost every imaginable thing that room contains
 The visitors were so engrossed in what they saw that they spent seven hours exploring, and Woodcroft left his glasses behind; they Watts alleged ‘experimentalising steam kettle, forming part of a self-contained ‘bachelors stove with grate and cooking pan, c(1)
 were later returned to him by Mary Pemberton, daughter of the tenant, accompanied by a ‘kindly expressed note
 Woodcrofts fascination with the workshop reflected a very particular, mechanical view of the world and of (1)(2) This view was based on a realization that many of the industrial sites and machines of Britains Industrial Revolution were, even in the 1860s, at risk of destruction
 In Birmingham the Soho establishments associated with Boulton and Watt were dis - appearing, too
 A short distance away, the Soho Manufactory was either empty or being sublet, and was demolished in early 1863
 Individual machines also faced an uncertain future
 Unsurprisingly the engine was described as being ‘in a very rusty dilapidated condition by 1862
 Even if an artefact did perchance find its way to a museum, its survival was still not guaranteed, because popular fascination with historic machines was manifested in a very tactile, hands-on way
 Just as inventors achieved heroic status after 1850, so did the objects they built
 As with so many other artefacts, the future of Watts workshop was never entirely certain
 The heroic objects pictured include Richard Arkwrights spinning machine at bottom left, the locomotive Rocket alongside it, and the ‘Comet marine engine at top right
 facsimile of a small engine that had belonged to his illustrious predecessor, which was almost certainly intended as a gift to smooth the path of negotiation towards acquiring the workshop
 A com- peting group, the Birmingham-based Committee of the James Watt Memorial, was also attempting to preserve the workshop in April 1865
 The workshop remained at Heathfield for the rest of the nine- teenth century
 That is not generally known, & I have not mentioned it to anyone before
 Far from being undisturbed, the workshop contents were subject to some considerable disruption
 Aside from unexpected removals, the workshop contents were in a parlous physical condition by the 1880s
 What is clear from the inventory is the sheer diversity of the workshops contents: although Bennet Woodcroft sought to acquire the workshop as a shrine to Watt the steam engineer, he was inadvertently preserving evidence of a very different Watt who worked on a wide range of other projects
 The multifaceted nature of the workshop had already been noted by Samuel Smiles when he visited it in 1864 or 1865, and his evo- cation of what he saw is valuable enough to be quoted in detail: Many objects lay about or in the drawers >>>>>> busts, medallions, and figures, waiting to be copied by the sculpture machine, many medallion moulds, a store of plaster of Paris, and a box of plaster casts from (1)(2) Here are Watts ladles for melting lead, his foot-rule, his glue-pot, his hammer
 There are quadrant glasses, compasses, scales, weights, and sundry boxes of mathematical instruments >>>>>> on the shelves are minerals and chemicals in pots and jars, on which the dust of nearly half a century has settled
 Smiles wrongly identified a number of items in the workshop while describing them, including a model of the governor used by Watt to regulate the speed of the steam engine
 What in fact characterizes the workshop most of all is the close proximity of objects of ‘craft and ‘philosophy: ther m  o meters lie in drawers alongside tools for engraving scales, and sets of stamps for forming letters in metal
 Only in 1924 did a plan for preserving this diverse range of items finally coalesce
 In April 1924 Henry Lyons, director of the Science Museum in London, was in contact with Major Gibson Watt, and by November 1924 it was clear that the house would not be saved
 Watt would most likely be embarrassed at the amount of attention the workshop receives
 To conclude, then, we return to the question of whether Watt was a philosopher or a craftsman
 All of them belonged to one man, and the sheer quantity of material, crossing the boundaries between philosophy and craft, makes it hard to categorize the contents against any one of the labels that have been applied to Watt over time: philosopher or craftsman primarily, but engineer and chemist, as well
 In the fields of science and technology conceptions of ‘craft were for a long time particularly mechanical in their outlook
 In a world where not only science and technology but art and consumption besides came hand in hand, a young workman in his apron might equally have been a chemist avoiding splashes of acid or watching the thermometers during a heat experiment, a sculptor pouring wet plaster into moulds, an instrument maker engraving the scale on a quadrant, or a foundry- man fettling a cast Doric column-head for the framing of a beam engine
