 Gladstone's “anxiety” marked the culmination of a decades-long movement that represented the Armenian cause as an imperial duty realized through British diplomacy. The vision found strongest expression in the person of Gladstone himself, described by one contemporary as a “humane man” with a “keen sense of the religious bearing of political questions.”11 Born in Liverpool in 1809 to a relatively prosperous, evangelical merchant family, his life and career spanned the nineteenth century. His father was a self-made man and sent the young Gladstone to Eton in 1821 and later to Christ Church at the University of Oxford. His education taught him self-reliance and helped him to forge important relationships with notable political and religious figures of the time. These experiences, according to his biographer, Colin Matthew, led to Gladstone's belief that the purpose of liberal education was to reinforce orthodox Anglican Christianity.12 His interest in orthodox religion during a period when Anglicanism was undergoing intense scrutiny from within led to a lifelong respect of the Eastern Orthodox Church as a unifying national and religious institution for Near Eastern peoples and would deeply influence his personal and political life.
 Religious, secular, and political advocacy organizations came to share this vision. They found inspiration in Gladstone's advocacy on behalf of Ottoman Christian minorities who belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Church which he had embraced in his early years. Eastern orthodoxy, many believed, belonged to a religion sharing a common origin with Anglicanism.22 Anglicans and Nonconformists alike embraced the cause, raising money and performing relief work in the Ottoman Empire.23 Such activism cast humanitarian intervention as a simultaneously moral, religious and imperial duty that Gladstone, shown as a Christian crusader in Figure 1.1, maintained would “serve civilization” (Figure 1.1). In 1876, advocates founded the Eastern Question Association as an umbrella organization to advocate for Ottoman minorities that included Bulgarian, Armenian, Assyrian, and Greek Orthodox Christians.24
 Links with the Ottoman Empire in general, and Armenia in particular, were further strengthened by understandings of the region as the cradle of civilization and the birthplace of Christianity. Critics maintained that the end of the Crimean War offered a new opportunity for the West to reconnect with its ancient past in the East. “Since the 17th century there has been but little direct intercourse between the Orthodox East and the Protestant West,” observed one journalist, “but the great events of the last few years, which have opened for England such a career in the East, cannot fail to bring the subject very prominently before every one.” Anglicanism symbolically rejoined Eastern Orthodox Christianity in its birthplace in the Holy Land with the building of a memorial church at Constantinople to commemorate the war and unite Britain “with the members of the ancient churches of the East.” The British built this Anglican Church as a war memorial. It was “assigned a conspicuous site upon the hills which crown the Bosporus” and represented “a trophy of our heroism and our faith.”35 A monument to Christianity and victory over its Russian rival, the church promised to unite Orthodox peoples with Anglicanism in the Holy Land. The memorial church still exists today.

 Across empires ideals of childhood held out the tantalising promise of tying  together societies composed of ‘settlers’ and ‘expatriates’ proclaiming diverse eth- nic affiliations. Recent histories have begun to revise older views of French and  British ‘communities’ in East and Southeast Asia as mere accomplices of impe- rial expansion, revealing these groupings of settlers, businessmen, officials and  religious workers instead as fractured and fissiparous. Robert Bickers, Christian  Henriot, Eric Jennings, J. P. Daughton and others have revealed that they were  rarely committed to any overarching programme or imperial aim.11 In the face  of such diversity, those determined to assert the nation on the ‘frontier’ rallied  behind more aloof genres of colonialism. As they built claims for racial differ- ence upon evidence of the impossibility of white settlement, childhood became a  key resource through which racial difference could be defined. Consequently, the  question of how to raise children in nonsettlement colonies linked the ‘low prag- matism’ of colonialism, as Bickers and Henriot have termed it, with high politics.12
 Far from being the ‘indirect rule’ with which the British Empire was often as- sociated, governance in the British Crown Colonies of Hong Kong and the Straits  Settlements was intentionally direct. Both formed part of an imperial system  with a constitutional structure that confined merchant power, closed off wider  representation and concentrated power in nonelective executive and legislative councils and a governor (who was monitored by the Colonial Office and parlia- ment).76 This system was intended to avoid the pitfalls of ‘older’ colonialisms, in  particular those of British India where large Anglo-Indian and poor white pop- ulations had come to be condemned as a problem, and centres such as Shanghai,  where municipal government endowed ‘settlers’ with a powerful voice.77
 Following the uprising a British parliamentary select committee reappraised  conditions in India. The committee endorsed a new vision of state-run coloni- alism as more distant and aloof. Authorities perceived entanglement—for which  they held settlers primarily responsible—as blurring the lines of racial identity  and eroding authority. This shift heralded a quite different political vision of the  colonial future and one that clashed with the interests of planters in India, many  of whom had raised children there. It was in the teeth of settler resistance to this  new line that medical authorities in the pay of the state marshalled arguments  based upon evidence of children’s health behind attempts to prove the impossi- bility of white settlement. These medical and administrative interventions had the  effect of producing European children in colonial India as the ultimate symbol of  white racial endangerment and of the degenerative impact of the tropics. Young  people’s vulnerability made them exemplars of national cultures whose exotic  bodies served as a site of ‘essential’ civilisational difference. Children’s presence  came to validate claims for the tropics as endangering whites, but also, by exten- sion, assumptions that geographical dislocation offered proof of a civilisational  superiority that was fixed in the environment.14
 The notional distinction between ‘true’ childhood—voiced by Knollys in Hong  Kong—and that which was not childhood in the true sense of the word emerged  in the wake of liberal reformers’ efforts to advance child protection through state  intervention. In the mid-nineteenth century, metropolitan child labour reformers established the economically worthless, domestic childhood as a middle-class  ideal. This ideal was driven into sharper relief after 1870 as evangelical-inspired  activists and school attendance officers laboured to achieve its extension across  class lines. In Britain, Enlightenment thinking had advanced assumptions of the  supposedly essential malleability of children and their special receptiveness to  environmental influences. Reformers therefore focused not only upon longer- term solutions to address the moral and physical problems of the labouring poor,  such as urban renewal, but also on the retrieval and reform of children from  working-class milieux.
 It did not take long for the impact of this social movement to ripple out to  empire, where the Contagious Diseases Acts had originated. The first was im- plemented in 1857 in Hong Kong, while a second, passed in 1867, had provided  police there with additional powers.16 The success of the metropolitan reformers’  campaign tactics soon led them to extend their critique to the colonies. And as  demands for the repeal of the acts extended to empire, so too did other aspects  of the purity movement. The 1880s emerged as a period of reflection upon sin at  home and abroad. Stead’s Pall Mall Gazette published an article in which ‘Public  Servant’ asked, “Is Empire Consistent with Morality?” (He answered the question  with a resounding “No!”)17 For a growing number of critics the male-dominat- ed society of empire ‘commissioned sin,’ and in light of this elite commentators  argued for imperial reform through the introduction of domestic values, that is,  through the presence of wives, families and children.
 Sir John Pope Hennessy, the reform-minded governor of Hong Kong, was  keenly aware of such criticisms. During his governorship (1877–82) the Crown  Colony had repeatedly come under fire from both metropolitan campaigners and  its own liberal-minded chief justice for its lax moral standards. Hennessy himself initiated an inquiry into aspects of Hong Kong’s Contagious Diseases Ordinance  but failed to convince the Colonial Office to repeal it. Struggling to defend the  colonial record amid condemnation of the acts (which remained on the statute)  and evidence of ‘child slavery’ (discussed in Chapter 8), he turned to census data  to argue, “The tropical Colony where European children flourish cannot be very  unhealthy.”18 Drawing a veil over disastrous sanitary conditions, brothel slavery  and other problems, Hennessy connected ‘progress’ with the proliferating pres- ence of European children ‘Out East.’ The governor was not alone in identifying the presence of the European child  as a barometer of imperial-moral health. As the medical and social costs of male  profligacy to British imperialism came under attack, other residents of Brit- ish-governed territories in Asia joined this chorus. Alicia Little, a travel writer,  anti-footbinding campaigner and sometime resident of Shanghai, attacked the  old bachelor-dominated ‘mess system,’ claiming that “the greatest change of all”  was “the superseding of the old hong life by family life. Shanghai is full, happi- ly, now of ladies and children and they have broken up the junior messes.”19 In  Singapore, Dr. David Galloway, a Scottish medical doctor who had arrived in the  Straits in 1895, celebrated children as corroborating the ideal of the dutiful wife  as mother.20 In Hong Kong the chaplain to the resident British armed forces, the  Reverend E. J. Hardy, explained in a lecture of 1903 how “wife and children are a  kind of discipline” in the tropics. For these commentators, children’s presence in  empire was suggestive of a sexually disciplined colonial masculinity. The family  with children, in their view, might provide a far more authentic foundation for  social order built around the home than could bachelorhood in the messes and  chummeries.21 Trans-colonially, ‘true children’ emerged as a corrective to empire’s  ‘spoilt children.’22
 In this vein, in 1889 James Cantlie, by then one of Hong Kong’s foremost medi- cal doctors, declared before a meeting of the Hong Kong Literary Society, “A home means in its essential sense a place wherein children can be reared.”23 Having  arrived in Hong Kong two years earlier with his wife and baby son, Cantlie was  himself engaged with the challenge of realising the colonial home. Whilst in the  metropole, he had authored Degeneration amongst Londoners (1885) and played a  leading role in ‘Tropicalising’ readings of the labouring poor in London’s slums.24  In Hong Kong, this prominent though controversial supporter of the domestica- tion of metropolitan male working-class culture underlined the essentially degen- erative impact of the tropical environment upon children’s health. Nevertheless  he clung, like Hennessy, to the notion of the child as barometer of the moral health  of a community being redefined in terms of ‘exile.’ The commentaries of Cantlie and others drew their power from metropolitan  notions of mother and child as a powerful moral unit. These had deep historical  roots, being tangled up in Britain with Puritan traditions of the family and mar- riage. From the 1840s, evangelical writers, congregational ministers, temperance  and moral reformers and physicians invoked ideals of the family as an affective  relationship, and the home as a sacred and intimate space, separated from the  outside world of work, competition, the market and politics. Adultery and com- mercial sex embodied in the figure of the prostitute or ‘public woman’ contra- vened the spiritual essence of reproductive sexual union in the home. Through  the close links it developed with the reform of labour practices, philanthropy  and evangelicalism, childhood for some educated observers came to represent an  essentially ethical space, a space of innocence and one ideally to be protected.25  As James Cantlie was at pains to emphasise, in the tropics it was children and not  their mothers who assumed the mantle of supreme referents of the ‘home,’ and  by extension European civilisational superiority.
 Members of the influential and ideologically diverse French colonial lobby  (or Union Coloniale Française) found the prospect of settlement in ‘new France’  tantalising. As Marie-Paule Ha has shown, lobbyists threw their weight behind a  fin de siècle campaign promoting women’s emigration to the colonies, organised  by the Société Française D’Émigration des Femmes.55 While others supported  emigration partly as a solution to fin de siècle problems of depopulation and  a ‘blocked’ metropolitan marriage market, the colonial lobbyist Joseph Chail- ley-Bert identified it as a means of ensuring that the French colonial presence in  Asia would not only persist but take on a higher social tone. In the propaganda  whipped up around this campaign supporters advocated the careful selection of  women capable of ‘improving’ colonial societies which were considered at this  time in France to comprise felons, frauds and fruits secs. But the presence of  these women was also a means to an end: the production of a new generation of  children capable of upholding and performing Frenchness authentically in a way  that critics argued mixed-race children born of unions between male colonials  and native women were not.
 British doctors and hygienists in Hong Kong and Singapore dwelt primarily on tropicality as a threat to population quality to be resolved by an early return to the  metropole. Assumptions about gender in empire and the imperative of return led  them to concede somewhat greater authority to mothers over their own children.  By contrast, in Hanoi and Saigon some experts identified the management of  childhood in the tropics as fundamental to aspirations that empire might form  part of a project of national regeneration. Hence, at a time when in the metro- pole French men increasingly conceded responsibility for their children to an  emerging partnership between women and the interventionist republican state,  in colonial contexts where the state was weaker and culture was more male-dom- inated and masculinist, experts and fathers reasserted paternal responsibility for  colonial childhood.
 Cultural Contagions: Children in the Colonial home s In the late imperial era childrearing came to be identified as exemplary of moral  order and good governance came to be more closely linked to domestic values.  The home emerged as a site of colonial power, and in the process children took  on a social and cultural significance that far outstripped their numerical presence  in the tropics. As adults recast children as exemplars of supposedly homogeneous  national cultures, their actions within the home—their encounters with native  servants, nursemaids, and others—began to attract interest at the highest levels  of colonial society. As we have seen, hygienists, some of whom viewed children as  ‘perfected degenerates’ and others as ‘acclimated auxiliaries,’ became deeply con- cerned with childrearing practices. And yet these experts were only too well aware  that they lacked influence over the shape and structure that colonial childhoods  ultimately took within the home. In practice, as this chapter argues, childhood in  colonial contexts was profoundly porous, mixed and disruptive of the very claims  for racial homogeneity that it was called upon to impart.
 To be sure, such checks constantly broke down. For instance, European chil- dren overcame incomprehension by learning Asian languages or pidgin English.  Some taught their amahs European languages too. Though common languages emerged, Europeans checked amahs’ authority by denigrating these as essentially  ‘childish.’ From the mid-nineteenth century, Canton pidgin English was frequent- ly derided by European observers as a “gross caricature of the language of the  nursery” and a “barbarous and childish patois.”25 By construing pidgin, which  by the turn of the century had all but disappeared from commercial domains, as  an essentially childish tongue used in the home, commentators accommodated  it within British elite assumptions about childhood as a separate ‘world,’ distinct  from that of adults.
 In this regard, the child-servant relationship mirrored the child-environment  relationship discussed in Chapter 2. Since Asian servants were often regarded as  ‘outgrowths’ of this environment, this is hardly surprising. Both relationships  locked children into a trajectory leading inevitably to degeneracy and the end  of innocence. But both were also ultimately productive of British elite colonial  culture. They affirmed middle-class women’s elite status and underpinned the  orthodoxy of sending children ‘Home.’ This allowed colonial homes to remain  primarily spaces of childhood. The adolescent in the colonial home by contrast  embodied the alarming prospect that intimate relations set down across lines of  class and race might persist into adulthood. Lord Northcliffe, visiting Singapore,  summed this problem up quite succinctly, and its solution, when he noted: “The  European children here seem happy. I saw them playing today guarded by their  Chinese or Malay amahs of whom they are very fond. These nurses spoil them,  however, and they have to be ordered home when they are seven years of age.”36
 In Hong Kong, Singapore and other contexts, childhood had come to be close- ly linked to moral reform. In effect, the colonial childhood rested upon theories  of disease conflating physical and moral health and dirtiness. These produced the  Chinese child as distinct, as the quote from Phoebe May above illustrates. With  purity under threat, from outside and inside, ideal childhood required displace- ment beyond the impure. Prophylactic measures intended to control microbes,  pathogens and disease vectors focused upon the invasive agency of the Asian (and Eurasian) child. The resulting interventions underpinned assumptions that  ‘public’ health was secured in domestic spaces. But paradoxically, as this view of  childhood was elaborated trans-colonially, it produced efforts toward the hy- gienic regulation of the home in British contexts that were notably less didactic  than in Saigon and Hanoi.
 In January 1861 F. R. Kendall, an agent for the Peninsular and Oriental Steam  Navigation Company resident in Singapore observed, “No one here seems to take  an interest in Christmas somehow. . . . There is nothing to remind one of the sea- son at all.”5 When Charles Buckley organised his first Christmas gathering a few  years later it drew only twenty participants, mostly from his small Sunday school  class at St. Andrew’s Church. However, the celebration soon began to attract wider  interest. Buckley’s philanthropic gesture resonated among members of the small  merchant-dominated community as it gave greater public prominence to a cer- tain idea of British leadership and civil values at a moment when Singapore’s  elite was seeking to draw closer to London. Singapore had long been an Indian  dependency, but by the mid-1860s its merchants were petitioning London for  separate Crown Colony status. Before the onset of formal colonial rule in 1867 the  shared ambition to break free of rule by the East India Company sustained the early development of collaborative interethnic relations between European elites,  Chinese merchants (towkay) and English-speaking ‘Straits Chinese.’ In Singapore,  permanent communities of Chinese (mainly of Hokkien descent) predated for- mal British rule, as did the ‘Peranakan,’ Malay-speaking ancestors of early mi- grants from Penang and Malacca. Though they had resided in port cities of Asia  for centuries and married into Malay communities, this group retained aspects  of Chinese identity. However, many Chinese emigrants who settled also became  part of an Anglophone community and took on key roles in the growing admin- istrative and commercial life of the city. For example, Chinese merchants emerged  as members of government boards and voluntary institutions and as justices of  the peace. The Singapore Chamber of Commerce, the only formal organisation  of the early colonial period, created in February 1837 to communicate with the  London government, was open to all.6
 Far from confining themselves to domestic interiors, educated women were at  this time taking an increasingly prominent role in public.33 In British elite culture  new notions of childhood, sentimentalised and sacralised, were an accompani- ment to the domestic ideal of womanhood. The stark contrast between this elite  norm and the ‘waifs and strays,’ ‘hooligans’ or ‘street arabs’ who could not live  up to it galvanised a flurry of action intended to improve the condition of poor  children. Evangelical reformers increasingly saw their own children as adjuncts  in a battle to reverse the secularisation of society, and to raise its moral tone.  The initiatives of middle-class organisers such as the Boys’ Clubs and Institute  movement that had emerged in London in the 1870s and the Boys’ Brigade (1883)  reflected the desire to tap the energies of children and to address the yawning class  divide. Some feared that if evangelical zeal did not infect the younger generation  of ‘smart little children,’ momentum would be lost.
 Carabelli’s proposal and the response it received were also significant for the  light they shed upon a wider and increasingly bitter battle over whom or what  Indochina was actually for. In the metropole republicans and Catholics had by  now drawn battle lines penetrating the home. For each, the family offered a model around which society might be reorganised, and children figured prom- inently in their competing visions of the nation. For republicans children were  model democratic citizens-in-training, as the antislavery campaigner Victor  Schœlcher had famously suggested.59 For Catholics the family was a space for  the socialising of children and countering secularism. In a context of growing  religious strife in France the influential work of the late mining engineer and  conservative sociologist Frédéric Le Play informed a rising tide of right-wing  criticism blaming the decline of patriarchy upon an effeminising, egalitarian  republic.60 As J. P. Daughton has shown, these debates also played out at one  remove in colonial space. And here, in centres where patriarchal ideologies re- mained deeply ingrained, the colonial government’s willingness to entertain  notions of children as partners or auxiliaries of the state raised fears over a direct  threat to Catholic authority.61
 revolutionary philosophical tradition, from the ‘assimilationist’ approach of Paul  Bert to the more aloof ‘association’ of Jules Harmand. Casting the colonised as  a child sidestepped the oxymoron of an aristocratic republican rule and neatly  encapsulated the shift away from assimilation toward an associative line.
 Young people’s prominence in the public disturbances of the postwar era  posed a special problem for colonial elites. They had made children and child- hood symbolically central to justifications of liberal imperialism. But in the ear- ly twentieth century the young generation appeared to be leading anticolonial protest. Reform-minded Asian elites grasped for the symbolism of childhood  as they pursued nation-building agendas. Moreover, newly created international  organisations, in particular the League of Nations in Geneva (founded in January  1920), championed universal ideals of childhood as a basis upon which to rebuild  the postwar order. Drawing at times upon the moral leverage of such new inter- national agencies, Asian reformers highlighted disparities between Western and  non-Western childhoods and critiqued prewar narratives of empire as paternal  and benevolent. These criticisms exposed the peril of building justifications of  liberal governmentalities around appeals to unstable categories of youth.
 In the years before Duy Tân came to the throne, the conditions that led French  officials to arrange his accession took shape. At the turn of the century, cross-bor- der links with Canton, ironically facilitated by French modernisation projects, enabled young reform-minded individuals to tap into new ideas about mod- ernisation in the restive territories of northern Vietnam. The Qing emperor’s  abortive ‘Hundred Days Reform’ of China from 1898 provided inspiration. These  reforms resonated with special force among young intellectuals in northern Vi- etnam because here Chinese cultural influence remained evident in Vietnamese  traditions, institutions and beliefs. The ongoing battle for reform in China con- tinued to inspire young antiforeign and reform-minded elements in Vietnam  who were convinced that the limits of traditional sociopolitical organisation had  been reached.
 In the early 1920s, in centre after centre organisers struggled to start league  branches up again or closed them down definitively. In Singapore the Ministering  Children’s League shrank back within the confines of St. Andrew’s Cathedral be- fore finally closing in the autumn of 1923, with “no hope of revival.”27 In Penang,  the branch closed in 1922 but reopened in 1924, though by the early 1930s its  membership had slipped to just thirty children. This mirrored a general decline  in the organisation’s global membership to four hundred branches and 24,000  members and associates by 1924.
 Social networks linked the Kuk with the Tung Wah ‘Chinese Hospital,’ the ultimate  symbol of elite Chinese philanthropy in Hong Kong. Within and around these  institutions a coherent, local and mostly self-made elite emerged. As Elizabeth  Sinn has shown, many of its members saw philanthropy as “an instrument that  makes financial worth symbolically equivalent to moral worth” and believed that  the “dispensation of charity legitimises the accumulation of wealth.”37 The dy- namism of the league in Hong Kong following the admission of Chinese girls to  its structures reflected its value to these wealthy entrepreneurs. Class may have  failed to function as a bridge to interracial mixing in other social settings, as John  Carroll has shown (and Chinese continued to be excluded from European club  memberships for adults), but the league offered a space where elite Chinese and  European children could act as something closer to equals.38
 As the colonial government’s interventions in areas such as immigration pol- icy raised fears among Chinese that their interests and privileges were being en- croached upon, spokesmen for the Straits Chinese used Baby Shows to reassert  their claims upon modern, elite standards of living. Those who took up this task  were, significantly, among the most forward-looking and intellectually engaged  sections of Chinese society. The Nanyang Chinese Students Society (with the  support of the Children’s Aid Society) emerged to take over the running of Baby  Shows in Singapore by 1934. The events modelled a radically denaturalised, trans- formative conception of Chineseness predicated upon the disciplined hygienic  modernness of the child, and a vision of the family as a unit of consumption  and not only production.69 Chinese organisers proved far less anxious to insulate  children and childhood against the commercial orientation of the shows. Held  at the site of the Great World Cabaret, fancy dress competitions, concerts and  commercial goings-on all but overshadowed the medical authority on display.
 ‘generat ional tensions’ :   saigon and the semaines  de l’enfance As wider tensions unsettled established iconographies of colonial childhood,  new visions emerged to shore up the administration’s disintegrating moral claims for empire. The most important centre in this was again Saigon, as the principal  venue for open intellectual critiques of colonialism. Because Saigon’s elites resided  in a colony, not a protectorate, more liberal-minded residents anticipated their  city might play a key role in evidencing ‘progress.’ Here Cochinchinese elites used  public print media and other means to discuss international affairs, and there  had long been a greater sense of contact with Europe. Urban intellectuals also  wrote about the extremes of wealth and poverty they observed. They refracted  their reflections through new political lenses as they engaged with the question  of how France was treating the races whose progress it championed. A rising  tide of criticism, both French and Vietnamese, provided a mutual stimulus to  philanthropic action.83
 intimate heights: Children, Nature and Colonial urban planning s In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Europeans looked to the man- agement of the middle-class home and public displays of children in new rituals to  evidence a general reordering of empires along more ‘moral’ lines. But as children  migrated toward the epicentre of colonialisms’ cultures, elites extrapolated ideals  of childhood from the home into planning policies launched from the highest  levels of the colonial state. In particular, stakeholders marshalled childhood be- hind deeply controversial projects for the segregation of space. Demands for racial  enclaves turned quite explicitly upon the needs of children, or more specifically  what adults defined as their needs. The management of space emerged as another  crucial domain in which elite ideals of childhood linked up with colonial policy  and transformed the relationship of empire.
 However, this new disease paradigm never entirely overcame indifference and  even resistance within the Colonial Office and the colonies. New theories of the  vectoral propagation of disease only slowly won adherents in the colonies. Be- cause bacteriology connoted special expertise and planning at one remove, it sat  uneasily with the pragmatism that the British claimed to cherish in their empire.  The new perspective from the laboratory—hidden in the field—was one that  allowed foreign experts to rival the authority of administrators. It jarred with  desires to hem back social commitments by the state, and conflicted with visions  of imperial authority grounded in established environmental interpretations of  racial vulnerability, and their associated hierarchies. Instead of bringing about ex- tensive investment in public health, these new findings therefore often informed  planning interventions that shored up established orthodoxies. One of them was  that safety lay in the imposition of greater social and physical distance, not simply  between coloniser and colonised but between wealthier and less wealthy sections  of the populace.10 As planners sought to realise prophylactic segregation in major  centres in British Asia, these tensions inspired a revival of enclaves built around  the fragile, contested constituency of the European child.
 Claud Severn and his successors were well aware that measures intended to  split ‘settler’ sentiment might incur the wrath of elite Chinese. However, they seem  to have remained optimistic that the most important sections of Chinese opinion  would ultimately accept another reservation. This was perhaps partly because, as  we saw in Chapter 5, childhood was by this time reaching new levels of significance  as the focal point of a vibrant culture of elite, interethnic collaboration.74
 The presence of agricultural colonists had a far-reaching impact upon the  social tone of expatriate communities. Planters had grown accustomed to seeing  themselves as a kind of ‘landed gentry’ in British Malaya. However, as rubber pric- es bottomed out, their growing precariousness compelled them to divest many  trappings of elite family life. They cancelled plans to take home leave and to send  children home to be educated. As the crisis lengthened, planters complained of  feeling that “most married people are to be marooned here for ever.”115 In these  circumstances some began to emphasise a more radical line and they marshalled  dystopic visions of the degenerate European child behind a campaign for eco- nomic redress.
 After writing again to the Straits Times on 24 September to condemn confessional  groups, Allan (or his associates) drew the row to the attention of the Protestant  Educational Institute in London (established to ‘fight Popery’ in England), which  took up the case with the Colonial Office.18 The Colonial Office demanded that  the governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Frederick Weld, make a full report to  colonial secretary, Edward Stanhope, on 24 January 1887.
 As we can see, in the face of provocative claims for the toleration of child slavery  across Asia, British and French officials developed quite similar, defensive re- sponses. As moral reform swept onto the metropolitan agenda, in Britain after the  outcry over the Contagious Diseases Acts and the scandal created by W. T. Stead’s  exposé on child prostitution or “white slavery,” and in France as successive gov- ernments sought to establish the secular values of a modernising republicanism,  European and Asian merchants in empire centres feared these revelations might provoke heavy-handed metropolitan intervention. So too did colonial officials  keen to preserve stability and to avoid ‘unnecessary’ expenditure. However, flat  denials that slavery could not exist where it had no legal status were no longer suf- ficient. Therefore, instead of attacking what Smale, Allan, Silvestre and Landes had  all identified as linked practices of child cession, domestic servitude and brothel  slavery, colonial governments eschewed abolitionist intervention and played for  time or used orientalist arguments to deflect criticism.
 Effectively sinicising what was patently a community-wide problem required  more careful official oversight in more ethnically plural Singapore than it did  in Hong Kong. Consequently, in Singapore the Kuk came to be seen not as a  Chinese philanthropic initiative but as “a Government scheme worked by the  Chinese Protectorate.”27 Acting colonial secretary C.W.S. Kynnersley boasted, “No  Chinaman is employed in a position of authority higher than a Revenue officer  or a detective.”28 And while European suspicions of the Po Leung Kuk in Hong  Kong resulted in a critical enquiry into its work, when Elizabeth Andrew and the American medical missionary Dr. Katherine Bushnell complained in 1894 that “a  systematic slave trade in girls exists at Singapore,” the government flatly refused  an enquiry into the Straits Kuk.29
 The Colonial Office was prepared to accept this line, but in the febrile postwar  context reform-minded evangelical progressives infused with the sense that the  moment for change had arrived, were not. Soon after, Hugh Haslewood, a lieuten- ant commander of the Royal Navy posted to the Naval Chart Depot, and his wife,  Clara, who arrived in the colony in the summer of 1919, emerged as vociferous  critics of the phenomenon. Alerted to the issue by a sermon delivered at St. John’s  Cathedral on the subject of girl bond servants, Clara Haslewood publicised their  plight by writing a series of letters to Hong Kong newspapers castigating colonial  authorities for tolerating “child slavery.”58
 Frustrated by their inability to undermine this defence, the Haslewoods began  to emphasise the mui tsai system as synonymous with the abuse of young children.  By focusing on a specific, age-related vulnerability, they linked their cause to a  lively contemporaneous debate over adoption in Britain and abuses stemming  from regulatory shortcomings.60 By locating bond service at the extreme end of a  range of objectionable forms of labour impacting upon children under colonial  rule, they also connected their campaign to noisy, concurrent condemnations of  child labour in other colonial contexts, notably evangelical-led protests in other  major centres along the China coast.61 These aligned neatly with the critiques of  influential experts in Geneva keen to monitor colonial governments’ ‘civilising’  claims.
 The Haslewoods tapped into a narrative of child rescue that had special reso- nance in the British metropolitan context. From the 1830s, British reformers’ as- sertions that every child had the right to an ideal childhood advanced in conjunc- tion with demands for labour reform. In struggles to extend legislative protection  and free, compulsory education, reformers constructed childhood as vulnerable  and ideally noneconomic, protected and happy. Evidence of the denial of this ideal  presented moral reformers with a powerful tool. And as the Haslewoods and their  supporters drew upon the emotive weight of the unfree child, the momentum  began to shift in their favour.62
 The Hong Kong government and its defenders were on difficult ground. Leo  Amery, undersecretary of state for the colonies, found himself defending bond  service as a customary ‘unfreedom’ comparable to that of a ‘normal’ British child- hood, arguing, “I do not think that even in this country either adopted or other  children can always get away as freely as they would like, and perhaps that is  sometimes a good thing for them.”65 Amery’s point was that the notion of a ‘free’  child was nonsensical, predicated as it was upon the suspension of liberty within  the authoritarian structure of the family. However, equating the ideal childhood  in Britain to bond service in China was risky at a time when reformers were draw- ing attention to the most lurid aspects of the mui tsai system and childhood had  emerged at the forefront of liberal internationalist efforts to reshape the postwar  order. Moreover, by now in Hong Kong an increasingly vociferous ‘Anti–Mui Tsai  Society’ (established in September 1921) led by Chinese Christians with support  from local labour guilds was undermining a defence based upon cultural sensi- tivity to ‘Chinese’ norms and values. Dismantling the mui tsai system was a key  goal of nationalists and Christian Chinese who identified childhood as crucial to  nation building. In August the same year, Dr. Yeung Shiu Chuen, who became the  society’s secretary, attacked the system as inimical to Chinese ‘prestige’ and ‘civili- sation,’ and as “producing a low grade nation.”66 In 1922 the group appealed to the  Legislative Council for abolition on the grounds that mui tsai were slaves. With  the orientalist defence in tatters the government in London finally decided to act.
 This shift came about in part because, as Rachel Leow has also argued, the  report presented new evidence that unfree child labour existed not only among  Chinese but also among others, notably the Malay.83 The trans-racial dimensions  of this problem had long been known, as revealed by the case of Elizabeth above.  So what prompted the government to dispense with the older convenience of  the orientalist mui tsai strategy and to embrace the report? Crucially, by the late 1930s new circumstances connected the fate of unpaid child labourers to wider  debates over public health, the controversial issue of the Singapore naval base and  the ‘United Malaya’ project. In 1919 embarrassing revelations of the government’s  toleration of brothels led to metropolitan criticism of Singapore as the ‘Cesspool  of the East.’84 The government would eventually ban prostitution in 1927 and make  brothels illegal in 1930. But these measures did not prevent venereal disease and  they motivated the pugnacious Straits Settlements Association and its allies to  launch public attacks upon brothel closure. These campaigners rejected the ‘ex- pertise’ of ‘do-gooders’ “sitting at the other side of the world” and even demanded  the reenactment of the Contagious Diseases Ordinance.85
 In a context where serious political concessions were impossible the gov- ernment by now urgently required new evidence to underpin its claims to be a  ‘benevolent bureaucracy.’88 However, this need stemmed less from the need to  address Chinese protests than from desires to accelerate ‘decentralisation,’ a policy  intended to bring the Malay Peninsula more closely under British control. Much  earlier, in 1926, Governor Laurence Guillemard (1919–27) had set out this goal by  insisting that the “various parts of Malaya can only attain their full development  by working together as members of one united Malaya.”89 Picton-Turbervill’s re- port emerged at a time when Governor Shenton Thomas sought a means of ad- dressing both the political controversy of the ‘Social Question’ and the challenge  of unification.
 This was why, when the furore over mui tsai had risen again in 1929, officials  in Hong Kong had leapt to ‘fairyland’s’ defence. G.E.J. Gent of the Colonial Of- fice received reports of new voluntary initiatives, pushing out the boundaries of  charitable child welfare still further. These included the establishment of a Hong  Kong branch of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children  (NSPCC).96 Others, such as the police-run Waifs and Strays club, also emerged as  part of this defensive reaction. The governor of Hong Kong, Sir Cecil Clementi, a  staunch opponent of the compulsory inspection of mui tsai, presided at the inau- gural meeting of Hong Kong’s branch of the SPCC in January 1930. According to  him, the allocation of funds demonstrated the colonial government’s attachment  of “so much importance to this matter [the protection of children].”97 Soon after,  Clementi left Hong Kong to take up the governorship of the Straits Settlements,  but he continued to describe the mui tsai legislation as a disaster for poor children,  whom he believed were better catered for as bond servants within the elite family.98
 Official histories of Hong Kong emerging in the 1930s set up paternal coun- terclaims to female reformers’ demands by recasting British colonial governance  within a surprisingly sentimental frame. Officials here had long eschewed meta- phors of nature or kinship in preference for a discourse of development as ration- al, technologically competent progress. This had often portrayed Hong Kong as a  triumph over nature, a ‘barren rock’ transformed into a showcase of British-led  modernisation.99 Now, however, officials began to indulge in paternal referenc- es to the Crown Colony’s former ‘infancy.’ It was significant that their gaze was  retrospective, that they claimed to be looking back on the child-colony from the  perspective of a present in which it was already ‘mature’ (in contrast to a young  and turbulent China over the border). For such views negated justifications for external intervention and ushered female reformers towards the anachronistic  position of belittling a colony that had already ‘grown up.’100
 Part of the reason was because religious authorities in France, Hanoi and Sai- gon were far less inclined than their British equivalents to use evidence of ‘unfree’  children to attack the colonial government. Historians reflecting on the charac- teristics of antislavery movements more generally, prior to and during this peri- od, have contrasted a powerful British antislavery movement possessing a broad,  evangelical mass power base with a French equivalent suffering from long-stand- ing divisions.119 Certainly, the establishment of Cardinal Lavigerie’s Anti-Slavery  Society in 1888 had seen the French Catholic Church overcome associations of  abolition with revolution to emerge at the forefront of a reinvigorated metropol- itan antislavery movement. However, the society focused its efforts largely upon  western and equatorial Africa—areas of empire where Christian influence had yet  to be consolidated—not Indochina, where the French Catholic presence in Asia  long predated, and inspired, formal colonial rule.
 Moreover, as the republican state rolled back clerical privilege at home, rep- resentatives of the Church preferred to work tactfully, not confrontationally,  alongside authorities in the colonies.120 In Saigon and Hanoi religious authorities  enjoyed support from influential figures within the administration and used sub- tle pressure rather than open propaganda to address controversial social issues.121  The Anti-Slavery Society adopted a notably emollient tone in correspondence  with Governor Albert Sarraut, dismissing allegations that slavery was still tolerat- ed in Indochina.122 Perhaps this is unsurprising, since the society’s president from  11 October 1909 was none other than Charles-Marie Le Myre de Vilers, Cochinchi- na’s first civil governor, who had failed to act on Silvestre and Landes’s calls to  openly confront child slavery.
 The quite different political preoccupations of French feminist-led and  left-orientated antitrafficking organisations were also important in obstructing the emergence of a broad-based challenge to the official line. Metropolitan anti- trafficking movements (with which various feminist groups aligned) had taken  up leading positions in international efforts in this field before the First World  War. Like the British women’s movement, the French antitrafficking movement  had developed out of late-nineteenth-century fears over the abduction of women  into prostitution, or la traite des blanches. Campaigners identified the toleration of  brothel registration as the primary cause of this problem. In Britain, the success  of the women’s movement in achieving the repeal of the Contagious Diseases  Acts encouraged a broader focus. After winning suffrage through the 1918 Rep- resentation of the People Act (at least for women over thirty), British reformers  could afford to turn their attention to improving the condition of other vulnera- ble groups, notably children, empire-wide. In contrast, French feminists suffered  repeated setbacks in the struggle for suffrage and other social and legal rights and  this severely curtailed the scope of their demands.127
 Alice Conklin has persuasively argued that the French perceived their com- mitment to safeguarding freedom in the colonies as qualitatively superior to that  of other nations. Republican France, she notes, “prided itself, and its colonialism,  as achieving, if nothing else, an end to slavery in its colonies.”136 With economic  difficulties threatening to fragment the liberal centre in Europe critical voices fell  quiet. At a time when a broad consensus was emerging in metropolitan France  that empire was quintessentially humane, even critics such as Viollis appeared to  be “inhibited by her own Republicanism” while those on the left, such as Lou- is Roubaud, vaunted colonisation as the “essential condition for success” in the  antislavery campaign, and proposed cooperation on this front between British  Malaya, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Siam.137
 From the early 1920s colonial officials had begun to slant reports sent to League  inspectors in this direction. Questionnaire replies typically indicated, “Police ac- tion is very delicate in affairs relating specifically to the Chinese.”144 If this was a problem, it was largely one of the government’s own making. From 1871 to 1885  the French authorities permitted Chinese in Indochina to establish congrégations,  organised on the basis of language and ethnicity and endowed with powers to  police, tax, assist, educate and repatriate members.145 Membership of the five large  Chinese congregations was heavily concentrated in Saigon and Cholon. When  French police did make efforts to challenge Chinese privilege and regulate vice, as  in Cholon in 1903 and 1912, community leaders’ protests ensured that such initi- atives were swiftly curtailed.146 Congregations successfully resisted the regulation  of domestic life, securing exemption from legislation registering servants in 1904  and scuppering plans for a regular immigration service in 1906.147
 British antislavery campaigners, in concert with Chinese Christians and other  reformers, exposed orientalist arguments and used universalist visions of child- hood to challenge colonial authority. Though the campaigners’ principal focus  was Hong Kong, the colonial government based in Singapore eventually moved  first to dismantle the orientalist defence and then embrace a wide-ranging com- mitment to protect the welfare of child colonial subjects. By contrast, in Saigon  and Hanoi, even after colonial government and League reports revealed direct  links between trafficking and prostitution, no similar official reevaluation of the  state’s commitment to Asian children followed. For here, evidence of ‘unfree’  children posed a more potent threat to a form of governance more closely asso- ciated with an ideology of humanitarian ethics, but also one facing anticolonial  movements rejecting the French nation as a source of benevolent enlightenment.
 From this vision of an unrealised past, segregated schools emerged as a solution  preempting a dystopic future. They would permit the realisation of an ideal of  childhood, while usefully concealing the failings of those whose performance of  it fell short.
 Leaders of the Church and missionary groups in Hong Kong found the in- troduction of flagrant racial legislation disquieting. The Anglican bishop, Joseph  Hoare, opposed the segregationist policy and resigned from the education com- mittee in protest before it even completed its work. That he should take this  view is unsurprising given religious workers’ adherence to universalist Christian  ideals presupposing the equality of children before God. Catholics opened many  schools in China but more often established orphanages, evidently influenced by  assumptions of sacramental grace; that baptism in infancy equated to salvation.  A romantic Catholic tradition of childhood elaborated in the aftermath of the  French Revolution sometimes figured baptised children as a pure spiritual force.  As D. E. Mungello has shown using the example of the promotional materials  of the Holy Childhood Association, such a view could efface racial divisions be- tween children rather than undergirding them. Evangelical Protestants of the  LMS and the low-church Anglican ‘Church Missionary Society’ did not always  accept Catholic claims of sacramental grace, and preferred to emphasise Bible  study as a route to salvation and belief in adulthood. However, as evangelical  opinion had hoved away from uncritical acceptance of the doctrine of original  sin, childhood also emerged as an ideal site for Protestant action, for the ‘rescue’  and reform of individuals, and their preparation for doing the work of God.63
 In these empire centres debates surrounding education raised children’s  awareness of age as a key category of experience and societal transformation. For  many young Chinese, events in Paris on 4 May 1919 lit the touch paper. The refus- al of the Allies to support Chinese claims for the restitution of Kiachow triggered  the May Fourth Movement. This spilled over into Singapore where Chinese stu- dents took to the streets on 19 June 1919. The government imposed martial law.  After this Chinese students conspicuously refused to celebrate the Allied victory  on 19–20 July 1919. In 1917 the introduction of guoyu (National Language) in  teaching at Chinese schools, such as the one funded by Tan Kah Kee and Lim Nee  Soon, revealed links between diasporic Chinese youth and the new republican  government of China. This raised fears that the Communist-influenced Kuo- mintang government in Canton held sway over the students. As revolutionaries  brought in antiforeign texts, schools became battlegrounds for the Kuomintang  and the Chinese Communist Party. The self-identification of children as ‘youth’  raised the possibility of links across a ‘generation’ incorporating workers and stu- dents of both sexes in an alliance of age.
 Moreover, lurking behind Brévié’s vision of a racially plural but culturally  French elite was the assumption that ‘pure’ French youth would quite “natural- ly” take the lead. In 1939 the official report on the “General Conclusions of the  Inquiry on the Child of Indochina” reiterated this quite explicitly by stipulating  that French youth had “a great role of initiative to play” in working up what was  described as a “kind of colonisation infantile.”130 This vision of leadership by youth  would be given much fuller expression after July 1940 under the pro-Vichy regime  of Governor General Jean Decoux.131
 The solution Haffner proposed to this problem lay in the very gardens under  his direction. In a detailed plan sent to the lieutenant governor of Cochinchina,  Augustin Fourès, he sought funding for what he called an ‘agricultural orphanage.’  Haffner proposed an experiment in which Eurasian youth would be schooled in  the Botanical Gardens to become a new cadre of farmers. ‘His’ orphans, taught  en paillote in a four-year course, would learn techniques that would enable them  to bring the fertile lands of the heights and plains into productive relation. This,  Haffner hoped, would solve the familiar problem of finding new crops suitable  for export (the only really successful export so far was rice, a fact which he blamed  on indigenous cultivators’ innate conservatism). The director felt sure young Eur- asians would become willing experimenters and a “leader class in agriculture.”  An additional benefit was that they would not suffer the same deleterious effects  as ‘full-blooded’ Europeans through exposure to the environment. As ‘hybrids’  themselves, Haffner also somehow imagined the orphans would be more ‘natural- ly’ predisposed to mastery of the techniques of greffe la selection and hybridisation.  And by lessening French reliance upon the Chinese and disseminating modern  techniques among the Vietnamese, he argued they would help to improve colonial  relations. Rounding off this unsettling combination of domestic and imperial  economics, Haffner argued that the harvests the orphans produced would ensure  that the whole project paid for itself after just a few years.9
 Because the society was voluntary and did not depend upon government fund- ing, it not only won official sponsorship but could also gesture toward quite radical  aims, such as ‘emancipating’ the métis into Frenchness, that is, full citizenship.13 A  speech by the president of the ‘active committee,’ Nicolaï, published in the journal  Mékong on 20 May 1894, identified the métis as the potential basis of colonial society  for “it is there, among the offspring of our elders that we will find the heart, the  soul of our new France, this new France that, today, we have the duty of raising in  our own image, kneaded from our own flesh and blood.”14 Even Lanessan praised  this philanthropic effort, “embodying the work of concord and fusion,” the assimi- lative genre of colonialism for which Saigon was well known.15 The local press also  celebrated the Saigon oeuvre for demonstrating that the French presence in Asia  was flexible and absorptive in contrast to a British equivalent that was aloof and  austere, a “foreign body in the organism . . . threatened from one day to the next  with expulsion.”16 Evidently, similar concerns were emerging in Hanoi around the  same time, for the head of the Post Office, a member of the Public Works Depart- ment and a pharmacist together created a society there in 1897 with related aims.17
 Liberal reflections upon mixed-race people as worthy beneficiaries of state  support in the colonies derived not only from an inclusive notion of British impe- rial subjecthood based upon blood, but of the Eurasian as a child. Colonial visions  of ‘rootless’ and ‘culturally lost’ children connected with dystopic metropolitan  ideas of childhood split along the lines of a racialised class difference. But by  the 1880s impressions of street children in the metropole had shifted away from  midcentury assumptions of irretrievable racial alterity. As a wave of Christian  voluntary institutions led a drive for social purity in the face of growing secular- isation, every child came to be seen as potentially salvageable, capable of being  rescued to ‘true childhood.’ Re-exported to empire, such contentions obviously  threatened the practical consideration of running colonies such as Hong Kong on  a shoestring (the Colonial Office expected Crown Colonies to be self-sufficient).  So in response to Smale’s intervention, Governor John Pope Hennessy summoned  expert opinion. On his behalf, the German missionary from the London Mis- sionary Society, Ernst J. Eitel, who was also inspector of schools, explained that  for decades Eurasians had taken full advantage of the educational infrastructure.  Many boys had studied English within the colony’s schools. He noted that the boys are invariably sent to the Government Central school where they generally distin- guish themselves, and as a rule these boys obtain good situations in Hongkong, in the  open ports and abroad. The girls crowd into the schools kept by Missionary Societies.
 Indeed, the sense of reciprocity between Europeans and Eurasians in Singapore  spilled over into paternal gestures within the emerging voluntary sphere. French  and Spanish Catholics engaged heavily in social work among this group. As part  of an Anglican-oriented response, C. B. Buckley’s philanthropic ‘Christmas Treat’  celebrated and succoured the Christian children of poorer Eurasian families, in  particular those attending the colony’s schools and those with links to St. An- drew’s Cathedral.47 Consequently, if there was a ‘Singapore childhood’ on display  in the Treat from the late 1860s onward, Eurasian children were in large part its  public embodiment—though this group was never explicitly separated out and  defined as such, but instead fit within an overarching, plural vision of childhood.
 However, while racial intermediacy appears to have been less heavily proscribed  in Singapore for longer, around the turn of the century a variety of state-imposed  reforms imperilled the privileges that Eurasians had carved out in colonial soci- ety. When young Eurasians attempted a patriotic gesture by forming a Volunteer  Corps in August 1897, C. P. Lucas at the Colonial Office revealed that the colonial  secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, “strongly expressed” the view that such a develop- ment was “undesirable.”48 In 1904, Governor Sir John Anderson formally barred  ‘non-Europeans’ from senior appointments in the Straits administration.49 In  1910 another ruling barred Asians and Eurasians from administrative posts in the civil service, forcing them into inferior grades (as mechanics, typists, clerks  and train drivers).
 Whilst in Hong Kong exclusionary practices had prompted the odd letter  to the editor, in Singapore completely new journals or newspapers emerged to  serve as mouthpieces through which Eurasians could respond to this provoca- tion. Though these were often short lived, as in the case of the Singapore Eurasian  Advocate (1888–91), they sought to define and promote a discrete community and  its demands. After 1904 Eurasian interest groups also began to cohere around  public meetings held to protest the colour bar. One produced a petition that was  despatched to the British Parliament.50 Churches also provided an institutional  focus around which such energies found expression. Wealthy, elite Eurasians (of  the so-called double ten) had established early links with philanthropic culture as  patrons, but also noteworthy in this climate was the emergence of a new ‘genera- tion’ of Eurasian youth making more assertive demands in defence of what they  defined as their ‘community’s’ interests.
 Caught in the midst of this bitter debate, métis protection societies had given up  radical assimilationist positions but now sought to emphasise the importance of  their work by recasting Eurasians as vulnerable children.
 In the crisis, the paradigm of ‘maturity’ proved valuable both in interpreting  policy to London and in developing new bases for collaborative relations with  the Chinese elite. John Carroll has argued that a long-standing, carefully culti- vated and profound social distance separated Hong Kong’s British and Chinese  elites.94 However, from 1911, as we have seen, spectacular celebrations of childhood  bridged this social divide. During the war these efforts proceeded in new formats,  such as bazaars. In peacetime, Governor Stubbs’s wife, who was president of the  Ministering Children’s League, refashioned it into an umbrella organisation en- compassing much other philanthropic work. Because of this, child-centric vol- untary work exemplified and distinguished a ‘mature’ civility, and the language  of age emerged as one that Eurasians could draw upon to articulate a sense of  shared Anglo-Chinese interests in times of unrest.
 As the Great Depression hit Hong Kong from 1929 and competition for clerical  positions intensified, younger Eurasians became more keenly aware of the lack  of any ‘community’ leadership capable of defending their interests. This was per- haps unsurprising given that so many of the wealthy Eurasian elite had aligned  themselves with Chineseness. The problems of the younger generation were quite  different. And some now felt the need to create new institutions capable of pro- tecting their distinctive needs and concerns. An important example was the phil- anthropic ‘Welfare League’ (or Tongren hui), which held its first general meeting  in July 1930. Though Sir Robert Ho Tung served as president, the real energy was  supplied by younger members such as the thirty-seven-year-old solicitor Lo Man  Kam and Charles Graham (Carl) Anderson, the league’s secretary, who was in his  early forties.103 In a speech announcing this initiative, Anderson, who had been  born in Hong Kong to Eurasian parents, defended the notion of a Eurasian ‘com- munity.’ He located its essence not in terms of race or civilisation but maturity,  good citizenship and a fusion of blood. As he put it: We feel we are a community. . . . It has been said of us that we can have no unity, and  since even the semi-civilised tribes of Africa have it, this, though palpably absurd, is a  challenge to be faced and an insult to be wiped out. . . . With the blood of Old China  mixed with that of Europe in us, we show the world that this fusion, to put it no higher,  is not detrimental to good citizenship.104
 In this appeal Anderson located maturity in blood that was figuratively ‘old.’ Ul- timately, it was the Anglo-Chinese phenotype that distinguished Eurasians from  others still arriving on the civilisational stage. However, Anderson located Eur- asians’ ‘maturity’ in the blood of ‘Old China’ rather than Europe. Even younger  Eurasians, then, seemed to hark back to an older China, one where cultural Con- fucianism afforded their fathers’ generation a less exposed position within the  overarching framework of ‘Chineseness.’ This was a rather nostalgic response, but one that is unsurprising given that it was forged in the face of conditions  of depression that were eroding privilege and hastening societal fragmentation  defined along more intensely nationalist lines.
 Because Singapore society was more obviously plural than that of Hong Kong,  in the early twentieth century official policy focused upon reinforcing divisions  between constituent groups in order to prevent unrest. Fitting all of those resi- dent within racial categories required remarkable contortions and elisions, as Joel  Kahn has shown.106 But as the colonial state undercut Eurasians’ privileges the  latter proved adept at combining strategically with other Anglophone groups to  ‘express the views of domiciled communities.’ The Malay Tribune, for example,  a newspaper started in 1914 with support from Lim Boon Keng and Eurasian  benefactors, appealed to the English-speaking of all races and provided a vehicle  for such views.107

 Ballantyne argues that the development of Aryanism as a racial ideology on the New Zealand frontier in the nineteenth century was the product of a multiplicity of transnational connections between colonial South Asia and the Pacific. Several constellations of imperial networks were par- ticularly crucial, including an emergent imperial newspaper and print culture that connected the colony to the wider world of empire, and the establishment of learned institutions, such as Theosophy and the Poly- nesian Society, which had strong and direct connections to India. But perhaps most important were well-developed migration networks that linked India and New Zealand, including a large cluster of colonial sur- veyors and foresters, who began their careers in the service of the East India Company (and later, the Government of India) before transferring to New Zealand. ‘Thus’, writes Ballantyne, ‘two elite cliques of experi- enced India hands played a pivotal role in state-sponsored colonial science and were at the forefront of the colonial project to map and demarcate land and to police its effective use’.52
 The goal of improvement and its linkage with science formed, then, a part of the mentality of the British elite in the formative period of its empire. Turning such goals into a programmatic strategy for the advance- ment of knowledge within the imperial setting required, however, a com- mitment on the part of the British state which was slow to be realized. Francis Bacon had tried in vain to interest James I in his plans for the reform of learning and many of his successors and their administrations were equally slow in embracing the view that the state should serve as a patron of scientific progress. British government had long been based on the view that the state should limit its functions as much as possible, leaving much of the day to day administration to be carried on at the local level through the voluntary service of a landowning class which accepted the need to act as Justices of the Peace and other such func- tionaries as a just return for their social position. In science, too, vol- untary service was seen as the natural way to proceed – a message underlined by the fact that at its foundation the Royal Society in 1660 received no more than a royal title and a mace from Charles II.
 Elsewhere in the British Empire, too, science formed an important part of the elite culture and its cultivation was both a mark of gentility and an espousal of the goals of improvement which formed an important part of the justification of empire.51 The growth of local scientific societies was one index of the increasing local consolidation of colonial elites. Such local scientific bodies provided an opportunity for rational amuse- ment, social and political networking and, it was hoped, the promotion of the goals of improvement. Accordingly, particular emphasis was placed on the study of possible sources of improved economic well-being – one of the major goals espoused by Jones in his presidential address on the importance of Indian science. When, for example, the Van Diemen’s Land Scientific Society was founded in 1829, it was ‘constituted … in  imitation of the Royal & other literary & scientific societies of Europe & India’, and it took as one of its major goals the ‘eliciting and discovering the properties and uses to which the vegetable productions of the island may be applied and to ascertain the improvements which may be adopted in their cultivation’.52 Its successor body, the grandly named, The Royal Society of Van Diemen’s Land for Botany, Horticulture and the Advance- ment of Body (founded in 1843 as the first Royal Society outside Britain) urged its members to promote ‘the advance of Science and the progress of the Colony’.53
 This is not to argue that ‘science’, or ‘scientists’ did not exist in Aus- tralia before the wave of exhibitions starting in the 1860s and reaching their apex two decades later by the time of the Melbourne Centennial International in 1888. That earlier history provided a foundation for science and scientists at the exhibitions, including an existing public pres- ence and at least some public authority. As noted above, scientific dis- plays alone were popular at the first two metropolitan exhibitions held in Sydney and Melbourne in 1854, primarily as a way to collect Australian exhibits for the Paris Universal Exposition one year later. Such exhibits and the participation of colonial scientists drew upon general scientific interest in the colonies. The practice of science itself was part of settle- ment from the very first British generations in the forms of mapping, mineralogy, botanical gardens, natural history, and other practical exer- cises.42 Scientific enterprise of this kind benefited from the pattern of colonial state intervention in public affairs, a precedent established dur- ing the early years of official colonization in New South Wales and Vic- toria, and consented to by even the most ‘conservative’ pastoralists and politicians.43 Scientific societies pursuing ambitious projects inevitably developed a close relationship with local, or colonial governments, such as those in the city of Melbourne and the colony of Victoria. Since many Australian politicians were active in these philosophical and scientific societies and Colonial Governors served as patrons, it is not surprising that requests for official assistance were often fulfilled, if offers them- selves were not forthcoming.44
 The institutional foundations and networks were clearly present in the young colonies of the Australian continent. Key scientists were active in public institutions, voluntary societies, perhaps even commercial life, their various positions and roles often connected and mutually reinforc- ing. Officers and staff of the major scientific collections were also major players at the exhibitions. In this way, colonial public life mirrored to a great degree English developments. John Stuart Mill noted in 1836 that England ‘is covered with associations’, or ‘societies’, including those  for political, religious, philanthropic, and scientific purposes.45 Notable among such societies were the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the provincial Mechanics’ Institutes. By mid-century, similar associations were found throughout at least eastern Australia, where  agricultural societies and mechanics’ institutes provided the Antipodean reflection of the metropole’s mid Victorian institutional image. As was the case with their British brethren, such associations in Australia offered lectures, journals, museums, libraries, and art and industrial expositions, creating the sinews of nineteenth-century local, civic, colonial and inter- colonial, or national culture, both artistic and scientific.46
 Scientists were anxious about their place in colonial society, seized by a sense of impermanence and disregard, or homelessness in all of its mean- ings. Reverend W.B. Clarke addressed such concerns in his ‘Anniversary Address’ to the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1875 amid the flurry of exhibitions in the Australian colonies, Britain, and Europe.63 Clarke was perhaps the most well-known and active geologist in the colony,  if not throughout Australasia, and his public scientific life included organ- izing exhibits, writing essays, and serving as commissioner for Australian exhibitions starting with the first Sydney Metropolitan show in 1854.
 To those ends, significant and enduring connections with other learned societies in New South Wales, across the borders in the other Australian colonies, and abroad should be pursued. The Royal Society needed to be part of the various networks potentially connecting it and its members to a wider world, both at home in its own colony and beyond the colony’s borders. Science and its public face, the Royal Society, might then become a permanent and well-funded institution, recognized as part of colonial society and generator, recipient, and representative of wider civic and national, if not imperial, interests. Science was seen as a vital connection creating and a vital metaphor representing the nation and society. It pro- vided not only a language comprehensible at home and abroad, but also the social, cultural, and intellectual authority necessary to justify public policies. Might not society and the nation work the way that science and scientists did?

 Postwar British imperialism, therefore, derived considerable practical and symbolic benefit from contact with the FAO. The Organization’s international mandate did not constitute a challenge to imperial gov- ernance per se. Indeed, the FAO accommodated the status quo of  international geopolitics through attributing to imperial powers the responsibility for colonial development. Yet despite these assurances, the FAO’s ties with colonial territories heightened governmental concerns over the sustainability of staffing late colonial administrations.
 The socio-cognitive networks of CFS members, therefore, unsettled the hierarchical channels of communication between the FAO and colonial administrations insisted upon by the Colonial Office. Neither colonial governments nor the Colonial Office itself could prevent CFS personnel from utilizing networks as a means of facilitating their trans- fer to an international civil service, despite guidelines and financial penalties for breaking contracts. The final section of this chapter draws together the various mechanisms underpinning the transfer of CFS per- sonnel to FAO employment discussed above. It offers a microlevel per- spective on the reconfiguration of career networks through the insights of practitioners involved, focusing on the two most formative modes of contact between the FAO and CFS personnel, namely FAO technical assistance projects and forestry conferences.
 Conclusion: legacy The socio-cognitive networks forged through interaction between  CFS members and FAO staff in the late colonial period jarred with the Colonial Office’s desire to delimit the flow of networks of personal connection that traversed imperial space. FAO assistance to British crown colonies simultaneously helped strengthen the ‘Second Colonial Occu- pation’ and generated fears of its demise. In an era of progressive decolon- ization, global shortages of natural resource specialists resulted in the career trajectories of colonial scientists becoming highly politicized. Yet while colonial bureaucrats railed against the FAO for the potentially cor- rosive impact of their recruitment networks on the staffing of colonial administrations, the lived experiences of rank and file practitioners who personally negotiated the material realities of late imperialism elicit the extent to which serving officers initiated extra-imperial communications. The flow of colonial foresters into FAO employment would only increase with constitutional change. Yet – with Whitehall accusations of the  FAO ‘poaching’ serving personnel resurfacing in the UK’s bilateral aid program – the end of formal empire was by no means the end of the inter-institutional frictions generated by recruitment. Continued short- ages in the availability of natural resource specialists did nothing to alle- viate these tensions.78 Where once, FAO recruitment practice had played upon Colonial Office anxieties of imperial decline, it continued to serve well into the late 1960s as an index of Britain’s waning international political influence.
 The intensification of cultural contact in the Pacific from the 1760s modified this pattern. In the central Pacific, Europeans established sus- tained relationships with a range of Polynesian societies that had developed hierarchical forms of political organization, consolidated important divisions of labour and elaborated complex sequences of ritual performances. These communities could not easily be dismissed as mere ‘savages’ lacking religion, rather the structured nature of their polities and their strong interest in trade suggested that they possessed a significant degree of cultural sophistication. Most importantly, it seemed that they were religious and in an Enlightenment Europe where orthodox theologians, deists and anti-Church philosophes were concerned with religious diversity, the ‘natural’ religions of the Pacific were of special interest.
 But in terms of social function, the two systems were similar in that they preserved the powers of the elite groups (or racial groups in India) in society, by establishing a code of ‘no-touchism’ that protected the sanctity and power of the elites from the defiling touch of the ordinary person. In both societies, these conventions, backed by the sanction  of religious authority, provided the key socio-religious structure that governed everyday life.99
 The intensely sectarian programmes of the missionaries undoubt- edly deepened these tensions. Both Wesleyan and Anglican missionar- ies drew on pre-existing Maori resentment of the French to launch anti-Catholic campaigns which were heavily reliant on print.66 In response to the establishment of the Catholic mission the CMS pro- duced Te Anakaraiti (‘The Anti-Christ’), a pamphlet labelling the Pope the Anti-Christ. This was quickly followed by two more anti-Catholic pamphlets, in the form of dialogues between Rapu Pono (Searcher for Truth) and Aroha Pono (True Love), which detailed twelve ‘errors’ of the Catholic Church.67 As a result of this anti-Catholic propaganda, Maori routinely called Jean-Baptiste Pompallier, the Catholic Bishop, the ‘Anti-Christ’.68 Pompallier reflected that the Catholic missionaries armed with ‘only our voices and our pens’ struggled as ‘heresy [i.e. the Protestant missions] had two printing presses at its command’, which allowed both the Anglicans and the Wesleyans to circulate ‘pam- phlets, tracts, and little books, which while teaching the first truths of salvation, were filled with all sorts of objections and calumnies against  the minister and the faith of the Catholic Church.’69 When W. B. Ullathorne, the English Catholic Vicar-General of Australia, visited New Zealand in 1840 to dispel the Maori belief that only the French were Catholics, he discovered that the Protestant missionaries had not only told Maori ‘fantastic stories of the old anti-Catholic type’, but that these anti-Catholic tales had been further sensationalized ‘for  the New Zealand palate’.70 But Maori were not passive pawns in a European sectarian battle fought on New Zealand soil, as they exploited these sectarian tensions by playing on Protestant fears of ‘Popery’ to demand more frequent visits from missionaries and easier access to baptism.71

 From the perspective of many groups, empires such as those ruled by the  Ottomans, Habsburgs (Austria), and Britain, could be more benign than the  ethnically based nation-states that succeeded them. Not all empires were benign  to minority ethnic groups, but many were. The British concept of imperial  civilisation included religious tolerance (up to a point) and ethnic diversity. In  addition, Britain eventually sought to end formal enslavement in its empire (and  elsewhere), although the labour situation continued to be grossly inegalitarian  on an ethnic basis in the colonies, and even more so than in the metropole.
 At the same time, there was in England a degree of public, national  engagement with territorial expansion. The development of a public politics in  England ensured that policymaking was not simply a case of the Crown but,  instead, from the early thirteenth century, involved the ‘community of the  realm’, an entity that was to be represented in parliament. As a result, what would  later be termed the public sphere played a role in the discussion of policy, both  directly and, via the impact on the raising of resources, notably troops and taxes,  indirectly. A similar process occurred in Ireland, where the conflicts played out  in the Dublin parliament, England’s first colonial legislature, helped crystallise  a distinctive colonial identity.7 However, the extent to which English public  opinion supported the longlasting intervention in France, which became more  insistent once the Hundred Years’ War had broken out in the 1330s, is unclear.

 The Development of Trans-Oceanic Imperialism In Reformation England, not only was the monarch now head of the Church,  but the Church was now depicted as representative of a chosen people with a  sense of divine mandate. Protestant England was presented as God’s New Israel,  a Protestant people and state, with all the possibilities that this depiction entailed  of defining purposes and identities separate to those of the rest of Christendom.  Cultural nationalism became stronger as a result of the Reformation, not least  the embrace of the English language and a greater commitment to Englishness.11
 Moreover, the challenge to authority represented by the Reformation was  to help lead to a view of the world in which it was easier to respond to new  information without being constrained by existing patterns of authority. This  situation looked towards the prominent English role in the Scientific Revolution  of the late seventeenth century.
 This idea of Britishness proved particularly attractive to those who stressed  a militant Protestant identity in the midst of a hostile Catholic world. At the  same time, the complex and shifting relationships between Britain, England,  Scotland, and Ireland indicated the compromises and nuances that were to  characterise much of the subsequent history of the British empire. James’ hopes  of a ‘union of love’ or, at least, a measure of administrative and economic union  between England and Scotland, were not realised, and separate parliamentary,  ecclesiastical, and legal systems continued. There were fears in England about  the legal and constitutional implications of any union, and the Westminster  parliament rejected a parliamentary or legal bond with Scotland.
 The settlers sought to create a godly agrarian world, and they believed that  their righteousness made them more entitled to the land than the natives;  although it was not only Protestant nonconformist settlers who saw natives as  savages.20 The settlers benefited from the impact on the natives of (probably) the  plague in 1616–18 and of smallpox in 1634. The effects of disease were highly  significant for the contours, and indeed character, of colonial settlement, both  in creating opportunities and in thwarting others. The separatists were followed  to New England by settlers who were not separatists, but who were also zealous  for a godly commonwealth. These more mainstream Protestants, sponsored by  the Massachusetts Bay Company established in 1629, founded Boston in 1630.
 These colonies remained closely focused on England. An emphasis on  spreading settlement can lead to an underrating of the major role of ports in  the colonies, especially of Boston, and, more particularly, the importance of  the beginning of the annual sailing season and the arrival of ships that brought  immigrants, products, money, and news from England. Their likely arrival was  the focus of continual discussion and concern in the colonies.
 of imperialism involved both the issue of commitment and, as a consequence,  political contention.
 The limited role of the Crown in supporting trans-oceanic activity helped  lessen the impact on Britain’s overseas position of the civil wars in Scotland,  Ireland, and England that broke out in 1639 lasting until 1652. However, this  impact was still serious. Moreover, the challenge to established assumptions  about the conduct of government posed both by Charles I, and by some of his  critics, manifested itself in the colonies as well as in the British Isles. In 1638,  Massachusetts refused an order to submit its charter for scrutiny and slighted  the condemnation of the charter by the Privy Council. Charles was considering  a forceful response when the crisis of authority in Scotland gathered pace.  Within New England, there were also tensions over authority, with Connecticut  and Rhode Island being founded as breakaway settlements from Massachusetts  in response to differences over church government. Eventual parliamentary  success in the civil wars, however, ensured that the empire held together; and  this uniformity in outcome was continued during the subsequent turmoil of the  seventeenth century.
 Thus, New England, with its Puritanism, urban character, and (albeit  limited) democratic practices, in part drew on different traditions to the  more Episcopalian, rural, and hierarchical society that was established round  the Chesapeake. To understand both, it is necessary to appreciate the varied  character of English social development. In the case of seventeenth-century  Maryland and Virginia, both of which then focused on the Chesapeake, most  settlers were English by birth and upbringing, they established a society based  on English laws, government, and economic organisation, and they brought  traditional English attitudes towards the social order and religious practices.  However, in the case of the Chesapeake, immigration from England greatly  slackened from the 1690s, and social contrasts became more marked. This  development was linked to a demographic shift in which, thanks to a decline in  death rates, the percentage of native-born inhabitants rose. This led to a better  balance of men and women, early marriages, and thus more children. A greater  separateness from England emerged.48 Colonies settled later, notably, from the  1730s, Georgia and, from the 1760s (East and West) Florida, did not have time  to experience the same change to the same degree.
 the Crown over the governments of Barbados and Massachusetts was increased,  while, in 1677–79, abortive plans were drafted to make legislation in Virginia  and Jamaica dependent on the assent of parliament. From his accession in 1685,  James II of England and VII of Scotland’s attempt to impose autocracy clashed,  in both Britain and the colonies, with the corporate ideal of government, as  well as with a Protestant suspicion of the intentions of the Catholic monarch  whatever his claims to grant religious toleration. He was also brought down by  his maladroit handling of people. Circumstances worked against James: he was  unable to mould them or to respond adequately.
 The ‘Glorious Revolution’ was followed, in both England and the colonies,  by the implementation of a new order that included a measure of religious  toleration as well as an extension of government based on the Westminster  parliament; Ireland and Scotland still had their separate parliaments. This  extension was seen with the revised Navigation Act of 1696, that authorised  colonial Vice-Admiralty courts, and with the creation in 1700 of a General  Post Office that had branches in the colonies. Furthermore, the spread of a  measure of religious toleration (markedly so in contrast with the French and  Spanish empires) led to pressure on colonial assemblies to copy the Toleration  Act of 1689. This toleration also led to the Naturalization Act of 1740,  which offered to foreign Protestants and Jews in the colonies the rights of  British subjects.
 Similarly, there was a religious dimension to the American War of  Independence (1775–83), with Nonconformists more prone to oppose  George III, while Episcopalians were more likely to back him; although there  was no automatic relationship in either case. More generally, the religious  dimension joined empire at home to the situation abroad, with hostility to  Catholicism providing a key element in opposition to France and Spain. Linda  Colley’s perceptive account, in Britons: Forging the Nation 1707–1837 (1992),  of the role of Protestantism in British national identity, by extension covers the  empire. Religious concerns help explain not only the logic of empire but also the  artificiality of treating it separately to domestic and foreign policies. Missionary  activity was a product of this aspect of empire and one that linked congregations  in Britain to an exalted sense of imperial purpose.6
 were particularly tolerant of religious groups outside the Established  Churches, although the position in individual colonies varied: in Virginia,  in 1643, Puritan nonconformity was banned, whereas, six years later, Lord  Baltimore, the Catholic proprietor of Maryland, had the Assembly enact a law  of toleration.
 Imperial Missions Missionary activity was an important aspect of British commitment to the  trans-oceanic world, and most, although not all, of this activity focused on the  empire. The long-established Societies for Promotion of Christian Knowledge  (founded in 1698), and for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts  (1701), were joined by the Baptist Missionary Society (1792), the London  Missionary Society (1795), the Anglican Church Missionary Society (1795),  the Scottish Missionary Society (1799), the Society for Missions to Africa  and the East (1799; from 1812 the Church Missionary Society), and the  Wesleyan Missionary Society (1813). The British and Foreign Bible Society,  established in 1804, spread the word in another way. From the 1860s, female  missionaries became important, while the role of nuns ensured that women were  always highly significant for the Catholic presence.20 The separate missionary  societies indicated the extent to which empire was a sphere for competitive  proselytisation. The Church of England would not even co-operate with the  Scottish Episcopal Church in India in the early nineteenth century. Moreover,  a stress on Protestantism continued the theme of rivalry with Catholicism.  Nevertheless, Catholicism appeared a less present threat after Britain’s victories  in the Napoleonic Wars. The ending of legal disabilities for Nonconformists  and Catholics was highly significant for this partial reconceptualisation of  the religious character of the British empire. The emphasis was on a Christian  presence and ethos, rather than simply a Protestant one.

 exploitation. Eventual independence was defined in terms of the establishment  of a Westminster parliamentary democracy.
 In practice, this approach represented a serious failure to appreciate the  situation in 1706–07. The Union was an English move to extend the Act of  Settlement to Scotland and to end the threat posed by the Scottish parliament’s  capacity for separate legislation, notably the 1705 Act allowing Scotland to  choose a successor to the Scottish Crown. Although the passage of the Act of  Union through the Scottish Parliament in 1706 in part depended on successful  political management as well as corruption, there were also important issues  of self-interest. The Scottish economy was in a very poor state, there was a  determination not to be shut out from English and colonial markets, the  bitter civil war of 1689–91 had underlined the difficulty of independence  from England, and the powerful leadership of the Presbyterian Church, whose  privileged position in a seriously divided Scotland was written into the treaty,  accepted the Union as a political necessity because there was no good Protestant  alternative. The refusal of the exiled Stuarts to convert to Protestantism gravely  lessened Scottish options.

 Ballantyne argues that the development of Aryanism as a racial ideology on the New Zealand frontier in the nineteenth century was the product of a multiplicity of transnational connections between colonial South Asia and the Pacific. Several constellations of imperial networks were par- ticularly crucial, including an emergent imperial newspaper and print culture that connected the colony to the wider world of empire, and the establishment of learned institutions, such as Theosophy and the Poly- nesian Society, which had strong and direct connections to India. But perhaps most important were well-developed migration networks that linked India and New Zealand, including a large cluster of colonial sur- veyors and foresters, who began their careers in the service of the East India Company (and later, the Government of India) before transferring to New Zealand. ‘Thus’, writes Ballantyne, ‘two elite cliques of experi- enced India hands played a pivotal role in state-sponsored colonial science and were at the forefront of the colonial project to map and demarcate land and to police its effective use’.52
 The goal of improvement and its linkage with science formed, then, a part of the mentality of the British elite in the formative period of its empire. Turning such goals into a programmatic strategy for the advance- ment of knowledge within the imperial setting required, however, a com- mitment on the part of the British state which was slow to be realized. Francis Bacon had tried in vain to interest James I in his plans for the reform of learning and many of his successors and their administrations were equally slow in embracing the view that the state should serve as a patron of scientific progress. British government had long been based on the view that the state should limit its functions as much as possible, leaving much of the day to day administration to be carried on at the local level through the voluntary service of a landowning class which accepted the need to act as Justices of the Peace and other such func- tionaries as a just return for their social position. In science, too, vol- untary service was seen as the natural way to proceed – a message underlined by the fact that at its foundation the Royal Society in 1660 received no more than a royal title and a mace from Charles II.
 Elsewhere in the British Empire, too, science formed an important part of the elite culture and its cultivation was both a mark of gentility and an espousal of the goals of improvement which formed an important part of the justification of empire.51 The growth of local scientific societies was one index of the increasing local consolidation of colonial elites. Such local scientific bodies provided an opportunity for rational amuse- ment, social and political networking and, it was hoped, the promotion of the goals of improvement. Accordingly, particular emphasis was placed on the study of possible sources of improved economic well-being – one of the major goals espoused by Jones in his presidential address on the importance of Indian science. When, for example, the Van Diemen’s Land Scientific Society was founded in 1829, it was ‘constituted … in  imitation of the Royal & other literary & scientific societies of Europe & India’, and it took as one of its major goals the ‘eliciting and discovering the properties and uses to which the vegetable productions of the island may be applied and to ascertain the improvements which may be adopted in their cultivation’.52 Its successor body, the grandly named, The Royal Society of Van Diemen’s Land for Botany, Horticulture and the Advance- ment of Body (founded in 1843 as the first Royal Society outside Britain) urged its members to promote ‘the advance of Science and the progress of the Colony’.53
 This is not to argue that ‘science’, or ‘scientists’ did not exist in Aus- tralia before the wave of exhibitions starting in the 1860s and reaching their apex two decades later by the time of the Melbourne Centennial International in 1888. That earlier history provided a foundation for science and scientists at the exhibitions, including an existing public pres- ence and at least some public authority. As noted above, scientific dis- plays alone were popular at the first two metropolitan exhibitions held in Sydney and Melbourne in 1854, primarily as a way to collect Australian exhibits for the Paris Universal Exposition one year later. Such exhibits and the participation of colonial scientists drew upon general scientific interest in the colonies. The practice of science itself was part of settle- ment from the very first British generations in the forms of mapping, mineralogy, botanical gardens, natural history, and other practical exer- cises.42 Scientific enterprise of this kind benefited from the pattern of colonial state intervention in public affairs, a precedent established dur- ing the early years of official colonization in New South Wales and Vic- toria, and consented to by even the most ‘conservative’ pastoralists and politicians.43 Scientific societies pursuing ambitious projects inevitably developed a close relationship with local, or colonial governments, such as those in the city of Melbourne and the colony of Victoria. Since many Australian politicians were active in these philosophical and scientific societies and Colonial Governors served as patrons, it is not surprising that requests for official assistance were often fulfilled, if offers them- selves were not forthcoming.44
 The institutional foundations and networks were clearly present in the young colonies of the Australian continent. Key scientists were active in public institutions, voluntary societies, perhaps even commercial life, their various positions and roles often connected and mutually reinforc- ing. Officers and staff of the major scientific collections were also major players at the exhibitions. In this way, colonial public life mirrored to a great degree English developments. John Stuart Mill noted in 1836 that England ‘is covered with associations’, or ‘societies’, including those  for political, religious, philanthropic, and scientific purposes.45 Notable among such societies were the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the provincial Mechanics’ Institutes. By mid-century, similar associations were found throughout at least eastern Australia, where  agricultural societies and mechanics’ institutes provided the Antipodean reflection of the metropole’s mid Victorian institutional image. As was the case with their British brethren, such associations in Australia offered lectures, journals, museums, libraries, and art and industrial expositions, creating the sinews of nineteenth-century local, civic, colonial and inter- colonial, or national culture, both artistic and scientific.46
 Scientists were anxious about their place in colonial society, seized by a sense of impermanence and disregard, or homelessness in all of its mean- ings. Reverend W.B. Clarke addressed such concerns in his ‘Anniversary Address’ to the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1875 amid the flurry of exhibitions in the Australian colonies, Britain, and Europe.63 Clarke was perhaps the most well-known and active geologist in the colony,  if not throughout Australasia, and his public scientific life included organ- izing exhibits, writing essays, and serving as commissioner for Australian exhibitions starting with the first Sydney Metropolitan show in 1854.
 To those ends, significant and enduring connections with other learned societies in New South Wales, across the borders in the other Australian colonies, and abroad should be pursued. The Royal Society needed to be part of the various networks potentially connecting it and its members to a wider world, both at home in its own colony and beyond the colony’s borders. Science and its public face, the Royal Society, might then become a permanent and well-funded institution, recognized as part of colonial society and generator, recipient, and representative of wider civic and national, if not imperial, interests. Science was seen as a vital connection creating and a vital metaphor representing the nation and society. It pro- vided not only a language comprehensible at home and abroad, but also the social, cultural, and intellectual authority necessary to justify public policies. Might not society and the nation work the way that science and scientists did?

 Counterfactuals are, of course, impossible to prove. One cannot assert, for instance, with any degree of certitude, events that did not in fact occur, nor name that centralizing figure who might have been India’s Bismarck, Mazzini, Atatürk or Garibaldi in the absence of the British. But historical events find their own dramatis personae, and it is unreasonable to suggest that what happened everywhere else would not have happened in India. From such an initially hybrid system could have emerged a modern constitutional monarchy and political institutions built upon the Mughal administrative system, as modified by the Marathas. But these are hypotheticals. The British came, and no such non-colonial India emerged.
 Part of the problem was that the Indian social structures were unfamiliar to the British, whose own villages survived in a largely feudalistic relationship to their landlords. Empire was in many ways the vehicle for the extension of British social structures to the colonies they conquered. The socio-political constructs that the British made in their Empire were primarily reflections of the traditional, individualistic, unequal and still class-ridden society that existed in England. The architects of Empire, responding to what they knew, sought to recreate the rural arcadia of Tory England, where local government since the sixteenth century had been controlled by those with high social prestige and ruled by an established squirearchy. Instead of the autonomous village governments the British dismantled in India, English villages were in the hands of the traditional lords, the grandees being supplemented by gentry attached to them. The English tried to find similar structures in the traditional societies of their colonies, and when they could not, they invented an approximation of them. Thus was born the ‘indirect rule’ system of government that characterized much of the Empire, with power devolved to an entire hierarchy of greater and lesser imitation ‘gentlemen’, many given British-invented titles like ‘Rai Bahadur’ or even knighted (and, in a couple of cases, ennobled) for their pains. This was both less expensive for the Empire and, as with the English system at home, it was run by complicit amateurs, so there was no need to create a professional class of Indians who would wield, and then seek to exercise, political authority.
 Yes, it brought in a supposedly free press, but ensured it operated under severe constraints, and planted the seeds of representative parliamentary institutions while withholding the substance of power from Indians.

 It would be a simple thing to consign both Eden and Hacket’s publication  of Ribaut’s voyage solely to their desire to see England establish an overseas  empire. This is, in fact, the larger object Eden has in mind, as his dedicatory  epistle and letter to the reader make plain, and this is the reading of his work  that has attracted the most scholarly attention.11 Given all this, Eden’s decision  to cite the Spanish example is not surprising. The First Three English Books ap- peared at the time of the marriage of Mary Tudor—a Catholic who had con- troversially reversed the Protestant reforms of Henry VIII and Edward VI— to Philip II of Spain, and the possibilities of emulation and cooperation were  not lost on Eden. Similarly, Hacket operated within the growing world of  Elizabethan publishing that produced many tracts, essays, and books concerned  with colonization and empire.12 Yet there is more happening in these texts than the mere notion of developing a powerful and wealthy national enterprise. De- spite the fierce doctrinal differences between  Protestants—be it members of  the Church of England or dissenters like the Puritans or  Huguenots—and Ro- man Catholics, their worldviews were remarkably similar. The Iberians, in  keeping with a largely medieval, millenarian theological grid, saw the New  World as possessing both Edenic and satanic qualities, while the English and  their French Calvinist religious allies imagined their worlds along similar  lines. As Jorge Cañizares- Esguerra puts it, “British Protestants and Spanish  Catholics deployed similar religious discourses to explain and justify conquest  and colonization.” In the same vein, they also constructed a vision of the New  World landscape within those convergent religious boundaries.13

 According to Gilroy, Britain’s history of colonial expansion and its subju- gation of weaker nations has not only derailed a doctrine of multicultural- ism but has contributed to the success of an American-led ‘unipolar global  order’ (p. 3), which sustains the global structure of imperialism.
 This same Arnoldian-Leavisite tradition infl uences the novels of colo- nial servants and settlers who returned to England from the colonies dur- ing the period of extensive decolonization. Throughout his career, Greene  remained in self-exile from Britain and set his novels from the late-1950s  and early-1960s— Our Man in Havana  (1958) and  A Burnt out Case   (1960)—in Cuba and the Belgian Congo.  23   Burgess, on the other hand,  returned to England and, although he was to leave again in 1968, pro- duced a number of novels that responded to the immediate impact of  decolonization on British culture and society.

David Alderson notes that the CCCS was ‘the fi rst of its  kind, though subsequently there were to be numerous university  centres in related fi elds’ ( 2002 , p. 713). The CCCS was closed in  2002 following a restructuring of departments at Birmingham  University (see Curtis,  2002 ).
 This study argues that the British empire from 1780 to 1830  (and in some areas beyond)' represented not simply a hiatus between  the irresistible waves of liberal reform, but a series of attempts to  establish overseas despotisms which mirrored in many ways the  politics of neo-absolutism and the Holy Alliance of contemporary  Europe. These colonial despotisms were characterised by a form of  aristocratic military government supporting a viceregal autocracy, r  by a well-developed imperial style which emphasised hierarchy  and racial subordination, and by the . patronage of indigenous  landed elites. Of course, constitution-making for the dependencies  remained evolutionary and pragmatic; it rarely aspired to uniform- ity (Madden 1987: xxxiv-v). However, in the British tradition at  least, the formal statements of constitutions or colonial minutes  are a poor guide to real social and political change; there are  distinct limitations to history based on what men tell their lawyers  they are doing. If we consider the ideas which informed political  arrangements, the style and direction of policies and the social  context in which they operated, the argument for continuity  seems inappropriate. The era between American Independence  and the Great Reform Bill does indeed warrant its description  as a 'Second British Empire'. Similarly, the decline of this new  style of imperialism after 1830 had as much to do with indigenous  resistance and international economic crisis as with the triumph of  liberalism at home.
 The imperial dimension of the British state was equally important  in Ireland where between 1780 and 1830 an attempt was made to  modernise and purge the Protestant Ascendancy and assimilate the  Catholic gentry to a Greater Britain. But historical writing has been  straitjacketed by the 'English' and 'nationalist' views of Irish history.  English historiography tends to see Ireland as a 'problem' to be  solved by constitutional artangements such as the Act of Union of  1801. The extent to which Ireland was the colonial society where  the mechanics and ideology ofimperial rule were first implemented,  has often been glossed over. At the same time, nationalist historical  writing unduly neglects the critical role of the Irish within British  imperial expansion and equates nationalism with anti-imperialism.  This is an anachronism. Irish patriots were desperate to reap the  benefits of imperial expansion while Irish soldiers and savants were  in the front line of empire-building. In short, Irish nationalism arose  from Ireland's perceived exclusion from empire, not her inclusion  within it.
 INVERTED PATRIOTISM: THE CASE OF SCOTLAND Wales, the first English colony, had been shackled to London  since the Act of Union of 1536. In the eighteenth century its  thoughtlessly Anglocentric and Protestant elite filtered through  Oxford into London society Uones 1984: 46-50), while English  tradesmen and factors fanned out across the valleys. The incorpo- ration of Scotland and Ireland into this 'British Empire in Europe'  proceeded along similar paths. However, it was much more violent  and contentious, driven by fear of revolt from below as much as by  the desire for profit and status. The timing was also different. The  Scottish elite had already thrown in its lot with London in 1707; the  revolts of 1715 and 1745 confirmed their assimilation. The Irish  Protestants were to haver until the end of the century when they  were blown into legislative Union with Great Britain by Catholic  peasant revolt. Thus the consolidation of an imperial state both  inside and outside Europe depended on these three conditions: the  distribution of benefits from economic integration; the intensity of  revolt 'from below'; and the imminence of an external threat.
 Parochial economic and social conflicts arising from rapid  growth and a change in the nature of the economy during  the great upswing after 1730 provided one set of conditions for  relations between the Irish ruling class and the British empire.  Another dimension, however, was added by the constitutional and  political relations between the Irish elite and London. Up to 1790,  and most particularly during the period of 1782-4 when the Irish  volunteer movement was at its height, this establishment seemed  set to follow a path similar to that of the American colonists.  British control over the Irish Parliament (enshrined in Poyning's  Law of 1494) was deeply resented, particularly since Ireland was  restricted from full participation in the British colonial system,  while still being expected to pay for imperial defence through excise and other taxes. On this the Protestant gentry and the  Catholic middle class (itself disadvantaged by exclusion from  office under anti-Catholic disabilities) were at one. The crisis of the  American War of Independence allowed the Irish elite to demand  from Britain parliamentary independence and various concessions  in trade .
 This Irish political community showed some signs of cultural  assimilation before 1790. Agrarianist philosophy and a desire for  the 'improvement' of the Catholic peasantry brought Anglican,  Presbyterian and crypto-Catholic together in the vigorous literary  and debating world of Dublin . In the 1760s and 1770s some  Catholic gentry took to the practice of occasional conformity with  Anglicanism to gain access to public office (MacDonagh 1984: 23).  In local government, again, some Catholic gentry were admitted  to shares of patronage , while both Protestant and Catholic sought  service in the army of the East India Company, one division of  the imperial forces where religious affiliation was regarded with  indifference . All the same, the assimilation of the Catholic middle  class, it soon proved , was too little and too late . Only 10 per cent of  the subscriptions to the Bank of Ireland stock in the 1780s was in  Catholic hands; some decades after it was made legal for Catholics  to own land, there were remarkably few large Catholic estates (Lord  Sheffield 1785: 373) .
 The imperial principle also won out with ease in Wales. During the  1780s the Principality had spawned many radical cells, led by men  such as the dissenting minister, Richard Price. They drew on the  poverty of rural Wales and resentment at the economic and political  dominance of the small group of Anglo-Welsh gentry; they also saw  Welsh neglect by Parliament as part of a much wider, imperial  problem. The outbreak of the French wars, however, signalled a  rapid decline of old Welsh radicalism. Methodism had been the  most vigorously expanding faith in Wales in the later eighteenth  century. The Methodist leadership, now under suspicion of '.jacobin'  tendencies, rallied smartly to the state, becoming 'plus royaliste que  le roi'. John Elias taught his followers that it was their duty to  submit to authority, while Charles of Bala wrote his Welsh Methodists  Vindicated to celebrate their loyalty (Davies and Edwards 1939: 165).  Like the Scottish tradition, the Welsh language and literature had  already become a scholarly bauble for English writers and poets,  and its moral centre was probably Oxford not Aberystwyth Oones  1984: 46--9). Hereafter, Welsh dissent and nationalism became the  preserve of small groups of radicals in the new manufacturing  towns, Welsh emigres to North America and isolated romantic  bards.
 The Crown had evidently to play an important role, especially  in the empire. The wider Burkean formulation of the 'glories  of the British constitution' was inappropriate where indigenous  peoples were to be denied their own 'constitutions', and besides,  Burke's conservatism had displayed a strong anti-imperialist face,  at least as regards the East India Company. The established Church  might also be an important resource for state- and empire-building  but, again, there were problems. The accommodation of Protestant  Dissenters and Catholics raised difficult issues in Europe, while  direct evangelisation of Asians and Africans was suspect because  it might create 'mongrel' Christian races whose loyalty to the  Crown would be in doubt. During the generation after 1790  an uneasy compromise was evolved. On the one hand, the  Anglican Church was projected more forcefully outside England,  but mainly among people of British descent and their dependents,  or among people who were already Christian. For non-Christians,  the role of the Church was to be a glorious, but distant exemplar of national piety . On the other hand, the establishment delicately  encouraged the 'nationalisation' of Methodism and the Dissenting  Churches, whose prominent members already sought respectability  and distance from the earlier stigma of radicalism.
 The Protestant empire was also reinforced by the 'governing race'  principle which emphasised the fitness of Britons to rule by virtue  of their 'moral independency' and their understanding of the rule  of law; an institutionalised and philosophical racism thus became  an increasingly important part of the project . What has been called  here 'agrarian patriotism' was an outward manifestation of the right  to rule, and one which provided a serviceable unifying theory which  threatened fewer vested interests than the encouragement of free  trade. The divisions and contradictions with the plural British state  could also be submerged in the very acts of war and empire-building  themselves. Empire thus became a necessary component of British  nationalism in a way that it had never been central to English  patriotism.
 llO Nationalist display and viceregal ritual also became more  common in the colonies. After 1800, many new 'Crowy-colonies'  were created. Conquered territories such as Java or,,-Ceylon were  not annexed to the East India Company where the British Crown  had an ambiguous status. In possessions both old and new, public  ritual was designed to elevate the role of the governor and the Crown  over the still recalcitrant creole elites. For this a serviceable model  existed in the pageantry of the Viceregal Lodge in Dublin with its  formal levees and investitures of the Order of St Patrick. These  Irish ceremonies gave dignity to the annual ladling out of honours  and had been invented by administrations in the 1760s and 1770s  fighting to get their measures through the Irish Parliament.
 Once again, Ireland provided an interesting model. The fears  and hatreds engendered by the Catholic and peasant revolts which  flared up between 1796 and 1798 culminated in the emergence  of Protestant Orange movements with their aggressive martial  displays. In contrast to this, the viceroyalty seemed a relatively  benevolent force to many Catholics. In 1798 Earl Fitzmaurice  as lieutenant-governor pressed, but failed to win, the case for  their full emancipation and enfranchisement. In the 1820s Lord  Wellesley, who himself married a Catholic, voiced public hostility  to extreme Protestant claims and urged full Catholic assimilation  into political life (Brynn 1978: 84). Viceregal ritual, especially the  St Patrick's Day celebrations, achieved a degree of popular Catholic  support in Dublin during the years of the nineteenth century. The  new patriotism quickly enshrined its heroes, so that by the end of  the war, Nelson and Wellington, both the subject of fierce early  criticism, stood beside the royal pedestal, along with other minor  luminaries such as Rodney, and Wellesley who had built up a  coterie among Anglo-Indians even while some in Parliament were  still trying to prosecute him for war-mongering.
 Alongside the closer definition of both the nation and its foes  went the call to discipline and respectability. One powerful source of  this opinion was the growth of evangelical attitudes among Anglican  churchmen and the gentry which will be discussed below. Yet the  closer association of patriotism and right conduct deserves attention  here. The king, the nobility and leading members of the hierarchy  such as Beilby Porteus, Bishop of London, associated degeneracy  and immorality with political radicalism and regicide. During the  1790s a great variety of movements for the reform of public morals,  the suppression of drunkenness and the preservation of the Sabbath  emerged in the capital, sponsored and often supported by ministers.  Painfully slowly, attempts to reform the older universities which  had begun to occur in the 1770s and 1780s now gathered pace.  Tutors began to push for a university-wide examination system  in Cambridge and in 1801 the first Senate House Examinations  were held. This, they hoped, would impose patriotic discipline  on a student body which was felt to be restive and dissatisfied.  Several of the Heads of Colleges who instituted this move had  close contacts with Pitt's ministry. One wrote that his aim was to  reinforce the prestige of Church and university and to teach the  young to 'resist and refute the metaphysical subtleties which have thrown half of the , nations of Europe into confusion' (Rothblatt  1974: 286).
 In other parts of the empire, the active role of the state was,  however, much more in evidence. In Ireland the ruling class was  too scattered and culturally remote from the populace especially  in the south, for anything like the English JP system to work. The  electorate was kept small by anti-Catholic laws and the poverty of  the population so that local bodies were inadequate to share in  the tasks of regulation and taxation discharged by their English  equivalents. The state had to take a more direct role, and one  which, in theory, stood above the interests of the great Protestant  landowning families, the brewers, maltsters and linen-masters. The  shock delivered to the Anglo-Irish ruling elite in the 1780s, there- fore, engendered a movement towards reform or, more precisely,  towards state regulation. Administrative 'reform', moreover, was a  more acceptable response to crisis than any dallying with political  reform which might have threatened the Protestant Ascendancy .  The career of Sir J. Fitzpatrick (MacDonagh 1984) was born out  of this new spirit. His public services began with the control and  regulation of Irish charter schools (1785-7) and the scandalous  Irish prison service (the Irish Prisons Amendment Act, 1787).  Later, Fitzpatrick's concern for Irish soldiers serving in the imperial  army embroiled him in a campaign for the reform of conditions of  service for soldiers in England, and eventually drew his attention to  the regulation of convict ships sailing from Portsmouth. While little  change occurred in the fragmented army bureaucracy, Fitzpatrick's  initiatives did coincide with a more general movement towards  regulation. The need for this was impressed on the ministry after  the usual failures at the beginning of the Revolutionary Wars. The  Transport Board was created by order-in-council in 1794. The Alien  Office, designed to control refugees and 'seditionists', took shape in  1793-4, while a national system of royal mails began to operate in  1792.
 The imperial dimension of this should be stressed. Fitzpatrick achieved his entree into English administration through the good  offices of Lord Moira, one of the strongest advocates of patriotic  union between Britain and Ireland (MacDonagh 1984: 154-5).  Several other specialists, most notably the young Castlereagh  (prime minister, 1808-18), also had their first taste ofinterventionist  administration while serving Dublin Castle in the reforming 1780s  and the troubled 1790s. Later the Moira connection was to prove  one of the most important channels of administrative talent to India  and the Cape of Good Hope. Fitzpatrick himself had sonie dealings  with the East India Company when he attempted to set in motion  moves for the regulation of their large and badly maintained fleet  in 1796 (ibid.: 242).
 Over and above the accountable district official, who inherited  an awesome sense of natural fitness to govern from gentry  exemplars of the past, stood the 'Board', a body of semi-specialist  administrators and political appointees. The last few years of the  century saw a proliferation of the numbers and function of  such administrative boards both in Britain and the colonies.  In India the great increas~ of official business connected with  the reorganisation of Indian land revenue after I 793 expanded  the role of executive overseeing bodies such as the Boards of  Revenue which stood between collectors and distant or preoccupied  governors. These inquisitorial and supervisory bodies were meant to guard the new autocratic district officials from peculation and  old perquisites which were coming to be seen as corrupt. They  were firmly subordinated to the now more powerful governors. In  Britain, such new concentrations of specialist expertise had greater  executive power. Thus the Colonial Office itself developed quite  rapidly out of the Board of War and Colonies under the influence ,  of Lord Bathurst and a number of taxation and colonial experts  such as William Huskisson whose careers ran parallel to those of  their peers at the newly professionalised Treasury (Madden 1987:  26-30).
 In Ireland the Anglican clergy were not in such a good position  to act as the eyes and the ears of the new state; they had too much  on hand getting in their tithes and preventing their hayricks being  burnt out. All the same, agrarianism was seen as the natural policy  for imperial consolidation. An Essay on the Present State of Manners  and Education among the Lower Class of the People of Ireland and of the  Means of Improving Them ( 1799) urged that an Agricultural Board  should take a leading role in both the improvement of Irish  agriculture and educating peasant children in 'active industry', as 'religious bigotry' derived from ignorance and idleness. Moreover,  the government should try to 'engage the cooperation of catholic  ministers' in providing information and leadership on the model  of the Scottish clergy who had 'zealously' helped Sir John Sinclair.  The notion of associating Catholic priests with an imperial project  would appear bizarre even a generation later .
 THE IMPERIAL ELITE AND GENTRY RESURGENCE Politicians were now unusually well connected among the secular  and ecclesiastical intelligentsia. The influence of Adam Smith was  extended through the medium of improvers such as Sinclair and  Arthur Young. Wilberforce, Hannah Moore, Grant, Shore and  other Evangelicals were close to Pitt himself. This relationship  bloomed during the campaign against the slave trade and it extend- ed to other issues including Irish and colonial government. Pitt was  also connected with Anglican moral reformers in the hierarchy,  notably Beilby Porteus, Bishop of London, and with reforming  heads of Oxford and Cambridge colleges. Dundas's coterie, which  included Scots intellectuals and imperial administrators such as Wellesley and Macartney, ramified into the early Colonial Office  under Bathurst. The collective mentality of this governing circle  was Anglican and anti-Jacobin. It was fired with a sharper sense of  British national and imperial mission. It represented a conservative  philosophical cabal, as influential as that of Milner, Curzon and  Baring a century later, during another period of 'new imperialism'.  In the earlier eighteenth century only the Elder Pitt's war ministry  had been anything like this, and even then had lacked its cohesion  and long-term influence.
 THE CHURCH MILITANT, RACE AND LAW The last chapter considered the changes in institutions within  the British elite which gave form to the Second British Empire.  Even if there was no 'Regency Revolution in Government' there  was a considerable extension of the role of the state and its arms  of coercion, and this was particularly true of the peripheries of the  'British Empire in ~urope'. However, there was a much sharper  discontinuity between the 'first' and 'second' empires in the realm of  ideas and attitudes. Racial superiority was now more firmly inscribed  in institutions. This was a change which predated by some years the  full impact of evangelical and utilitarian ideas in the 1820s and  1830s, or of the Indian Mutiny of 1857, which many historians  have seen as turning points in the emergence of British racism.  Two other elements were also important. First, there was a growth of evangelical ideas within the established churches (Anglican, Church  of Ireland and Scottish Presbyterian). Secondly, agrarian patriots  who had once been hostile to empire took their message abroad.  The dominant ideological character of this Second British Empire  was aristocratic, autocratic and agrarianist. By contrast, free trade  and early 'liberal' ideas were much more characteristic of what might  be called the 'Third' Empire which emerged in 1830s and after.
 These currents of ideas did not, of course, sweep all before  them. Nor were actors on the political stage uniformly affected  by them. Many evangelicals were suspicious of colonial conquest;  a few even felt that the institution of slavery could be made  morally acceptable. On the other hand, there were imperial  proconsuls such as Mountstuart Elphinstone who remained pure  eighteenth-century deists; or royalists like Thomas Maitland who  were sceptics and 'pagans' . Rather, what happened was that public  discourse was powerfully influenced by the more strident rhetoric  of well-organised proponents of the new 'moral majoritarianism'  (Hilton 1988). Again, the prescriptions of evangelical thinkers  for Britain and for her dependencies might differ considerably.  People whose commitment to an individualistic moral rearmament  in English society was closely connected with their advocacy of free  trade and a distrust of paternalism, could be found arguing that  in the colonies, or even in Ireland, 'the state of society' warranted  benevolent British intervention in the market and indigenous  customs. Thus divisions between 'liberal Tories' and 'high Tories',  between dissenting evangelicals and conservative Anglicans, which  bulked large in England, often dissolved in the colonial context. To  this extent, colonial projects helped reinforce a national consensus  at home.
 There was a myth propagated by liberal historians of empire  that religion played only a small role in the British imperialism  which was a pragmatic construction of hardy entrepreneurs and  agnostic statesmen. By contrast, religious zeal was characterisitic  of the Iberians and French overseas. Though direct missionary  activity or forced conversion was rare indeed among the British, the  spirit of the revived empire of the Napoleonic Wars was throughly  infused with a kind of Anglican providentialism which acted more  or less subtly on policy. This helps to explain that though Crown  and Company preached religious neutrality, indigenous people,  non-Protestants and non-Anglicans almost everywhere feared  religious assimilation. Their reactions ranged from Catholic  nationalism in Ireland through Calvinist separatism in southern Africa to the fear of 'frankish' or unclean influences which inspired  the Vellore Mutiny of the Madras army in 1806.
 The view that British overseas dominion was the creation  of an Anglican Providence had often been voiced before, even  in the Bengal of the 1770s when the secular values of the  Enlightenment seemed dominant . The classical fear that empire  necessarily corrupted civic virtue through luxury and decadence  was already on the wane by the 1770s (Marshall 1981). Following  the growth of Methodism and the trauma of the French Revolution,  the link between evangelical Protestantism, nationalism and empire  was forged more strongly. There was a change of philosophical  perspective. Some Old Dissenters and Rational Dissenters (such as  Unitarians) had drifted from allegiance to the British Crown during  the American War and had denounced patriotism. Anglican radicals  such as Wyvill had preached the cause of the Americans and reform.
 After 1790, Unitarianism rapidly declined. Anglicans, Baptists  and Presbyterians all vigorously attacked 'unpatriotic' dissenters  such as Richard Price. Whereas the religious form of philosophic  individualism had tended to downgrade 'the affections', including  affection towards nation, the younger generation drew upon the  philosopher Hartley who argued that 'the constitution of the  human mind requires family affections and patriotism as necessary  preconditions of general benevolence'. Writers such as Wilberforce  or full-blooded Anglicans such as Burke and Coleridge seemed to  suggest that religion was integrally patriotic. For Coleridge, indeed,  national and social discipline seemed more important for the reli- gious life than individual struggle, and 'national unity is secured by  the Church'. The importance of private, philosophical judgement  was never completely rejected, but moral seriousness, godliness and  patriotism seemed ever more closely aligned (Stafford 1982: 385).
 This was largely a reaction to the growth of Methodism, which  was only later intensified by fear of French Jacobinism . For many  among the gentry and wealthier merchant class, Methodism was a  'state within a state', It was a sect which propagated itself by the  manipulation of family ties of affection, and one which might  undermine both the established Church and the Constitution.  This was because loyalty to country was essentially an extension  of affection to family. From this perspective, Wesley had become  almost a 'Romish Saint', while Methodists were now 'a distinct people  in the Empire, having their peculiar laws and manners, a hierarchy,  a costume, even a physiognomy of their own' (QR: 4, 1810, 480). So  a new Anglican patriotism had to be called into being because the legitimacy of the Church and the definition of nation as a religious  community was being contested in England for the first time since  the end of the Catholic challenge of the Pretenders in 1745.
 When the Methodists formally seceded from the Church  of England ( 1795) and spawned yet more advanced religious  opinions, concern about them grew. Their success in attracting  lower middle-class and labouring people, particularly in regions  distant from London, was also a source of suspicion for a ruling  class increasingly worried about popular unrest. The Methodists'  outwardly conservative political stance did not fully allay such fears.  Yet the first reaction from within the ruling class, the evangelical  movement, was almost as suspect as the Methodists in the eyes of  many Anglicans. Of course, Wilberforce's attempts to establish a  public godliness and sobriety, trumpeted in his A practical view of the  prevailing religious system of professed Christians in the higher and middle  cwsses of the country contrasted with real Christianity ( 1798), ran parallel  to the emerging orthodox Anglican movement which associated  ungodly living with political radicalism. Like them, Wilberforce  stressed the 'corruption of human nature' as contrasted with the  Enlightenment philosophers, and he bewailed the spread of vice  especially among the middle classes of the cities (Wilberforce 1798:  385). Like them, he also lauded 'the tendency of religion, and  especially of Christianity to promote the well-being of political  communities' (ibid.: 35). The problem was that the attitude of  Wilberforce and the Anglican evangelicals to the Church hierarchy  was ambiguous. Some Anglicans saw among them a dangerous sect,  another implicit challenge to the authority of priest and bishop.  What was needed, therefore, was a militant revival within the  Anglican communion, but one directed by bishops who were to be  the leading edge of an imperial moral rearmament. For this type  of Anglican, reform of the lower classes and the moral salvation of  the colonies were closely equated. They represented a break with  the eighteenth-century tradition of decentralised lay Anglicanism  which had seen the wider empire as little more than a bin-end of  ecclesiastical patronage.
 A key figure in the revitalisation movement within the Anglican  establishment was Beilby Porteus, a native of New England, who  was Bishop of London from 1786 to 1811. Porteus's support for the  relief of the political disabilities of Dissenters and Roman Catholics  brought him near to the position of Pitt, Wellesley and Dundas, who  favoured a policy of imperial 'assimilation'. Not all Methodists or  Anglican evangelicals were as tolerant of Catholicism. Porteus and his acolytes also favoured a moral revival within English society.  He opposed Sunday political debating societies which sprang up  in the 1780s and was struck by 'the increasing profligacy of the  times' (Hodgson 1821: i, 92). He was also active in the 'Society  for Enforcing the King's Proclamation against Immorality and  Profaneness'. Later some of his friends helped promote the  movement for a national educational system espousing Anglican  values (the National Society for Promoting the Education of the  Poor in the Principles of the Anglican Church).
 The emphasis in all these bodies was less on individual  redemption than on social control. London must be the crucible  of change because this was where the 'emissaries of infidelity were  most actively occupied in their work of mischief. Moral change  would come about not through sects and holy cabals but through  the reorganisation and centralisation of the Church itself. Porteus  attempted to establish a code for the Church in his Charge to the  Clergy (1794). He also tried to regain control over the appointment  of East India Company chaplains because of 'the importance of  religion in our eastern settlements' (Hodgson 1821: i, 146-7). As  a man of colonial origins himself, he worked hard in the cause  of the abolition of the slave trade and the cautious evangelisation  of the West Indian slaves. The method was to be one of godly  demonstration by a revived Anglican hierarchy in the Caribbean  over which the Bishop of London was to have much greater  influence. The Church, which had so far confined itself to  benevolent inactivity and distant encouragement of Moravian  and other continental Protestant missionaries, was now to be more  active. The civilisation and conver.sion of the 'negroes in the British  West Indian Islands' should begin with the Church's own trust  estates. Enlightened planters instructed by the king through the  Colonial Office would then initiate a scheme for the promotion of  Christianity among their own slaves. The newly-founded Anglican  Church Missionary Society would work cautiously and slowly in the  areas of British influence.
 The tone of Porteus's activities was typical of the establishment  version of the new Church militant. Like more radical Anglican  evangelicals of the Wilberforce connection and the luminaries  of the dissenting London Missionary Societies (founded 1795),  Porteus believed that the 'providential' destiny of the British  nation had been amply proved by the events of the French Wars.  As his intellectual successor, Claudius Buchanan, Chaplain to the  East India Company, put it, 'Great Britain unquestionably holds the place now which Rome formerly held, in regard to the power  and means of promoting Christian knowledge.' Why else indeed  should providence have saved Great Britain from the 'general wreck  of nations'? (Buchanan 1813: 11) Yet zeal was restrained by prudence. The great aim was to  strengthen the Christian witness of British citizens, particularly  those abroad, along with slaves and servants directly in their charge.  A secondary aim was to convert to Protestantism, Catholics, Syrian  and eastern Orthodox Christians or any of those who could be held  to have already been exposed to God's Word but in a perverted form.  The direct evangelisation of free, heathen peoples was another  matter. Many establishment evangelicals believed that education  and enlightenment must precede evangelisation and that Christian  demonstrations of godliness were more appropriate than the direct  assaults on the souls and affections of heathens approved by more  radical evangelicals. Buchanan's Colonial Ecclesiastical Establishments  summed up these views. The aim was to 'extend the national  Church'. There should be 'bishops in each of Great Britain's  principal provinces'; the universities should become active in  language and translation, and Anglican literary establishments  should be founded in all of the main sectors of the globe.  The location of these missions is of interest. The reclamation  of the planters and their charges in the West Indies was of  prime concern. A slow spread of evangelical thought had begun  among Anglicans connected with the West Indies following James  Ramsey's 'An Essay on the Treatment of African Slaves in the British  Sugar Islands' ( 1786). This argued that Christianity could prevent  'insurrections and murders' and undermine the bases of African  superstitions among the slaves. Buchanan added that 'Mulattos'  were to be saved 'because of their English descent'. The Anglican  establishment was slow to promote societies for more widespread  conversion, but the pressure of abolitionist opinion and periodic  slave revolts had begun to force movement by the early 1820s. In  Africa, Christian witness should be continued among the inhabitants  of Sierra Leone. This colony had been founded for trade . It was  also designed to evangelise the Dark Continent and remove from  the streets of London the thousands of 'negro beggars' who had  been released into them by Lord Mansfield's judgement of 1776,  freeing slaves in England. Commerce, religion and domestic social  control marched hand in hand.
 In Europe and the East, particular attention was to be paid to  Malta and the eastern Mediterranean because here the decay of the Romish Church was very clear; also to the ancient Christian  Churches and to the Jews ( often a target of Christian interest during  periods of providentialist revivalism). In India, Anglo-Indians and  the servants of East India Company officials were ripe for proper  conversion; but so also were the oriental English themselves, only  recently turning away from the dangers of 'brahminisation'.  Buchanan argued that it was particularly important to cement the  bonds with the Anglo-Indian, since if the United States had been  Anglican it would not have revolted against the Crown (Buchanan  1813: 112). Thus Buchanan's ecclesiastical establishments were to  be the frontier posts of a Christian empire.
 For this reason, early Anglican efforts in the East concentrated  on work among existing Christian communities and nominal Chris- tians. In southern and south-western India, attempts were macie to  reconvert Catholic Indian Christians perverted and 'led astray' not  only by Popery but also Hindu superstition. This culminated in the  efforts of John Munro, Resident and later .financial officer of the  Kingdom of Travancore, to seduce the ancient community of St  Thomas Christians from their Monophysite or 'Jacobite' allegiance  into the Anglican fold, a project which involved the Resident's personal intervention in Church matters (Bayly: forthcoming).  These efforts went alongside those of the more radical evangelicals  such as Charles Grant of the India Board of Control who influenced  the Company to send out godly chaplains, encouraged the building  of churches and tried to set a new pious standard of behaviour for  the once wild Company servants. In Ceylon meanwhile, nominal  Christians (those who had been 'converted' by the Dutch Company  in order to qualify for public office) were all provided with copies of  the works of Bishop Porteus with the blessing of the first governors  of the new Crown colony (Hodgson 1821: i, 281).
 Much has been written on the influences of Wilberforce and  the more advanced Anglican evangelicals or of Dissenters on the  moral and educational history of the British empire in the early  nineteenth century. What we have called here the establishment  evangelicals have emerged less clearly. Yet their influence on  the future tone of British imperialism was quite critical. They  had helped convert Anglicanism from the lay conformity of  mid-century into a national and imperial faith, but one which  was directed particularly to British nationals and their immediate  legal descendants by birth (people of mixed race) or by law (slaves).  Empire and national church were henceforth closely connected but  in a much more ambiguous way than was the case with the French  Catholic churches or the Portuguese Padroado (Crown patronage).
 Despite differences over 'colonisation' and the merits of direct  or indirect evangelisation of indigenous peoples, the patriotic and  nationalist tone of missionary work outside the fold of the establish- ment Anglicans was just as striking. In one sense, indeed, the dissent- ing churches, the Church of Scotland and the non-episcopalian  evangelicals became 'nationalised' through their activities in the  colonial mission field, dispelling the stigma of radicalism which  had arisen from their work among the lower classes in Britain. The  efforts of Wilberforce, Grant and their circle significantly increased  public pressure for intervention by Westminster against the colonial  assemblies of the West Indian islands which persistently sought to  frustrate attempts to evangelise the slaves on the ground that this  would increase rather than diminish the danger of slave revolts.  Unrelenting public scrutiny of efforts to suppress the slave trade  in West Africa and to monitor the treatment of slaves in the Cape  Colony set the agenda for Lord Bathurst's expanding bureaucracy  in the Colonial Office. At the same time, Methodist missions to the  South Seas appear to have borrowed their organisational skills from  the Royal Navy and the East India Company (QR: 3, 1809, 25).  Subscriptions were channelled into central holding organisation,  and the importance of settling the Polynesians to 'useful trades'  was emphasised, missionary ships set sail, amidst psalm singing,  under a missionary flag showing 'three doves argent in a purple  field bearing olive branches in their bills'. Methodists and radical  Anglicans also took their 'protestant' crusade to Ireland in the early  years of the nineteenth century. They abandoned an earlier  circumspection and directly attacked the 'Romish superstition' on  the grounds that it held the Irish peasant in thrall and encouraged  popular disaffection against the Crown (Bowen 1971).
 The connection between cultural assimilation within the United  Kingdom and evangelism as an imperial project is equally clear in  Scotland. Scottish Protestants had been sending missions to Gaelic  Catholics since the beginning of the eighteenth century . Towards its  end the influence of English Methodists and evangelicals prompted  a new wave of activity. Great Scottish ladies such as Lady Maxwell,  Lady Glenarchy and the Countess of Leven promoted Sunday Schools and the Edinburgh Tract Society in the 1770s and  1780s (Mathieson 1916: 51 ). Later, John Alexander Haldane,  captain in the East India Company's marine, joined Simeon, a  Cambridge divine, and toured through Fife and the Highlands  in 1796 distributing tracts; in the following year they visited the  west of Scotland founding Sunday Schools. After 1797 the effort  gathered momentum with the distribution of 27,000 tracts in the  Orkneys (ibid.: 63-4).
 Several prominent people in these movements had east or west  India connections, although at this time the dominant Moderates of  the Church of Scotland had little time for Asian missions. William  Carey, a Baptist and one of Bengal's most important missionaries,  was denied help in 1797 (he began work instead in 1800 under the  aegis of Danish missionaries in Serampore, Bengal). However, an  interesting indication of the growing national and imperial consen- sus was the later rapprochement between the once-radical Bengal  missionaries and the Wellesley circle. In 1799 Carey had dropped  the 'teachings of the French' for 'things of greater consequence'  (Potts 1967: 171 ). This paved the way for Carey and his comperes  to become involved with language teaching at Wellesley's new  Fort William College. Meanwhile, the ideology of the Church  of Scotland was itself changing. Many moderate churchmen had  argued in an enlightenment philosophical tradition that secular  learning and 'civilisation' must precede conversion. After 1815,  however, the growth of pietism and the conviction of Britain's  providential mission broke the dam (Mathieson 1916: 272). The  French Revolution had eroded faith in Natural Philosophy, and  Scottish churchmen like their English counterparts began to  emphasise Faith. Nor did they wish to lose out in the explosion  of evangelical activity (Hetherington 1843: 227-8). A great tide of  missionary experience and zeal was unleashed in the East, notably  in Dr Duffs Indian mission. It was now urged that the Hindu soul  could make a quantum leap to Grace through an intuitive grasp of  the meaning of the Gospel. Church of Scotland missionaries were  equally important on the Cape of Good Hope. Their leaning towards  Calvinism made it easier for them to adjust to the inheritance of the  Dutch Reformed Church. Yet their settlements among runaway  slaves and Hottentots played an important part in constructing a  network of specifically British mission stations outside the control of  the Cape Dutch farmers, and at times that of the colonial authorities  themselves.
 Protestant missionary activity, then, was an important aspect of the creation of a British nationalism. Attempts at cultural and  religious assimilation were intended not only to hold out salvation  but also to create a pious and united Protestant empire through  the distribution of tracts or the founding of schools. The stimulus  to these changes in Europe and outside was in large measure fear  of rapid social change. Lower-class sedition, the 'rise and progress  of popular disaffection', inspired attempts to reform the morals of  the London populace, just as Anglican schools in rural Ireland and  Presbyterian Bible centres in the Highlands were an answer to  the problem of the Celtic Catholic peasantry. Even in overseas  settlements, evangelising and the strengthening of the forces  of law and order were often directed not so much towards  indigenous peoples as towards disciplining the European and  Eurasian or Eurafrican underclasses which were developing in the  major imperial centres. The inhabitants of Madras, for instance, had  decided to found a Protestant Orphanage to reclaim the illegitimate  children of European military 'who are thought to number many  thousands' well before large-scale missionary activity got under way  in the Company's territories. The colonial establishment feared  that such people might otherwise become agents of sedition for  the European Catholic or Indian powers. Similar movements were  afoot before the tum of the century in British Cape Town and the  Caribbean islands.
 During these years the state also developed important new tools  for control and intervention in England, but more particularly in  Scotland, Ireland and the colonies. A revivified army, a political  and financial bureaucracy and a series of boards of control. The  state knew more and acted more, whether it was preparing statistics  of occupation in Scotland, revenue in India or slave-holding in the  new World. The disasters of the American War had produced an  interlocking network of parliamentary committees with their own  experts; so administrations also had to know more and be better  prepared.
 The important point here is that popular movements which  arose during the climax of the revolutionary period did not  simply respond to the promptings of elite initiatives; they also limited and formed those policies. The doctrine of political  assimilation of Catholic gentry and merchants advocated by  many of Pitt's followers, and later by Wellesley during his period  as lieutenant-governor, foundered not only because the Crown  and factions in England impeded emancipation, but also because  a broader-based but as yet unorganised peasant nationalism began  to emerge. The Catholic hierarchy itself was drawn willy-nilly into  re-emphasising Catholic pietism and open political activity before  the second decade of the nineteenth century.
 THE PROCONSULAR REGIMES The colonial regimes of the early nineteenth century were broadly  compatible with this society. Rather than being a despotic appendage  to a liberal, free-trading industrial state waiting breathlessly for  domestic and colonial reform, they mirrored and reinforced it in  important respects. Despite the emergence of a more intrusive and  centralising Colonial Office (and the growth of the role of the home  secretary in Irish policy) this empire was only loosely controlled from  the centre. The new Colonial Office, for all its incipient Benthamite  principles, was politically weak, understaffed and obsessed with the  problem of slavery or, more precisely, with the question of how  to make more acceptable at home one particular legal form of  unfreedom in the colonies. Colonial governors and their deputies  had a very free rein on most other issues. Up to 1815 or even  1825, they could cite exigencies of war as an excuse for a personal  and often despotic style of rule. War against the French or against  indigenous opponents of British expansion, Maratha, Burmese,  Sinhalese, Malay or Xhosa, could justify much. The prevailing ethos  of loyalism, royalism and aristocratic military virtue provided them  with charisma, dash and a ready supply of gentlemen, often younger sons of landowners, prepared to operate as their clients in return for  substantial salaries. Fear and loathing of republicanism and disdain  for the non-white, non-Anglo-Saxon, or non-Protestant, reinforced  by the fashionable aristocratic evangelicalism, helped inform their  mentality.
 Although these revivified colonial regimes rooted themselves  in starkly differing societies, they had common features and  comparable results. In general the new viceroys abolished or  eroded the powers of existing representative institutions and tried  to create an official class separated from the lures of commerce or  entanglement with 'native' life. The new official class benefited,  however, from massive salaries and sometimes from patronage in  Crown lands. The existing loose racial hierarchies were purged of  direct and irresponsible violence against slaves (wherever possible),  but defined more subtly through law; indigenous peoples (even  white non-Protestants) were excluded from office. Indigenous and  settler landlords were rewarded as far as possible through the  creation of untrammelled property rights to the detriment of  common rights and shifting tenures, but large concentrations of power were avoided when these were not in the hands of officials.  A 'yeoman' solution was particularly favoured where the Scottish  school of 'moral independency' held sway. Some moves to free  trade were put in train, but monopolies were often maintained  on pragmatic grounds and forms of coercion of labour apart  from abject slavery were vigorously employed. Finally, a subtle  anglicisation and, where possible, anglicanisation was in the air.  Direct proselytisation by missionaries (especially those of lower  class) was frowned upon, .but the English gentlemen and Scottish  public servants tried to inoculate these societies with Church and  the supremacy of law.
 IRELAND AND THE MEDITERRANEAN Naturally, it was in Ireland that the viceregal style of government  came under greatest pressure from the tendency to centralise in  Westminster. Yet the lieutenant-governor, or viceroy, under the  Crown still retained considerable powers. Until 1815 he held the  position of commander-in-chief, and with the growth of British  military and para-military forces in the country between 1816  and 1825, lieutenant-governors were often able to influence the  day-to-day deployment of the coercive power of the state. Until  the 1830s the Irish chief-secretary in London also helped to shield  the lieutenant-governor from interference by the British home  secretary. Several of these still-independent viceroys of the early  nineteenth century attempted to use their authority to cut back  the pretensions of the magnates of the Protestant Ascendancy and  to coax the Catholic gentry and merchant classes into the imperial  project. Wellesley-Pole openly espoused the cause of Catholic  emancipation after 1812; his brother Richard Wellesley married  a Catholic and tried to extend his patronage powers in order to  honour Catholics and exclude extremist Protestant Orangemen  from office (Brynn 1978: 51, 84) . . Trinity College Dublin was  quietly encouraged in its role as an 'imperial academy' and the  officially sponsored St Patrick's Day celebrations and rituals of  the Order of St Patrick were a conscious attempt to nurture a  conservative Irish patriotism within the empire similar to that  which was already paying dividends in Scotland and Wales (Hill  1984).
 Several early governors and senior civil servants on the Cape  had Indian experience, notably Lord Macartney and Sir John  Cradock. The tone of their administrations and the nature of  their concerns was reminiscent of that of Cornwallis's India. The  military element was strong. In 1810 there were 6,500 British troops  on the Cape, more than at Gibraltar or Malta, in addition to the large  para-military force of Dutch and their Hottentot servants which  were at the disposal of rural officers known as field-cornets. Even  though the first British administration ( 1796--1803) worked on the  assumption that the colony would be handed back to the Dutch, they  acted more purposefully than the Dutch Company had done against  both white and black dissidence. The settlers of Graaff Reinet in the  eastern Cape who harboured notions of republican independence  were swiftly brought to book, and jacobinism' was suppressed.  Xhosa incursions against the Cape colony were vigorously repulsed Proconsul.ar Despotisms: the British Emp;,re, c. 1800-40
 The evangelical Christianity of the Anglican establishment and  the Church of Scotland played a role in the formation of this British  order on the Cape, well before non-conformist influences became  stronger in the later 1820s. Since the Khoikoi and slaves were  already formal Christians or dependents of Europeans, there was  none of the reluctance to proselytise evident among officers in Asia.  Caledon in particular was keen to employ mission agencies whether  Dutch or British in the settlement of the expanding frontier. He  wrote to Castlereagh about the efforts of the Moravians: 'By the  exertions of the missionaries, the wandering natives are formed  into ... societies and taught by labour to supply their wants, whilst  the Hottentot soldier, formerly without a feeling of religion knows  the nature of an oath and appreciates its value' (PRO: CO 48/2, 4  Feb. 1808). There was no vigorous attempt to impose Anglicanism  on the Dutch population, and Church of Scotland missionaries  from a related Calvinist background played a prominent part in  British religious efforts. Still, the introduction of Anglican services,  English language, laws and schools created a subtle apex to the  social hierarchy of southern Africa from which the Dutch were, or  felt themselves to be, excluded. This perception of exclusion was of  some importance in stimulating the slow development of separatist  feeling among the Boers of.the interior.
 CANADA, AUSTRALIA AND THE CARIBBEAN Government at the Cape was an example of the classic dilemma  of an early imperial state trying to control the expansion of  'settler capitalism'. It bears comparison with the problems facing  contemporary British governors in western Canada where the fur  and logging economy was racing forward into Indian lands; and was  to have later parallels in Australia and New Zealand. It is only one of  a series of issues common to different parts of the early nineteenth- century empire. Religious conformity was another. By comparison  with the Cape where the Dutch Reformed Church was seen as a  tetchy ally in settlement, or the Mediterranean and Ireland where  Anglican evangelisation was limited by fear of Catholic reponse,  Canada saw a much more vigorous holding operation by English  episcopalians during these years. The Church had been endowed  with lands by the Constitution Act of 1791 and considerable  funds continued to pour in from England until the 1820s. SPG  missionaries taught in new schools which had been established  after 1 790 in the eastern provinces. They also found a base in  institutions such as the King's College of Nova Scotia, chartered  in 1802 and the empire's first university, or King's College of New  Brunswick which received its charter in 1829. The more vigorous  face of Anglicanism here reflected an imminent danger from the  secular United States. It was also an extension of the establishment's conquest of the Scottish Highlands in the previous generation, for  the communities particularly targeted for 'conversion' were Catholic  Highlanders such as those of Antigonish. The British tried to build  up a hereditary landlord and office-holding class to maintain this  Anglican settlement. The policy was supported by rising land prices  and the soaring value of timber resources which were maintained  at an artificially high rate by the huge tariffs levied on Baltic and  other non-British produce, even after the end of the war. On the  other hand, the attempts of governors to limit free constitutions  were less successful in these older colonies where a degree of  local representation had been built into their very foundations .  Sir James Craig as Governor suspended the assembly of Lower  Canada in 1807, but he and his colleagues were faced by a growing  and restive middle class of Francophone and Anglophone lawyers  and merchants.
 The Colonial Office responded vigorously, alarmed by the  precedent of the naval mutiny at Spithead and the Nore in  1796 and the pervasive atmosphere of republican libertarianism.  Lachlan Macquarie, the farmer 's son from Mull, was sent out to  quell the mutiny. He disbanded the NSW Corps and created his  own despotism through his complete control of all state offices.  In Macquarie's 'lairdship' there was nothing other than 'my reign ', 'my government' and 'my laws'. His policy also had a positive side.  He abandoned state tenures and tried to create an Australasian  'yeomanry'. He expanded trade with the Pacific Islands, and  surreptitiously with India. He rigorously controlled grain prices  through the government Commissariat, built Anglican churches  and schools. Macquarie, in fact, unleashed the policy which had  guaranteed the assimilation of the Highlands of Scotland a  generation earlier. His rule reflected not so much a long-term plan  evolved in London as a vigorous response to mutiny on the 'settler  frontier' (Ritchie 1986).
 It will be clear that the political arrangements and policies  operated in all these colonies were not simply examples of British  pragmatism or 'muddling through'. Though never planned from  the centre, they were enforced by similar military despotisms,  informed by similar autocratic ideals, and directed against  widespread and interlinked manifestations of social crisis.
 Yet there was one further general condition which linked the  political system in England with the form of colonial government.  That was the expansion of empire as a form of patronage  in office. Despite the controls introduced in the 1780s, Pitt's Proconsu/,ar Despotisms: the British Empire, c. 1800-40
 Different as were the forms of production in the Caribbean,  similar processes of social involution could be seen at work here also.  Ironically, the ending of the slave trade had the effect of curtailing  the movement of slaves into free society. The rising value of slaves  on the market and the inclination of the white owners acted against  manumission. And in conditions of depression in the plantation  sector during the 1820s, few black slaves could buy their own  freedom (Smith 1965: 101 ). The limited changes in the status of free  blacks and coloureds introduced by the autocratic governors and  other metropolitan influences had subtly increased the gradations  of rank within non-white society. White society had also changed.  One observer noted that in the 1780s 'the only distinction of ranks  consisted in white, coloured and negro persons' and blacksmiths  could be found at the white balls. But now 'there is a sufficient  number of secondary rank among the white people to form a society  among themselves', and one which mirrored the social order of the  motherland (Carmichael 1833: I, 18). The influence of Methodism  and revived Anglicanism along with the closer communications with  London had encouraged this involution of social rank. As ownership  of the plantations became less profitable, slave ownership and social rank became values in themselves, so that the effect of 'reform' and  metropolitan influence was to reinforce the caste-like nature of the  colonial society, not to undermine it.
 Most important of all, resistance in England to Catholic political  emancipation until 1829 wasted the political capital which had  been generated by Pitt's policy of political assimilation through  the Union, just as it rendered useless the policies of reconcilation  with Catholic gentry followed by successive viceroys. The imbalance  of political and economic power between Anglo-Irish and Celtic  society became confounded with the religious suspicion between  Protestant and Catholic. The lines were not yet hard drawn, but  in Daniel O'Connell's movement for emancipation and against the  Union, all the elements of Catholicism, gentry patriotism and rural  defence against the outside were coming together . The abolition  of anti-Catholic penal laws in 1829 was seen as a victory for mass  agitation and an acknowledgement of the ability of the Catholic  majority to make Ireland ungovernable if their aspirations were  thwarted. Since it was wrested from Britain and the Protestant Ascendancy by threat, rather than a concession made in the spirit of  reason and justice, it was bound to throw doubt on the future of the  Union itself. By the mid-1830s, the Young Ireland movement had  begun to sow the seeds of a revolutionary Catholic republicanism. So  it was the naked incompleteness of Pitt's policy of assimilation which  presaged its failure from the beginning (Beckett 1981: 304-5) .
 It has been useful to caricature the liberal Anglican view (as  Ronald Robinson calls it), and its unlikely bedfellows, Robinson  and Gallagher, because myths, after all, are part-truths. For much of  imperial history including, as we have seen, much of the eighteenth  century, colonial policy was indeed reactive and pragmatic, seeking  to pre-empt rather than to colonise and, above all, to save money.
 This book has traced some of the institutions and ideologies  which flourished in Pitt's Britain and were then modified and  exported to the new empire. These ideologies and institutions  were, of course, buckled and compromised by the conditions of  the societies into which they were introduced. But even if the  consequences of their introduction were often unintended, the  impulse cannot be ignored, for they affected not only Europeans  overseas, but also the particular histories of African, Asian and  American societies. 'Economical reform' of corrupt government  reinforced the financial basis of the state in Great Britain and  Ireland; its parallel in Asia and Africa was the creation of a new  administrative corps d'elite separated from European tradesmen  and 'native depravity'. 'Agrarian patriotism' and its paraphernalia  of statistical surveys and improving landlords was exported both in its English and Scottish form to the colonies where it had great  influence even though buckled by the pressur~s of indigenous  social change. 'Anti-slavery' and the missionary projects of both  the Anglican and Scottish Churches embraced attempts to discipline  and settle which were formative influences on colonial societies even  though direct proselytisation and assimilation were much less overt  than in the case of the Catholic powers.

 Gordon, who was inspired by the plight of the poor and the politics  of resistance that informed the religious revivals among the peasantry,  was baptized into the Native Baptist Church in 1861 after leaving the  Established Church and building the Tabernacle, his own Native Baptist  church in which Paul Bogle would act as a deacon, in kingston.134 Eyre’s  antipathy towards Gordon was based not only in political antagonism  but also in religious difference, insofar as Eyre’s devout Anglican beliefs,  which promoted a bourgeois morality that conflicted with those of reli- gious dissenters, was at odds with Gordon’s more liberationist vision.135

 The abolitionist debate –  spearheaded, in some cases, by those with med- ical training –  managed to place the medical care of slaves near the forefront of public concern. As a measure of this, one might note that in 1789, the Privy Council Committee systematically asked witnesses about the care of slaves in sickness, the laws that existed to regulate such care, and the provision for slaves when they were old and infi rm.  80   Colonial legislatures acted to place such laws on the books from the 1780s onwards. Yet much of the attention in the colonies had been reactive. Tracts about such medical care for the enslaved tended to dissipate after Wilberforce’s bill –  delayed until 1791 –  sputtered in the House, the country’s political mood swinging against radical reform in the aftermath of the French Revolution. In 1792 all Wilberforce was able to extract from his fellow parliamentarians was the agreement on a ‘gradual abolition’ of 76      Ibid ., 75– 6.
 Political reform at the highest level was carried out in the context of tremendous public debate about imperial questions. As Catherine Hall has shown, the years leading up to the passage of the Great Reform Act, which did away with ‘‘rotten’’ boroughs and expanded the electorate by approx- imately 60 percent across the United Kingdom in 1832, were preceded by elaborate discussions of citizenship in a variety of ‘‘colonial’’ contexts.≥ Ireland was one. Although Britons did not typically use the word ‘‘colony’’ for Ireland at the time, in Hall’s view it was a colony ‘‘in that Irish Catholics in Ireland were treated as a conquered people and English Protestants in Ireland acted as colonial settlers.’’∂ Religious di√erence carried with it overtones of racial di√erence, and Irish Catholics were politically disen- franchised as well as culturally subordinated. Daniel O’Connell’s work with the Catholic Association, and especially his speeches to Parliament, placed civil rights for the Catholic Irish at the heart of political debate and made it clear that the peace and stability of the whole of the United Kingdom was in peril if political emancipation at the periphery closest in was not forthcoming. Unrest in Upper and Lower Canada in this period added to the sense that the empire was in crisis.∑ Jamaica was another very visible colonial context in which debates about political reform occurred in the 1830s. Parliament was preoccupied with events in Jamaica in the two years leading up to the passage of the Reform Act of 1832, especially in the wake of the Christmas rebellion in December 1831, in which free black men and women sought to overthrow slavery and were brutally repressed.∏ As in Ireland, the language of civil rights and the threat to private property in Jamaica set the stage for a quite conservative Reform Bill in 1832, one that en- franchised about 400,000 men in the United Kingdom but that left the ma- jority of British men and all British women without the parliamentary vote.

 Christianity spread among slaves in the British Caribbean from the end of the eighteenth century. But for many decades its impact was limited. The Church of England did not promote a proselytizing role in the West Indian colonies and many African slaves clung to their beliefs such as Obeah and Myal. There were exceptions to the poor penetration of the Anglican Church in the British Caribbean, however. The major one lay in the educational work and preaching undertaken on the Codrington plantations in Barbados by the SPG. This left a durable legacy in the form of Codrington College, established on the island and still flourishing today. But it was the work of nonconformist missionaries that played a greater role in spreading the Christian gospels to slaves. The Moravians were active in missions in Jamaica from 1754 and in a few other islands. The great phase of expansion of missionary activity came after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, when the Baptists, Congregationists, and Methodists rapidly expanded their presence in the Caribbean. By the time of slave emancipation, for example, there were fourteen Wesleyan missions, twelve Baptist, nine Moravian, and six Presbyterian missions in Jamaica. All but four had been established in and after 1815.
 Nonconformist missionaries were guided by their parent societies in Britain. In an age of frequent bickering between nonconformist denominations at home, and between Anglicans and Dissenters, it is unsurprising to find that a sectarian element embedded itself in the mis- sionaries’ preaching. Dissenting missionaries played an important role, however, in spreading literacy and Christian moral instruction among British Caribbean slaves. They linked up with the non-denominational British and Foreign School Society, with its Lancasterian monitorial principles, and with the Mico Charity, originally a way of aiding the victims of Barbary piracy, to spread the teaching of the three R’s in mission schools. Attempts by missionaries to absorb the slaves’ spiritual customs stemming from their ancestors were not always successful, but myalism took over some Christian practices such as the practice of baptism by full immersion in water that was favoured by the Baptists. In the years after the end of slavery parts of Christianity and African religious beliefs combined to form a set of hybrid cultural beliefs in the British West Indies, but the fusion was never full enough to overcome the social and racial gulf between blacks and Europeans in the tropics.
 Various Ladies’ Anti-Slavery Associations were formed, in which middle-class women used their energy and spare time to distribute leaflets, cajole people to sign petitions, and publicize antislavery meet- ings. The first British women’s antislavery society was formed by Lucy Townsend in Birmingham. Such associations could be found in Glas- gow, Bristol, Sheffield, Manchester, and other cities—not just in the main ports associated with the slave trade. They provided an important outlet for political participation by women at a time when they were excluded from Parliament and public office and were not allowed to be members of national organizations or sign petitions (though they could contribute funds). They drew heavily on nonconformist congregations, in which women had always been prominent in numbers and leadership. The local women’s antislavery society in Sheffield, consisting of eighty members in 1825, was just one of several groups that actively propagated the abolitionist message in urban areas. Abolitionist leaders recognized the important contribution made by female efforts in the antislavery cause. The funds raised by women’s antislavery societies were reported in the pages of the Anti-Slavery Reporter.
 NONCONFORMISTS AND ABOLITIONISTS Stronger links were forged between nonconformist groups and abolition- ists in the late 1820s. But the support varied according to denomination. The Quakers and Unitarians, both relatively small in numbers, made less of an impact on this phase of abolitionism, the Quakers because they had long lost the leadership of a Benezet or a Woolman and the Unitarians because they were more disposed to see the amelioration of slavery rather than its demise. The Baptists, Congregationalists, and the Methodists were more prominent in the antislavery campaigns in the final years of British slavery. Scottish Presbyterians also played their part, though to a lesser extent. The Methodists, in particular, were vir- tually unanimous in their condemnation of slavery on moral grounds: over 229,000 Methodists signed antislavery petitions presented to Par- liament in 1833 when total Methodist membership was just under 233,000 people.
 The Baptists, Methodists, and Congregationalists believed in the efficacy of missionary endeavour among slaves; though they admonished missionaries to teach slaves to be obedient to masters, the blacks often used the Christian principles they imbibed to underpin their right to resist tyranny. Missionaries were active in virtually all the Caribbean islands by this time. They were mainly Wesleyan Methodists but included a fair number of Baptists, Congregationalists, and Moravians. In Jamaica, for example, the earliest mission stations were Moravian establishments of 1754 at Carmel and 1760 at Mesopotamia plantation. Another mission station did not appear in the island until 1790, when the Wesleyans arrived at Kingston. Between 1802 and 1834 another fourteen Wesleyan Methodist missions were established in Jamaica along with eleven Baptist, eight Moravian, and six Presbyterian missions. The missionary presence spread to the Cape Colony, where there were six Moravian mission stations by 1834.
 The missionaries’ presence and their pastoral and evangelical work among the slaves filled a gap left by the relative indifference of the established church and its representatives to the plight of blacks in bondage. While it is true that the Anglican church established bishoprics in Jamaica and Barbados in the aftermath of the Demerara rebellion, the Church establishment looked down upon much missionary activity as smacking of ‘enthusiasm’. Dissenting missionaries and abolitionists, however, were imbued with a firm sense that God’s Providence upheld the moral order in the world. In order to achieve Salvation, redemption was necessary and this could only be achieved, as far as slavery was concerned, by the destruction of physical bondage.
 The political atmosphere changed markedly in the two years from 1828 to 1830, however, as Tory administrations experienced leadership problems and faced public clamour for the reform of institutions long untouched that could no longer avoid change. Pressure placed on parliament in those two years led to severe cracks in England’s ‘ancien régime’. In 1828 the Test and Corporation Acts were repealed. Enacted as two pieces of separate legislation under Charles II, they had effectively excluded dissenters and Catholics from attending universities, becoming members of Parliament, and holding other public offices. This was followed by Catholic Emancipation in 1829, which gave Roman Catholics, including those in Ireland, the right to the franchise and to take up their seats in Parliament and hold public office. In less than two years, therefore, two pillars of the entrenched political system had been swept away. These changes split the Tory Party severely. The diehards thought this was the beginning of the break-up of the British Constitution, with the indissoluble bond between the State and the Church of England ruptured. The Liberal Tories regarded the situation as one in which, backs to the wall, concessions were necessary to forestall further major political change. The disarray of the Tories, their defeat at the general election in 1830, and the arrival of a Whig government for the first time in half a century gave great impetus and hope for two further reforms—the reform of Parliament, something not dealt with seriously for centuries, and the campaign to emancipate slaves in the British Empire.
 The credit for achieving slave emancipation in the British Empire must be given to the continued pressure of the abolitionists inside and outside Parliament; to the greater involvement of nonconformist groups in a moral and humanitarian struggle; to the good fortune of a sea change in the political climate after the Tory Party fell into disarray in the late 1820s; to the election of a Whig government determined to legislate on slave emancipation; to the effective work of the Agency Committee lecturers; and to the role played by missionaries and slaves in the Caribbean, notably in the Jamaican slave revolt in 1831, in demonstrating the urgency of the need for slave emancipation. These various facets of the antislavery movement coalesced in the five years after c.1828 to produce the momentum necessary for the rapid demise of slavery in the Caribbean.
 When it comes to Greece, he argued that all Greek colonies were created from scattered and various populations and not from a single stock. He referred to the case of Thurii, a colony of the fifth century BCE, in this respect: if the Thurians could not decide who their founder was, then one can imagine how things were in earlier colonies, and why we have so many different reports concerning the founders of colonies (oikists).77 He referred to Bryant's Analysis of ancient  mythology78 to support his argument that Ionia was not colonized from Athens.79

 What happened in the secular world was replicated—indeed even more significantly and irreversibly so—in the world of ecclesiastical politics. It was among churchmen, as we shall see, that the ideas of an all-Britain, indeed an all-British Isles, unit of authority were most fondly cherished in the early twelfth century.25 It was in this sphere that they were now both ideologically and organizationally challenged. Canterbury’s pretensions to primatial author- ity over Ireland were finally scuppered at the synod of Kells in 1152 with the establishment of four archbishoprics in Ireland; plans, already being pro- moted in the 1120s, for metropolitan status for St Andrews over the Scottish Church did not meet with success but the papacy increasingly treated Scotland as an autonomous ecclesiastical unit (a position which was eventually and very 23 See, most recently, David Crouch, ‘The March and the Welsh Kings’, and Geoffrey Barrow, ‘The Scots and the North of England’, in The Anarchy of King Stephen’s Reign, ed.

 who indulge in such auctions can hardly be said to place the overlordship of the British Isles high on their agenda.
 A single Britain was more than a political aspiration; it was also an ecclesi- astical dream. Indeed in the late eleventh and early twelfth century, it was churchmen above all who kept the idea alive and for their own purposes. It was after all an idea with an apostolic lineage to it. From the earliest cor- respondence of Pope Gregory the Great and St Augustine of Canterbury, the unit which was, at least theoretically, the object of salvation and ecclesiastical organization was Britain. Indeed what else could one call it? So it was that 20 English Historical Documents, c.500–1042, ed. D. Whitelock (2nd edn, 1979), 548–9, 560, 563; Eric John, Orbis Britanniae and Other Studies (Leicester, 1966), esp. ch. 1; Henry Loyn, Society and Peoples.

 Augustine was given the designation ‘archbishop of the Britains’, and one of his most distinguished successors, Theodore, that of ‘archbishop of the island of Britain and the see of Canterbury’.23 And so the examples could be multi- plied. What is more, those examples and the Ecclesiastical History of Bede— with its clear yearning for a single and orthodox Church of Britain—were assiduously studied at Canterbury in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Such texts and such titles were now deployed in order to bolster Canterbury’s claim to primacy over York and to metropolitan power over the whole of Britain and indeed Ireland also. For about eighty years after 1070 the Norman arch- bishops of Canterbury showed remarkable, if spasmodic, tenacity in the pursuit of such claims. Lanfranc, Anselm, and their successors recurrently flaunted titles such as ‘primate of the whole of Britain’; their spokesmen, such as Eadmer and John of Salisbury, frequently referred to Canterbury as ‘the mother of Britain’ or ‘the first see of Britain’. Just in case there was any ambiguity as to the meaning of that phrase, it was specifically spelt out by Archbishop Anselm: ‘primate of the whole of England, Scotland, Ireland and the adjacent isles’.24 Men of the mind are always more likely to be seduced by such grand abstractions than men of muscle. But even ecclesiastics were shrewd enough to realize that their ambitions might find even more favour if they could be supported by arguments of political expediency. And so they were. ‘It would be expedient for the solidarity of the kingdom,’ so Archbishop Lanfranc is alleged to have argued, ‘that all Britain should be subject to one primate.’ In short, Britain should have one king and one archbishop.25
 Such ambitions were shattered in the twelfth century. Canterbury’s hopes for primacy over the British Isles were denied it by the papacy, first by the establishment of four archbishoprics for Ireland and later by taking the Scot- tish Church directly under its own wing. It was left merely with Wales, and even there its hold was recurrently challenged. The ‘mother of Britain’ had 23 Bede, II, c. 3–4; IV, c. 17. 24 From many examples one might cite the following: Councils and Synods, ed. D. Whitelock, M. Brett, and C. N. L. Brooke (Oxford, 1981), II, 619; The Letters of Lanfranc, ed. H. Clover and M. T. Gibson (Oxford, 1979), 50–1; Margaret Gibson, Lanfranc (Oxford, 1978), 121; Eadmer, Historia Novorum in Anglia, ed. M. Rule (R.S., 1884), 26, 42, 189; Hugh the Chantor, The History of the Church of York 1066–1127, ed. C. Johnson (1961), 7, 126–7; John of Salisbury, Letters, ed. W. J. Millor et al., 2 vols. (1955–79), II, 466, 499; Episcopal Acts re Welsh Dioceses, ed. J. Conway Davies, I, 240 (D.38). It is interesting to note how Bede’s phrase ‘all of the church of the English’ (IV, c. 2) was transmuted by Eadmer into ‘all the bishops of Britain’ (Historia Novorum, 282). For a full discussion of Canterbury’s claims, see M. T. Flanagan, Irish Society (as cited above, Ch. 1, n. 17), ch. 1. Simultaneously the archbishops of York were claiming that all the bishoprics of Scotland were their suffragans, in accordance with Gregory the Great’s grand plan for the ecclesiastical organization of Britain: Regesta Regum Scottorum, I, The Acts of Malcolm IV, ed. G. W. S. Barrow (Edinburgh, 1960), 16–17.
 terms of ecclesiastical organization, were eventually forced to readjust their ambitions. It was partly that the language of ecclesiastical pretension could not indefinitely remain out of alignment with the terminology of state power: even Eadmer, vigorous defender of Canterbury’s pan-British claims that he was, referred to his lord of Canterbury as ‘archbishop of the English’ and to ‘the whole church as it is constituted in England’.68 And an English church, with a Welsh appendage, is what it became in the twelfth century, as Canterbury was denied the last vestiges of its theoretical claim to supremacy over Scotland and Ireland.69 The Church of the Britains had contracted into the ecclesia anglicana, and it was the liberties of that Church that King John guaranteed in the opening clause of Magna Carta.
 so it was likewise that the remarkable school of historians of the early twelfth century—notably William of Malmesbury and Henry of Huntingdon— constructed their histories around the theme of the unification of England and arranged their chronologies around the reigns of its kings—as have their successors ever since;13 so it was again that characters as different as Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales advocated unitary rule as the only road to political salvation, and disunity and civil war as an inevitable prelude to chaos.14 In its essence this paradigm of the good political life was increasingly shared by the political classes of the Scottish kingdom or at least of southern and eastern Scotland. There likewise a unitary kingship, the creation and acceptance of a large and stable unit of political authority, the introduction of the English-type shire as the unit of governance, and the claims of a ‘common law’ of Scotland brought much of Scotland—for all its differences in institu- tional forms and practice—increasingly closer into alignment with the polit- ical culture of England. Ralph Pipard could have travelled into lowland Scotland without undue fear of finding himself in a totally alien political environment.
 Apart from mastering the skills of wealth accumulation, there was another stumbling-block which the Welsh would have to overcome if they were to qualify for membership of the English state, that of learning the arts of what Edmund Spenser called ‘sweet civility ’. Bishop William Barlow of St David’s (1536–48) took a rather more generous view of Welsh potential in this respect than did Rowland Lee, but even so he had no doubt that a period of cultural and educational re-orientation was necessary. If provision were made, he suggested, ‘for learning as well as in grammar as in other sciences and knowledge of the Scripture, the Welsh rudeness would soon be framed to English civility and their corrupt capacities easily reformed into godly intelligence’ (my italics).4 Barlow’s recipe for civilizing the Welsh was in no way novel. It had, for example, been much more amply laid out by Archbishop John Pecham (1279–92) in the wake of Edward I’s conquest of the country. Indeed, Pecham’s programme had involved not only ecclesiastical and moral reform but also ideological cleansing (to wean the Welsh from their fantasies about descent from the Trojans), economic indoctrination, particularly regarding the virtues of hard work, and deliberate resettlement in towns ( just as the Romans had resettled the Burgundians), so that, in the archbishop’s words, the Welsh could be brought ‘to the knowledge of unity with English lordship and the English people’ (my italics)—a pregnant and suggestive phrase indeed.5

 rather than specifically English. The changes in monastic practice and reli- gious organization were often introduced by native rulers independently, and chronologically often well in advance, of English power and domina- tion. This, for example, is pre-eminently true of the impact of the so-called papal reform movement and of the new monastic orders in Ireland, Scotland, Galloway, and in a measure Wales.84 Furthermore, Canterbury’s vision of a single British or indeed British and Irish Church under its ultimate control— an ecclesiastical vision to match the prospect of a single high kingship—was recurrently thwarted during the twelfth century and had been finally dashed before the century was out.85

 adopted English ecclesiastical custom’—including organization into parishes and the payment of tithes.87 Likewise, the coming of the English to Ireland was accompanied by the further creation of parishes, the requirement to pay tithes, and the aggregation of parishes into rural deaneries.88

 So was solved, at least terminologically and in English eyes, the question of the relationship of England to Britain, even to the British isles. It was a solution which has done good service ever since. But, of course, it was a 31 Quoted as above, Ch. 1, n. 39. 32 W.

 were in place. Similarly, “all landed and commercial transactions were now recognizably English.”50 During the eighteenth century, Ireland had its own parliament, suggesting a degree of autonomy. Yet, as Thomas Bartlett has pointed out, this was not unique to Ireland; at the time, representative institutions also existed elsewhere in the British Empire.51
 2 A “great body corporate” 1857 and the sinews of empire Within hours of receiving a request for assistance from the governor of Bombay, George Grey sprung to action. The Cape Colony governor immediately proposed the transfer of regiments, horses, artillery, and even money to support the British cause in India. In doing so, he claimed to be motivated by a sense of imperial responsibility. In moments of crisis, he explained to the Colonial Office, it was essential that all parts of the empire “simultaneously stir themselves to meet the emergency”; furthermore, he insisted, they needed to do so without first contacting London. The empire, after all, was more than a loose collection of isolated colonies. According to Grey, it was “a great body corporate” and each colony a “useful” member of the whole.1 Although one of the first to assist the British in India in 1857, Grey was not the only colonial administrator to do so; nor was he the only Briton to recognize the potential strength of a unified empire in which different colonies supported each other during moments of crisis. Throughout the empire, colonial officials and settlers scrambled to provide assistance for their kinsmen overseas.
 While press networks provided a crucial means of spreading news of the rebellion, other colonial connections often shaped reception. In par- ticular, familial connections ensured that the news reports would be read with interest throughout the empire. In 1857, it was not unusual for impe- rial participation to be a family affair. Many of the individuals famously associated with the suppression of the uprising – John Lawrence, Henry Havelock, and Frederick Sleigh Roberts – came from families with long military traditions. Some even had family members who were also serving in India in 1857 or stationed elsewhere in the empire. John Lawrence had two brothers, Henry and George, who were also noted for holding key military positions in India during the uprising. Similarly, the Graham family, originally from Ulster, had five family members in India when the rebellion began. These families of the empire were not restricted to the military; similar stories emerged within the empire’s missionary enterprise and among other colonists.
 The colonies respond The same connections that shaped individual reactions to the uprising also conditioned official and collective responses. Initially, colonial offi- cials and settlers relied heavily on imperial networks to generate support for the British project in India, and many scrambled to provide assis- tance. This flurry of support, however, quickly gave way to concerns. With time, and as the situation in India worsened, many in the colonies raised questions regarding colonial obligations. The following sections will examine these more formal contributions to British efforts overseas and the resulting questions regarding colonial responsibility and imperial unity.
 In preparation, the bishop circulated prayers to be included in service on three consecutive Sundays. Furthermore, he suggested to his fellow members of the clergy that they provide their congregations with “some brief explanation of what has been peculiar in the service for the day.” He warned, however, that the explanation should not be mistaken for an opportunity to dwell on the violence in India; when it came to “those 70 Dublin Evening Mail, October 7, 1857. Although many Protestants observed the day, some Irish nationalists mocked it. The Nation, for example, noted that the day of humiliation was “rather unnecessary” as the British had already experienced months of “humiliation” at the hands of the Indian sepoys. See Nation, October 3, 1857.
 When news of the uprising reached the colonies, the response was varied. Many individuals and colonial bodies responded immediately with offers of assistance. Others recommended transporting disbanded sepoys and suspected mutineers to new colonial locations. In each of these exam- ples, colonial officials and settlers debated both the colonial and imperial impact. Indeed, support for British efforts in India was rarely offered unconditionally; relief did not come without questions, debate, or even stipulations. When providing spiritual, military, or economic relief, indi- viduals and colonial bodies wanted recognition for their efforts. Further- more, many wanted assurance that the potential promise and strength of the “great body corporate” would also be there to assist them in their hour of need.
 While the idea that the Indian rebellion might represent the begin- ning of the end for the British appeared plausible in Ireland, it is more difficult to trace in other regions of the empire. Certainly, the empire witnessed an increasing number of indigenous and pan-tribal organi- zations, often developed as resistance measures against the British. In 1858, for example, Maori chiefs unified under the King Movement and selected the aged and hesitant warrior Potatau te Wherowhero as the Maori king.92 According to James Belich, the King Movement rep- resented an “unprecedented” show of pan-tribalism.93 Although the movement did not include all of Maoridom, it was an option for all Maori to join. This “very embryonic and incomplete sense of col- lective identity” can be traced in part to “a vague sense of shared unEuropeaness.”94 It cannot, however, be traced to the 1857 Indian rebellion. The King Movement had been taking shape throughout the 1850s and was proposed prior to the uprising in India. Even after the Indi- ans rebelled, I have found no direct evidence that the King Movement or any Maori unrest drew inspiration from the Indians or anyone else overseas.
 Furthermore, members of the press in New Zealand drew distinctions between colonized peoples and wrestled with efforts to “divide and rule,” mix regiments, and create a defense policy that both involved colonial people and reinforced British control. As in 1857, a number of different colonized people and possible solutions came under review. Although Wilson placed his faith in the Gurkhas, not everyone agreed that the Nepalese soldiers presented the best option. Major General H. Troup, one of Wilson’s most vocal opponents, had long advocated the use of Sikh troops. According to Troup, the Gurkhas were expensive, inferior soldiers, and prone to mutiny. The Sikhs, on the other hand, had “few prejudices, either religious or social,” and, “if properly treated,” could be “easily managed.” As a result, a Sikh would prove to be the better “man” and could benefit the colony as “either as a soldier or agriculturist.”73
 Similar calls for decisive action emerged elsewhere in the empire, and not just among people in positions of military or administrative power. Members of the armed services, the clergy, the colonial press, and indi- vidual colonists all pointed to the violence of 1857 as a legitimate reason to dispel potential unrest. As early as 1859, having received word of nationalist efforts in Belfast, James Graham wrote to his sister in Ire- land, “I cannot make out what your Belfast Phoenix Club people want; a landing of the American in Ireland to assist them in getting what!” While Graham seemed confused by the movement, he did not hesitate to suggest a response. “They ought to be put down with a strong arm. Give them [the authorities] a special commission as they did formerly, and hang not only all concerned but everyone that harbours them. They will then have met the just reward of their ingratitude.”124 Graham suggested that, like the sepoys in India, the nationalists in Ireland had expressed a lack of gratitude for British rule. And, fresh from suppressing the Indian rebellion, he recommended a similar “strong arm” response.
 In the end, colonial officials performed a balancing act. They openly acknowledged and rewarded “loyal” Maori leaders, but embraced force at the first signs of dissent. The Maori representatives remained a part of the colony’s political institutions; in fact, the number of Maori repre- sentatives increased during the early 1870s. As Bowen explained to the Colonial Office, it was “at once more politic and more humane to out- live the King Movement” than to “suppress it by the strong hand.” The colonists, he continued, needed to encourage “the turbulent natives” to “live peaceably.” The strong hand, however, would still come out when- ever necessary. “[M]urderous onslaughts whether on the Europeans or on the friendly Maori,” he explained, “should be punished with the rigour necessary to prevent a recurrence of unprovoked aggressions.”73 Hand in hand, these methods sought the same outcomes: to ensure Maori loy- alty and reinforce British authority. Force provided a means to establish power, and political institutions provided a method to maintain control.

 Religion The British Empire also grew through Protestantism. Anti-Catholicism spurred British empire-building and Protestantism shaped the British Atlantic world from the Reformation to the American Revolution. It united the Atlantic world whilst simultaneously sowing religious diversity and fragmentation. The Reformation involved a clash of peoples and beliefs in England, Scotland, Ireland, parts of North and South America, the Caribbean, and Africa, and fuelled colonial expansion as bitter rivalries prompted fierce competition for souls. Despite officially promoting religious homogeneity, the English found it impossible to prevent the conflicts in their homeland from infecting their new colonies. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a major theme relating to empire, in terms of migration, expansion, and cultural relations, was the growth of powerful missionary societies and humanitarian activism. Most famously this was associated with the abolition of slavery, an endeavour that continued late into the nineteenth century as the desire to defeat, for example, the Arab slave trade, provided a new rallying call for missionary activity and colonial expansion to underwrite it.

 An additional factor, which enhances network efficiency, is the pres- ence of individuals in the network whose role is to ensure that infor- mation circulates as freely and widely as possible. Such individuals are  in many ways the true architects of social capital. There is no specific  background or training that singles people out for this role. They can be  politicians, bureaucrats, entrepreneurs, professionals, spiritual teachers  or just highly motivated individuals. Yet, whatever their origins, their  work, if embedded within a conducive institutional environment, can  be pivotal in making networks work well. Crucial to the functioning  of medieval fairs of Champagne, for example, were the private judges  that operated under the Law Merchant.

 The Orange Lodge Order – the fraternity at the heart of Ulster  Unionism – was likewise well established in the dominion, where it  functioned as a ‘community-building frontier organisation’.93 Its birth- place was in Ontario among loyalist settlers who were determined to  maintain their religious convictions and defend British institutions, and  who ‘shared a belief in future greatness and progress achieved as an  integral part of the British Empire’.94 There were possibly as many as  100,000 Ontarian Orangemen by the end of the nineteenth century.95  For Irish Protestants in the province Orangeism was a way of life. Its  branches (or lodges) were ‘an avenue of association’, serving to extend  ‘a colonial frame of mind’ among settlers who were becoming increas- ingly aware of the growing threat from the world’s great republic to  the south, and from Catholic, French-speaking Quebec to the east.96  Thus, by the early 1900s, the Order was a social and political force to  be reckoned with.97
 empire was built into the terminology of Orangeism, but in a way that  did not exclude the United States. With regard to the law, language and  other facets of culture, America remained a part, if an ambiguous one,  of the British diaspora. That said, the Order was weaker in the United  States, where, by the later nineteenth century, there were approximately  only 10,000 members belonging to some 350 lodges (6 per cent of the  world’s total), largely confined to the north-east and areas adjacent to  the Canadian border. Unsurprisingly, the American republic did not  warm to an organisation devoted to the maintenance of British constitu- tional and cultural forms. Orangemen living there had to downplay their  monarchist tradition and imperial sympathies, and to look instead to  other ‘nativist’ groups – such as the American Protestant Association – to  defend their religious interests.98

 The abolitionist debate –  spearheaded, in some cases, by those with med- ical training –  managed to place the medical care of slaves near the forefront of public concern. As a measure of this, one might note that in 1789, the Privy Council Committee systematically asked witnesses about the care of slaves in sickness, the laws that existed to regulate such care, and the provision for slaves when they were old and infi rm.  80   Colonial legislatures acted to place such laws on the books from the 1780s onwards. Yet much of the attention in the colonies had been reactive. Tracts about such medical care for the enslaved tended to dissipate after Wilberforce’s bill –  delayed until 1791 –  sputtered in the House, the country’s political mood swinging against radical reform in the aftermath of the French Revolution. In 1792 all Wilberforce was able to extract from his fellow parliamentarians was the agreement on a ‘gradual abolition’ of 76      Ibid ., 75– 6.
 The point about all of this activity, however, is that the press was part of a wider intellectual ferment, connected in a variety of ways to the establishment of literary and scientific societies, to frontier and ‘native’ policy, to the abolition of slavery, and to missionary endeavour, partic- ularly as personified by yet another Scot, the London Missionary Society superintendent, Dr John Philip. The press, which Somerset made strenuous but failing attempts to suppress, was part of a wider creation of a bourgeois, intellectual and also commercial public sphere. The Scots were motivated not just by the ambition to influence matters of governance, religion and frontier settlement, but also to create banking, insurance and commercial institutions. The press was a vehicle for all these concerns, much influenced by Adam Smith and other figures of the Scottish Enlightenment. By 1853, the efforts of this group (in league with influential Dutch and English allies) culminated in the establishment of representative government at the Cape.
 Somerset and the ‘Scotch Independents’ Three Scottish figures dominated this tempestuous period at the Cape, and the developments of the 1820s can only be understood in terms of their background. The first of these to arrive was Dr John Philip (1775–1851), the highly influential superintendent of the London Missionary Society.8 Philip was the son of a handloom weaver from Fife, and born therefore into a social group that was to be most disadvantaged by the developing industrialism of the period. Well schooled, he worked at a mill in Dundee in the 1790s, an experience which contributed to his sense of social injustice. By 1799 he believed he had a vocation and went to the Congregationalist college at Hoxton to train as a minister. He was duly ordained in the Congregationalist Church, then increasingly powerful in Scotland, and in 1804 became minister of a church in Aberdeen. There he began to display his radical tendencies, his belief in the relationship between religion and politics, and his search for a particular kind of practical and involved evangeli- calism. He was also a powerful and popular preacher, frequently filling a large church to capacity.
 4  ‘The Old Pals’ Protection Society’?  The Colonial Office and the British  Press on the Eve of Decolonisation  Joanna Lewis and Philip Murphy As the 1950s drew to a close, there was a growing awareness on the part of British ministers and officials of the power of the media and the need for ‘news management’. As Harold Macmillan noted in his memoirs, by 1959 he and his colleagues fought elections in the company of two new developments: television and opinion polls.1 Yet there remained a tradition under which civil servants were expected to remain relatively aloof from the world of journalism, and ministers expected a degree of deference from the press. The Colonial Office (CO) in particular was keen to keep its own affairs from the critical scrutiny not only of the media but of Parliament itself, fearing that public disagreements about policy within the metropole would weaken the authority of its personnel in the colonies.2 In this regard the issues of press coverage and parliamentary scrutiny were closely interlinked. Through the mechanism of parliamentary questions, MPs may well have played a more significant role than journalists in holding the Government to account.3 Yet a large proportion of those questions were inspired by reports in the press, and ministerial replies could, in turn, encourage further investigations by the media.
 1. Harold Macmillan, Pointing the Way, 1959–1961 (London: Macmillan, 1972), p. 7.  2. See, for example, the resistance of the CO to the idea of the establishment of a specialist parliamentary committee on colonial affairs because of fears that its activities might ‘exacerbate public opinion in the colonial territories’ (Watt to Smart, 24 September 1958, CO 1032/135).
 Although New Zealand was only ‘a subplot in the diaspora of Europeans that sent as many as 50 million from the Old World to the New’,10 it became a keen and committed part of the Empire. But was the colonial experience weaker and less effective because communications were difficult? We should keep in mind that New Zealand was considered ‘More English than England!’, resulting perhaps from its isolation, so that it clung to ‘the ideas traditionally associated with the Victorian Age which nurtured her in infancy and early youth’, and was ‘untouched by the revolutionary solvents of the twentieth century’.11
 and also would have destabilised the “civilising mission” and Britain’s  moral authority in colonies.145
 An additional factor, which enhances network efficiency, is the pres- ence of individuals in the network whose role is to ensure that infor- mation circulates as freely and widely as possible. Such individuals are  in many ways the true architects of social capital. There is no specific  background or training that singles people out for this role. They can be  politicians, bureaucrats, entrepreneurs, professionals, spiritual teachers  or just highly motivated individuals. Yet, whatever their origins, their  work, if embedded within a conducive institutional environment, can  be pivotal in making networks work well. Crucial to the functioning  of medieval fairs of Champagne, for example, were the private judges  that operated under the Law Merchant. According to Paul Milgrom,  Douglass North and Barry Weingast, one of the duties of these judges  was ‘to transmit just enough information to the right person in the  right circumstances to enable the reputation mechanism to function 34 Glaeser, Laibson and Sacredote, ‘Economic Approach’, p. 13; Bowles and Gintis,  ‘Community Governance’, p. 423.

 Other social changes have had important impacts. Church and mis- sion, often unintentionally, provided a route to secular enlightenment. Literacy brought with it a new critical understanding of colonial history. Newfound knowledge and contacts were used to agitate for rights and freedom, and establish independent churches and political parties. Since the 1930s, urbanization and greater mobility offered new opportunities for learning, earning, and networking. Aboriginal soldiers went to fight in two world wars and came back decorated and chastened, wondering about the disparity between how they were treated as equals on foreign battlefields yet as inferiors at home on ‘civvy street’. The rise of aborig- inal print and broadcast media gave this population a public voice; in particular radio, and later electronic media, united far-flung and isolated communities.

 The Navy was politically moderate and Elizabethan in its outlook. The army, in contrast, became more radical as the war went on. Charles became parliament’s prisoner in 1647. When parliament tried to come to terms with Charles and disband the army, the troops mutinied and occupied London. The revolt was led by the radical religious and political elements in it, the Independents and Levellers, who were opposed to the moderate views of most MPs. They did not want a settlement with Charles. In 1647 the army radicals demanded universal male suffrage and religious freedom. The army was the most powerful force in the country.
 Being a Catholic in seventeenth-century England was hard enough. Being heir to the throne did not ease things – in fact it exacerbated them. Catholicism was identified as un-English and, above all, tyrannical. The Great Fire of London in 1666 was believed to be the work of an international Catholic conspiracy hell-bent on wrecking the Anglican Church and stamping arbitrary government onto free England. From 1661 Louis XIV (a Catholic of course) aimed to establish Universal Monarchy – or French hegemony – over Europe. In 1677 Titus Oates, a disgraced naval chaplain, told the world of a Catholic conspiracy to assassinate Charles II, an act that would bring James to the throne. It was all fiction, but there followed a wave of hysteria and attempts in parliament to exclude James from the succession. ‘I think,’ said one MP, ‘the sun is not more visible at noon-day, than that the Papists have a design to extirpate our religion . . . we have discovered that their weapons are near our throats, so we shall not acquiesce in anything less than may secure us; that so, if possible, we may not fall into the hands of such bloody, merciless people; which must infallibly be the consequence of having a Popish King.’2
 Herbert was a product of James’s Navy and a beneficiary of James’s patronage; he was notoriously lax in his morals and untroubled by a political or religious conscience; yet he was one of the first to withdraw his support for the regime on the grounds of principle. He was dismissed from his offices and began to talk to other disaffected men. The most important of these was Edward Russell. Like Herbert, Russell had enjoyed James’s support in ascending the ladder of promotion in the Navy and establishing himself at court.

 vision, many others found religious justifications for planting and plunder.  Many sea dogs envisioned themselves as seaborne crusaders of the Protes- tant Reformation. Being that Drake was the son of a Protestant minister, his  alleged piety and enforced shipboard prayers were a crucial component of his  legend. At the forefront of this crusading spirit were those who did not think  the Tudors had taken the Reformation far enough. This faction believed the  true, pure church should resemble as closely as possible that of Jesus and his  apostles. Puritans, as their detractors called them, wanted to tear down these  false structures that the Pope and his minions had built. Antipopery meant  radical iconoclasm, like smashing stained- glass windows and defacing statues  of the Virgin Mary. Whereas many Puritans focused on cleansing the Anglican  Church from within, others argued that in order to usher in the apocalypse,  they must fight the papists beyond England’s shores.9
 Indies, his basic arguments about sovereignty on land and the sea were par- ticularly popular among militant Protestants like the earl of Warwick and  English colonists.34

Merchants at Boston, Dec. 11, 1646, CO 1/11, no. 9; Dunn, Savage, and Yeandle, eds., Journal of John  Winthrop, 490. Mark A. Peterson has noted that Puritans were eager to obtain treasure because  “religion was expensive.” Maintaining learned ministers (sometimes two in one church), a system  of public education, purchase of books, and the many other expenses to live a godly life could add  up quickly. He argues, “The growth of Puritanism, the continuous nurturing of its inner vitality,  and the spread of orthodox churches across the New England landscape required the material  and cultural resources produced by an expanding commercial economy.” Indeed, “money sown  to the spirit would reap divine rewards” (Peterson, The Price of Redemption: The Spiritual Economy  of Puritan New England [Stanford, Calif., 1997], 2–3). For this reason, John Winthrop’s eldest son,  John Winthrop, Jr., practiced alchemy because its riches could “fund the social amelioration many As tensions emerged at the intersection of local needs, illicit commerce,  godly governance, and imperial administration, Winthrop and other colonial  Puritan leaders attentively followed the dramatic rift between their brethren  and the Stuart crown in England. The English Revolution was the culmination  of persistent challenges to the Stuarts’ repeated attempts to extend their royal  prerogative. The civil law and Admiralty jurisdiction had been under attack  during the early seventeenth century, primarily by jurist Sir Edward Coke.  Coke believed the true source of English law was popular custom, not foreign  codes. He defended the Admiralty’s right to try cases of high seas piracy but  denied it the right to try arguments over the goods taken by pirates and lim- ited the court’s jurisdiction over those on land charged with aiding and abet- ting piracy.62 Although he toed the Anglican party line, Coke sympathized  with Puritans, gradually becoming a leader against Charles I’s attempts to im- pose royal prerogative. His profound faith in the common law relied upon the  power and sanctity of the jury, which took on a greater degree of significance  for Dissenting Protestants during the Civil War. Religious radicals challenged  the legal system as serving the avaricious and corrupt. They denounced the  death penalty for theft and believed judges should be elected. In 1650, Oliver  Cromwell said, “The law as it is now constituted serves only to maintain the  lawyers and to encourage the rich to oppress the poor.” He argued against  judges, since one could “Take a cobbler from his seat, or a butcher from his  shop, or any other tradesman that is an honest and just man, and let him hear  the case.” The leveling tendencies of the 1640s and 1650s manifested in an ap- peal for greater local legal autonomy.63
 The effect of the revolution’s radicalism on maritime regulation was best  exemplified in the little colony of Rhode Island. In 1644, as governor in chief  of the colonies, the earl of Warwick provided Roger Williams the grant for the  Providence Plantations that would become Rhode Island. Williams intended  the colony to serve as a refuge for religious dissenters of all sorts, particu- larly individuals who would not follow the religious orthodoxy of its northern  neighbor. Many associated radical Protestantism with pirates, since both ex- hibited self- determining behavior. Williams called his creation the “banished”  colony, admitting that his “outcast state” was “hated by the other Colonies.”  Among the progenitors in what would become one of the most notorious  English pirate nests were antinomians; their adherents, including Massachu- setts Bay Colony exile Anne Hutchinson, claimed that their personal relation- ship with God raised them not only above ecclesiastical laws but also above  civil laws and governmental structures. As early as 1651, outsiders feared that  “notorius Delinkquents” would soon rule Newport, the “Cittey of Refuge.”65
 Respectable planter Morgan also found religion, only not the militant Puri- tanism that inspired the earl of Warwick. Instead, he found solace in the state  religion, in an attempt to connect more closely to the metropolitan gentry in  London and to appear less peripheral. He helped pay for the construction of  a new Anglican church in Port Royal. Its first sermon was “Published at the  Request of Sir Henry Morgan,” providing the “opportunity of publishing to  the World, how great a Patron of the Orthodox Religion we have in Jamaica.”  Soon after, Morgan had another sermon printed in London that demon- strated the loyalty of the Jamaica elite. Here the minister implored, “Render  therefore unto Caesar, the things which are Caesars,” and, in turn, “Love the  Magistrate.” Good Christians were not “Trumpeters of Sedition” or “Affectors  of Liberty.” Morgan’s party soon showed intolerance. In 1683, his ally, a lawyer  named Elletson, who had allegedly fled to Jamaica “by his crimes and other  necessities,” tried to convince the council to pass a law against Dissenters but  failed. Sir Thomas Lynch opined, “Though [Elletson] would now be thought  episcopal, he was a fanatic.”59
 traders. Whigs argued that monopolies represented absolutism, the royal pre- rogative, and popery.10
 Despite his success in writing a bill that would markedly transform the ad- ministration of the English empire, Randolph had serious reservations. First,  he feared that local colonial authorities would attempt to use their charters  to bar the vice-admiralty courts. Sir John Trevor, the attorney general, initially  rebuffed these fears, maintaining the crown’s right to establish its own courts  in any colony, even private ones. Randolph knew that such a terse dismissal  ignored the long- standing reality of colonial resistance to crown authority.  He warned the House of Lords that private initiative in early colonization  had served its purpose, but now those very same colonies were attempting “to  break loose and set up for themselves.” Governors supported piracy because 15.

 nated by dissenters. They saw the piracy problem as symptomatic of a con- spiracy against the Navigation Acts, crown prerogative, and even the state  church. Their voluminous letters crossed the Atlantic back to the BOT, depict- ing not merely corruption and crime but also independent factions of radical  religious (Quaker) and political (Jacobite or Scottish) dissenters. Their letters  are prominent in the archival records. The earl of Bellomont wrote detailed  correspondences back to the BOT, going so far as to compose long, introduc- tory letters with citations to additional material, requiring a table of contents.  He included proclamations he had printed in the colonies, depositions, coun- cil minutes, and detailed receipts of pirate booty. If piracy flourished in part  because its supporters avoided communication with English administrators,  these men flooded Whitehall with paperwork.12
 12. Carla Gardina Pestana argues that the Church of England lost much of its coercive power  after the Glorious Revolution. She states, “This apparent diminution rejuvenated the church’s  missionary impulse,” inspiring colonial Anglicans to focus on converting “Britons rather than  Africans or Indians” (Pestana, Protestant Empire: Religion and the Making of the British Atlantic  World [Philadelphia, 2009], 159). On the rising Anglican missionary impulse, see Travis Glasson,  Mastering Christianity: Missionary Anglicanism and Slavery in the Atlantic World (Oxford, 2012).  Jeremiah Basse had been an Anabaptist minister before he went to England as an agent for West  Jersey in 1692. He quit the Baptists at some point and joined Saint Mary’s Protestant Episcopal  Church in Burlington; see “Commission from the Members of the West Jersey Society in England,  to Jeremiah Basse as Their Agent” (1692), in New Jersey Docs., II, 91–92. For eclectic examples of  Bellomont’s thoroughness, see CO 5/1040, 5/1041, and 5/1042.
 Quakers, in particular, raised suspicions, since royalists found pirates in  nearly every Quaker- dominated colony, including Pennsylvania, East and  West New Jersey, and Rhode Island. Quakers largely settled in private colo- nies because religious toleration was always a chief marketing tool for entic- ing prospective colonists across the Atlantic. Even in South Carolina, a colony  not dominated by Quakers, Randolph pointed out Governor John Archdale’s  Quaker beliefs when reporting to the BOT that Archdale had been “well  paid” by Red Sea pirates. Although many Quakers did harbor pirates, royal- ists also tapped into a decades- old tradition of anti- Quakerism. The Society  of Friends was forged in the crucible of the English Revolution’s radical Puri- tanism; they not only represented one of the most ideologically threatening  movements to come out of the war but were also one of the few radical sects  to survive the midcentury crisis, and then thrive in England and the colonies.  Some viewed their reliance upon the Holy Spirit without a written creed or  doctrine as shunning the “safeguard of tradition and the weight of biblical au- thority,” leading to chaos and apostasy. Quakers shed the established church,  had no professional ministers, provided women equal positions, challenged  social norms and hierarchies, uproariously disrupted the services of Angli- riots of twelve or more people a felony if the crowd did not disperse within an hour of the read- ing of the official proclamation, offenders were rarely prosecuted. See Shoemaker, “The London  ‘Mob,’” Journal of British Studies, XXVI (1987), 273–304, esp. 296.
 The Glorious Revolution ushered in an era marked by persistent rumors  of plots and invasions by Jacobites, James II’s supporters. Quakers, in particu- lar, were suspect because Catholic James II was a longtime proponent of reli- gious toleration and a friend of William Penn. Penn had been taken into cus- tody under suspicion of Jacobitism more than once, and a conviction on those  charges would have meant the loss of his property in England and his beloved  colony across the Atlantic. Some connected the Quaker refusal to take oaths  with the support of piracy and crypto- Jacobitism.46
 The pirate hunters were not simply in opposition to Quakers, Scots, and  Jacobites but were often activists for the propagation of the Church of En- gland. Bellomont, Quarry, Randolph, and Nicholson all encouraged the  growth of the Anglican Church in America. George Keith joined the Church 59. J. B., A Letter to a Member of Parliament concerning the Suppression of Piracy (London,  1699/1700).
 of England in 1700 and returned to the colonies working for the Society for  the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (founded in 1698), part of a broader  imperial movement that included the formation of the Society for the Propa- gation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts in 1701.
 whose “unbridled pursuit of personal profit at the expense of the common  good” compelled them to support pirates. After his marriage in 1691, he con- verted to Anglicanism, bringing him into the minority group of colonists who  wished to connect themselves more closely with the metropolis. Morris also  became the first colonial member of the Society for the Propagation of the  Gospel while visiting London in 1701.29
 Quarry begged that Anglicans in particular “may be freed from the tyranny  of the Quakers, who are more inhuman than the Taskmasters of Egypt.” Fully  aware that administrators in England were furious about the colonial support  of piracy, Quarry and his Anglican friends used those allegations to their po- litical advantage against the Quaker regime they found far more treacherous  than mere sea marauders.32

 Dealing with spirits Like India at the same time, early modern England was a society of little societies. The East India Company was founded in a world that had many companies and corporations. The economy of seventeenth-century England was dominated by highly social traders who grouped together to maintain order, protect honour and nurture the habits of interaction that kept commerce going. After Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries, town and city corporations replaced churches at the centre of urban life. Different branches of enterprise were ruled by craft guilds, which allowed independent craftsmen to nurture the ‘mysteries’ of their trade. Even after Henry’s Tudor revolution, the central state had limited control. An array of small corporate bodies was scattered throughout England’s towns and cities. It was these organizations, not the central state, which performed most of the functions of government, keeping the peace, aiding the poor, regulating the economy and supporting commerce. Essential to this system was the free conviviality each association nurtured. As historian Philip J. Stern notes, ‘by its very nature, to “traffic” was not only to truck and barter but to engage in intercourse and exchange’. English society was a commonwealth made up of ‘little platoons’, as Edmund Burke later called them. These were institutions where men (and a handful of women) met to talk and argue, often drunkenly, bound together by common rituals. As a 1695 dictionary put it, the word ‘society’ denoted ‘company, conversation, civil intercourse, fellowship’. England’s companies were not corporations in the way we understand that word today, but social bodies dedicated to nurturing the conviviality necessary to sustain a commercial society.5
 Kaye’s story was an attempt to justify the great crisis by extolling the virtues of its cause. In fact, though, there is little evidence to suggest the East India Company attempted to transform Indian society before 1857; nor is there any evidence that Indians rose up against efforts at reform. Rather, insurgents like Sir Henry Lawrence’s artillery officer fought against the increasingly authoritarian way the British clung to power. The rebellion of 1857–8 was created by Britons’ fearful over-attention to dissent rather than their blithe efforts at reform.3
 This attitude conformed to the spirit of conquering authority which followed the great insurrection throughout the British regime in India. Suspicious of democracy and hostile to unnecessary conversation with the subjects of government, Maine and Stephen were happy to impose laws founded on philosophical principles alien to Indian society where they could. But they also perceived the need to preserve Indian customs where change would be ‘unsafe’, as they put it. More so than earlier generations, Maine and Stephen thought law reflected the character of a civilization, and its imposition on another society was capable of diffusing ‘a new set of moral ideas’. Yet the security of Britain’s power in India always came before any project of moral reform.10
 The new emphasis on a government acting as the voice of a supposedly homogeneous community made those who did not feel part of that ‘single whole’ anxious. New ideas about the state emerged alongside the increasingly centralized management of the organization most likely to run an independent Indian state, the Indian National Congress. In the mid-1930s commentators began to speak of ‘the Congress High Command’, an entity one political scientist called ‘the Leviathan of [the] Indian freedom movement’ associated with ‘just a few individuals or families’. Congress was by far India’s most popular political body, with the support of a majority of voters in most provinces. But its claim to incorporate all Indian communities and act on behalf of everyone was unrealistic; its opponents saw these claims as an instance of tyranny paralleled only by the ‘despotic’ British regime.

  The ideological origins of the British Empire The concept of a British Empire had its roots within the Three Kingdoms of Britain and Ireland; however, to become elaborated in its later, more expansive form, it had to overcome some formidable con- ceptual and practical obstacles. The collision between an Erastian English church and a Presbyterian Scottish kirk obviated the emergence of a pan-British ecclesiology and exacerbated the denominational diver- sity of the British Atlantic world. The British Empire therefore had no unitary theological foundation, though the common Protestantism of the majority of its inhabitants distinguished it sufficiently from the Spanish and French monarchies. Secular political thought defined the community in terms that could accommodate the contiguous territories of a composite monarchy and even encompass an ethnic definition of community that extended to Ireland, but nonetheless proved resistant to imagining colonies and factories as members of the polity before the rise of mercantilist thought in the period after the Restoration. Political economy in turn redefined the nature of British maritime dominion, which under the Stuarts had implied exclusive British imperium solely over home waters; this was replaced by a conception of mare liberum on the oceans which underpinned arguments for the free circulation of trade around the Atlantic world.
 ‘[H]istory devises reason why the lessons of past empire do not apply to ours’, remarked J. A. Hobson in . The objects of his criticism were those nineteenth-century English historians who denied the British Empire any origins or antecedents at all and thereby left it suspended, statically, outside history and beyond the reach of the conventional compulsions of imperial decline and fall (or expansion and overstretch). Hobson accurately diagnosed the fact that most of the major modes within which British history has been written since the nineteenth century had been inhospitable to Imperial history. This was partly the result of the hegemony of English history and historians, for whom England stood proxy for the United Kingdom, and who maintained a willed forgetfulness about the rest of Britain, Ireland and the Empire. Their grand narratives produced an English exceptionalism that sus- tained an insular account of national history and proved increasingly impregnable to the history of the Empire. For example, the historiogra- phy of English religion told the history of the Church in England as the story of the Church of England, a story that might begin with St Augustine of Canterbury, Bede, or at least Wycliffe, but that found its lasting incarnation in the Erastian Church founded under Henry VIII at the English Reformation. That Church had, of course, expanded across the globe to create a worldwide communion, but so had the Dissenting and Nonconformist denominations. The Church of England never became a unified imperial Church, least of all in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the existence of discrete Church establish- ments in Scotland, Ireland and Wales meant that the English Church remained but one ecclesiastical body within a more extensive Anglo- British state (as constituted by the Anglo-Scottish Union of ). Eng- lish ecclesiastical history could thus claim a lengthy pedigree, and even a providential charter for insularity, but it did little to encourage an ampler imperial perspective.

 England, Scotland and Ireland c. – The ‘Edwardian Moment’ of the s saw the birth of the concept of the ‘empire of Great Britain’ (or ‘l’empire de la Grande Bretaigne’); it also saw the beginnings of a Protestant conception of that empire. Henry VIII’s Declaration did not specify any particular religious settle- ment for the proposed union of England and Scotland, though some- time Protestants like John Elder did see English hegemony as a means to accelerate reformation in Scotland. The return to the reformist pro- gramme of Protestantising England under Somerset offered new hope for Scots sympathisers of the English like the Edinburgh merchant James Henrisoun that ‘as these two Realmes should grow into one, so should thei also agre in the concorde & unite of one religion, & the same the pure, syncere & incorrupt religion of Christ’. William Patten, the militantly Protestant judge of the Marshalsea Court who accompanied Somerset’s expedition of , similarly promised the Scots deliverance ‘from the most servile thraldom and bondage under that hideous mon- ster, that venemous aspis and very , the bishop of Rome’. The Greeks, the Russians and other members of the Eastern Church would not submit to his ‘insolent Impery’: why then should the Scots? English intervention in  would in due course help to secure the Scottish Reformation, and ensure the existence of Britain as a Protestant island; however, the enduring differences in theology and church government between the English and the Scottish Churches would render Protes- tantism more of a bone of contention than a bond of union between the two kingdoms.
  The ideological origins of the British Empire of force. Smith’s advice to his son in  to look to the examples of Rome, Carthage and Venice was evidently part of a series of lessons in which Smith had instructed his son in Roman history. His conception of colonies was also only one of his attempts to introduce Roman policy into the respublica Anglorum. He had hoped to create a college of civil law at Cambridge, and a ‘College of Civilians’ to advise the royal council. Smith the civilian and councillor may have been responsible for the notorious Vagrancy Act of  ( Edw. , c. ) which imposed slavery for able-bodied indigents who refused to work, in imitation of the provision in the Corpus Iuris Civilis (XI. xxvi) condemning free-born beggars to the forced labour of a ‘perpetual colonate’ (colonatu perpetuo). His De Republica Anglorum analysed the English commonwealth as a mixed monarchy with descriptive categories drawn from Aristotle, Cicero, and Roman civil law, in order to distinguish England from the countries of the civil law world. In the Discourse of the Commonweal, Smith had in passing called England ‘this empire’, and in De Republica Anglorum he referred to it as ‘great Brittaine, which is nowe called England’. ‘Edward College’ came to naught; the Vagrancy Act was never enforced but rapidly repealed; Smith’s colonies in the Ards collapsed in the face of resistance from the Irish and opposition from the Lord Deputy Sir William Fitzwilliam. Yet, despite his promotion of the Roman model of coloni in Ireland, and his conception of England as a new Rome for its civilising mission, Smith firmly portrayed England ‘not in that sort as Plato made his common wealth . . . nor as Syr Thomas More his Utopia feigned common wealths’, but as it was on  March : the respublica Anglorum, not an Imperium Britannorum. There was no necessary connection between humanism and humani- tarianism. However, classical humanism, of the kind practised by Smith, Cecil and many of the mid-sixteenth-century proponents of Anglo-Scottish union, did transmit important assumptions regarding the superiority of civility over barbarism and the necessity for civilised  Lisa Jardine, ‘Mastering the Uncouth: Gabriel Harvey, Edmund Spenser and the English Experience in Ireland’, in John Henry and Sarah Hutton (eds.), New Perspectives on Renaissance Thought: Essays in the History of Science, Education and Philosophy in Memory of Charles B.

Ochiltree imprisoned Island chiefs, appointed outside commis- sioners, and demanded strategies to civilise the Islands. The Statutes of Icolmkill () legislated for such strategies, which were designed to restore decayed religion, encourage hospitality, discourage idleness, begging, drunkenness and the keeping of firearms, and thereby to remedy the ‘grite crueltie and inhumane barbaritie’, ‘ignorance and incivilitie’ in the Islands, at the expense of the clans’ traditions of sociability and militarism. The origins of Scottish colonial theory and practice in the seven- teenth century lay in internal colonisation within the Stewart realm as James VI of Scotland, later James I of England, continued the pacifica- tion of Gaeldom initiated by his royal ancestors. His presumed suc- cession to the English throne in the s evidently impelled him to greater efforts of ‘civilising’ than might otherwise have been the case, so that internal colonisation provided an emulative bond of union between the two kingdoms.

  The ideological origins of the British Empire   Protestantism and empire: Hakluyt, Purchas and property To plant Christian religion without conquest, will bee hard. Trafficke easily followeth conquest: conquest is not easie. Trafficke without conquest seemeth possible, and not uneasie. What is to be done, is the question. Protestantism should have been the solvent of difference within the Three Kingdoms, and hence the solution to the problem of diversity within the empire of Great Britain. The English proponents of Anglo- Scottish union in the s, and their Scottish agents, argued that together the two kingdoms of England and Scotland could be joined to create a single Protestant island. The imposition of a post-Reformation conception of an Anglo-British empire could thereby extend the process of the Anglo-Welsh union to join another partly Celtic dominion to the English state, and thus form an insular bulwark against Roman Ca- tholicism. Similarly, the New English settlers in Ireland argued from the s that the extension of Protestantism could secure Ireland against invasion and even bring the Kingdom of Ireland into an archipelagic Protestant triumvirate. The integrative force of Protestantism could potentially serve as the bond of union between the civilised inhabitants of the Three Kingdoms to create a uniquely post-Reformation territorial and jurisdictional empire.
 The judgments of later historians have followed the contours of these arguments for Protestant integration, as the ideological origins of Eng- lish nationalism, British nationhood and, in turn, British imperialism have all been traced back to the Protestant Reformations in England and Scotland. According to one recent student of primordial English  Richard Hakluyt the elder, ‘Inducements to the Liking of the Voyage Intended Towards Virginia’ (), in The Original Writings and Correspondence of the Two Richard Hakluyts, ed. E. G. R. Taylor,  vols. (London, ), , .
  nationalism, Protestantism in the sixteenth century was ‘perhaps the most significant among the factors that furthered the development of English national consciousness’. The obvious failure to unite the Three Kingdoms around a consensual version of Protestantism left the devel- opment of a broader British national identity as a task for the eighteenth century: in this period, ‘Great Britain might be made up of three separate nations, but under God it could also be one, united nation . . . Protestantism was the foundation that made the invention of Great Britain possible.’ Looking back from this period to discern the origins of the eighteenth-century British Empire, ‘Christian providentialism’ has been identified as ‘the ideological taproot of British Imperialism’. Protestantism therefore provided Englishness, Britishness and the Brit- ish Empire with a common chronology and a history stretching from the English and Scottish Reformations, through the attempted religious unification of the Stuart monarchies during the seventeenth century, across the Anglo-Scottish Parliamentary Union of  and on to the United Kingdom of Great Britain that sat at the heart of the expanding British empire-state of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. That chronology was hardly continuous, nor the history seamless and unin- terrupted; nonetheless, Protestantism was the only thread joining these three mutually constitutive processes from state-formation to empire- building.
 The two greatest memorialists in English of overseas enterprise, Richard Hakluyt the younger and Samuel Purchas, provide ample material for testing the hypothetical relationship between Protestantism and the ideological origins of the British Empire. As the bishop of Peterborough, White Kennett, noted with pride in , ‘Mr.  and Mr.  (both Clergymen of the Church of England)’ were indispensable providers of information and inspiration for the library he had assembled under the auspices of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Hakluyt – the rector of Wetheringsett in Norfolk, preben- dary of Bristol Cathedral and archdeacon of Westminster Abbey – and Purchas – vicar of Eastwood, chaplain to archbishop George Abbot, rector of St Martin’s, Ludgate, and of All Hallows, Bread Street – were also not alone, of course, among the host of English Protestant clerics who chronicled and promoted trade, colonisation and conquest in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. For example, George Benson, Patrick Copland, Richard Crakanthorpe, William Crashaw, John Donne, Robert Gray and William Symonds all wrote on behalf of the Virginia Company, and deployed sermons as one of the major genres of promotional literature for the company. Moreover, the most penetrating treatments of the question of English property rights in North America came in the writings of the Rev. John White of Dorches- ter and the Puritan leader John Winthrop. John Locke later expanded upon such arguments, as he carefully distinguished between scriptural  [White Kennett,] Bibliothecæ Americanæ Primordiæ (London, ), xii.  D. B. Quinn (ed.), The Hakluyt Handbook,  vols. (London, ); L. E. Pennington (ed.), The Purchas Handbook: Studies of the Life, Times and Writings of Samuel Purchas –,  vols. (London, ).
 The British Empire was nevertheless obviously a post-Reformation empire, even in the territorial and dynastic sense examined in the last chapter. ‘Between the opening ages of Spanish and British transatlantic colonization’, J. H. Elliott has noted, ‘fell the great divide of the Protes- tant Reformation’. In particular, the institutional structure of the later British Empire embodied the English and Scottish Reformations’ chal- lenges to the universalist claims of the Roman Church. In the long run, this made the British Empire institutionally weaker, more flexible, but also finally more fragile than the Spanish Monarchy in the Indies, for example. Ecclesiological dissension racked the Church of England and doctrinal Protestantism penetrated unevenly throughout the English territories. The English Crown recognised a Presbyterian established Church in the Channel Islands after , even when it was most ferociously attacking Presbyterianism within the English Church. England after the Elizabethan Settlement and Scotland after its Refor- mation remained ecclesiologically distinct after –, the one Epis- copalian, the other Presbyterian; the pluralism of the Stuart composite monarchy after  was likewise transmitted to its overseas possessions. By the s, the Elizabethan state also effectively tolerated a powerful Catholic minority (so long as they remained quiescent). Such pluralism and de facto toleration of diversity can help explain the entrenchment of ecclesiological diversity that characterised the British Atlantic Empire, especially since it was enshrined in fundamental law by the Treaty of Union in , which recognised the perpetual separation of the estab- lished Churches of England and Scotland. One major consequence for the later British Empire of the Protestant Reformations was therefore  J. H. Elliott, ‘Empire and State in British and Spanish America,’ in Serge Gruzinski and Nathan Wachtel (eds.), Le Nouveau Monde – mondes nouveaux: l’expérience américaine (Paris, ), .
 Protestantism and empire: Hakluyt, Purchas and property disunity rather than unity. The common Protestantism of the Empire was not based on any shared conception of doctrines of salvation, the church or of Jesus’s divinity. Instead, and increasingly, it depended upon a common anti-Catholicism that was more negative in content than affirmative in structure. Despite these obvious cracks in the facade of a common Protestant- ism, history could be used to provide a continuous religious tradition for the Empire. The traditional genealogy of the British Empire located its beginnings in the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I of England (though not of James VI of Scotland). It was in this period that England – which was assumed to be the primary and only seat of empire in Britain – extended its commerce westwards across the Atlantic, began to send settlers across the ocean and planted its first colonies and, with them, laid the foundations of a British Empire. This chronology affirmed the defining Protestantism of the British Empire by aligning its origins with the period of the consolidation of the English Reformation in the wake of the Elizabethan Settlement. Yet it also tended to displace the Scottish contribution to the origins of a comprehensively British Empire by assuming that the driving force behind both Protestantism and empire came from England alone. Just as Scotland after  had become subsumed into an Anglo-British state, this narrative implied, so it could have made no contribution to the formation of the British Empire, nor could there have been any relationship between the multiple monarchy of the regal union (–) and the British Empire. Richard Hakluyt, in particular, provided a useful resource for this simplifying narrative, not least because he betrayed no interest at all in the British problem of the relations between the Three Kingdoms. One reason for the oblivion into which Samuel Purchas fell may indeed have been his own commit- ment to the projects of British federalism and, later, British unionism in the reigns of James VI and I and Charles I. It was always easier to assume that Anglican Protestantism defined an Anglo-British Empire, centred on London and superintended by London’s bishop. To accept the diversity of the British kingdoms, or even the United Kingdom after , would have been to admit a crucial fissure in the religious charac- ter of the Empire. In this context, Hakluyt’s merely English accounts served the ideological purposes of the later British Empire better than Purchas’s.
  The ideological origins of the British Empire The historical narrative of the Elizabethan, and hence English, ori- gins of the British Empire necessarily effaced the ideological origins of that empire in the period between Reformations. As we have seen, the concept of an ‘Empire of Great Britain’ first emerged in the aftermath of the English Reformation, in the context of Anglo-Scottish relations. It therefore preceded the coincident crises of British Protestantism in – that reaffirmed the Protestantism of the English state in the first year of Elizabeth’s reign and asserted the Protestantism of the Scottish Church by means of insurrection and coup d’état during the Scottish Reformation of . These crises created two unstable and potentially short-lived Protestant monarchies in Britain that with hind- sight appeared as the harbingers of unification, as indeed some of the supporters of Reformation in both England and Scotland during this period hoped. As F. W. Maitland famously put it, ‘[a] new nation, a British nation, was in the making’ in the aftermath of . That nation was decidedly Protestant and incipiently British with a glorious, global destiny ahead of it: ‘The fate of the Protestant Reformation was being decided, and the creed of unborn millions in undiscovered lands was being determined’. If Protestantism was the bond of Britishness, and out of British nationhood sprang British imperialism, the Reformation should logi- cally have been the ideological forcing-house for the British Empire itself. The British religious crises of – may have created two Protestant kingdoms, and hence a Protestant island of Britain; however, they did not produce a common Protestantism, nor could they thereby have provided a mutual foundation for a Protestant empire beyond the Three Kingdoms. ‘The great success of Anglo-Scottish Protestant cul- ture in promoting a measure of cultural integration between the two realms was deeply deceptive’, because England and Scotland retained their particular religious and political institutions, and remained in more respects divided by Protestantism than united by it. Even the contemporary perception that Protestantism united England and Scot- land, and distinguished them from their Catholic neighbours and adver- saries, was undercut by the persistent institutional divergence between the two kingdoms. As the versatile poet and governor of Newfoundland,  F. W. Maitland, ‘The Anglican Settlement and the Scottish Reformation’, in A. W. Ward, G. W.
 Protestantism and empire: Hakluyt, Purchas and property Empire as specifically Protestant, just as it became necessary to define those origins as exclusively English, rather than collectively British.
 Hakluyt’s English nationalism (if such it was) may therefore have owed more to his classicism than to his Protestantism. The evangelical success of the Catholic monarchies in the New World confirmed his lack of confidence in God’s particular favour for England, the most belated of all European powers in its attempts at American colonisa- tion. Hakluyt’s solution to overcome such belatedness lay in informa- tion disseminated through editions. The inspiration and the technical models for those editions came from classical and contemporary ge- ography, particularly Ptolemy, Abraham Ortelius and the ‘perfect’ history of Lancelot de la Popeliniére, whose L’Amiral de France () appeared while Hakluyt was in Paris. Ptolemy encouraged the history of travel (Peregrinationis historia) as the alternative to ‘universall cosmog- raphie’; Ortelius urged the combination of time and space to create geographical histories; and La Popeliniére added exhortations for national enterprise to such geographical history. Hakluyt in turn produced a Latin edition of Peter Martyr’s Decades de Orbe Novo () in Paris, and experimented with adding chronology to geography in that edition as the prelude to his two collections of travels in the Principal Navigations.
 Far from exulting in God’s special favour for England, Hakluyt pointed to God’s greater care for the Catholic monarchies. The belated- ness of the English in the competition for American colonies was a sign to sixteenth-century English Protestants, at least, that Providence had offered Protestants no privileges. It was often recalled – albeit mistaken- ly – that Bartolomé Colon, Christopher Columbus’s brother, had of- fered Henry VII the chance to sponsor a voyage in search of the Indies; the English king rejected the opportunity, which was taken up instead by the Castilian Crown. Hakluyt included two documents in the Principal Navigations recording Colon’s proposal, but drew from the episode the unsettling conclusion that ‘God had reserved the sayd offer  Bauckham, Tudor Apocalypse, –; Katherine R.

Olsen, ‘Was John Foxe a Millenarian?’ Journal of Ecclesiastical History,  (), –.
 With hindsight, and from the perspective of the mid-Victorian Angli- canism, Samuel Purchas could be praised alongside Hakluyt as the Protestant co-founder of a commercial empire: Purchas . . . carried on most effectively . . . the work which Hakluyt had so well begun; and to those two clergymen of the Church of England every one who would desire to see the earliest steps by which the commercial greatness of this nation has been attained must ever turn with gratitude. However, attention to Hakluyt and Purchas’s differing conceptions of Britain, national election, anti-Catholicism, and eschatology prevents any facile assimilation of their respective projects. Purchas’s geographi- cal histories, unlike Hakluyt’s, placed England firmly in the context of the history of the Three Kingdoms, of Europe, and of a wider world conceived within sacred time. Hakluyt took little interest in Ireland, and none in Scotland; he made only the most glancing references to the schemes of church history; and he presented no apocalyptic justification for English trade and settlement. In contrast, Purchas’s attention to the Three Kingdoms of the Stuart multiple monarchy, his cosmopolitan historiography and his attempt to place British history within the wider schemes of theological time made his works strictly incomparable to Hakluyt’s. For all their superficial similarities as memorialists of English overseas enterprise, and in spite of Purchas’s acknowledged debt to his predecessor, their conceptions of Britain, of empire, of history and time distinguished Hakluyt and Purchas sharply from one another. They were linked most directly by their common effort to provide a natural jurisprudential account of the legitimacy of English trade, conquest and plantation, particularly in the Americas, as we shall see; however, even  James S.

 Purchas in turn subsumed the Stuart kingdoms within a more cosmo- politan vision of Europe, defined culturally and religiously. He at- tributed Europe’s primacy over the rest of the world in ‘Men, Arts, [and] Armes’ to its peoples’ possession and exploitation of the nova reperta: stirrups, guns, the compass and long-distance navigation. These were the features of a common European enterprise, shared by the Spanish, the Portuguese, the French and the British in their commercial and colonial activities: ‘Nature hath yeelded herself to Europaean Industry’, just as the Americas were ‘almost every where admitting Europaean colonies’. Yet Christianity – even, and perhaps particularly the divided Christendom bequeathed by the Reformation – was the fundamental marker of European distinction, and the guarantee of Europe’s special place within sacred history: ‘Here are [God’s] Scrip- tures, Oratories, Sacraments, Ministers, Mysteries. Here that Mysticall Babylon, and that Papacie (if that bee any glory) which challengeth both the Bishopricke and Empire of the World; and here the victory over that Beast (this indeed is glory) by Christian Reformation according to the Scriptures.’ This conception of European Christendom was neither triumphalist nor optimistic. Instead, Purchas’s researches into the relig- ions of the world, contained in Purchas His Pilgrimage and Purchas His Pilgrim, convinced him that Christianity was in retreat compared to Islam: ‘it is (in comparison) but a small part of the world, that soundeth the sacred name of ’. The prospects for Christian renewal were bleak so long as Christendom remained divided, and the Papacy powerful: ‘so little a part of the World in name Christian! and so little not covered over . . . with Antichristian Heresie!’ Protestants in general might be the saving remnant within a contract- ing Christendom, but British Protestants had no special election among them, and were as embattled as any. In the face of a Catholic league, and in the knowledge that Christendom as a whole was contracting, it was essential to maintain a common front among Protestants, and even to recognise the commonalities among all members of the Catholic Christian Church, whether Roman or otherwise. In pursuit of the first  Purchas, Hakluytus Posthumus, , –; Denys Hay, Europe: The Emergence of an Idea, nd edn (Edinburgh, ), –.

However, it was far from unreflective and depended instead upon originally Thomist anti-papal (and anti-Lutheran) arguments that could be turned as easily against Protestants as Roman Catholics, in pursuit of conformity at home and legitimate rights of possession abroad.
 Apprehensions of the eschatological significance of British settlement remained largely distinct from justifications for possession or sover- eignty. The most important early seventeenth-century English millen- arian, Joseph Mede, speculated in his Clavis Apocalyptica () that the armies of Gog and Magog of Revelation :– would rise up from ‘the Hemisphere against us’, that is, from the Americas. When an anxious clerical correspondent, William Twisse, asked Mede whether the New World, lately revealed by providence, would be the New Jerusalem or Gog and Magog, Mede replied to the query by distinguishing between the legitimacy of the plantations and their place in sacred time: ‘Con- cerning our Plantation in the American world, I wish them as well as any body; though I differ from them far, both in other things, and in the grounds they go upon.’ Mede expressed little hope that the native peoples could be converted to Christianity, not least because he thought them a colony of Satan’s choosing, brought from the north into Amer- ica. It would be appropriate to ‘affront’ Satan in North America by planting Protestants, but this in itself could not provide adequate ‘grounds’ for the English colonies to ‘go upon’. Even those, like the Dorchester patriarch, John White, who did identify the New World as a place to ‘raise a bulworke against ye kingdom of antichrist wch ye Jesuits labour to rere in all parts of ye world’, did not suggest that the English Church alone had an exclusive mission: ‘the church since christs tyme is to be considered universall without respect of countrey’. To remove to New England would not therefore be a desertion of the English Church, but rather the edification of one ‘particular church’ as a branch of the church universal. However justifiable such an action might be in  Joseph Mede, The Works of the Pious and Profoundly-Learned Joseph Mede, B.D.

  The ideological origins of the British Empire works to a conception of the British Empire as a millennial vehicle or even as a community defined by any precise definition of Protestantism. Finally, the eclectic use of the Bible, as much as the impossibility of finding any specifically Protestant justifications for migration and settle- ment, provided only common Christian justifications for British colon- isation. In sum, there were no identifiably and exclusively Protestant origins of British imperial ideology, and a religious genealogy for the British Empire would not emerge until the early eighteenth century, in the bishop-bibliographer White Kennett’s Bibliothecæ Americanæ Primordiæ (). Britons, as much as Europeans, had to face the disarming fact that their sacred resources, as much as their secular ones, provided no convincing means of squaring the circle by justifying imperium and dominium at the same time, and interdependently. For this reason, the ideological origins of the British Empire remained fissured and unstable as much because of, as in spite of, the contribution of Protestantism.  [Kennett], Bibliothecæ Americanæ Primordiæ, ix, and passim; on Kennett’s enterprise see G.

 The political economy of empire Scots had begun to pursue their own independent colonial ventures, in direct competition with the English and in contravention of the Navi- gation Acts. ‘Fleets and plantations’ would be the alternative to depend- ency within a composite monarchy ruled from London, and hence an economic solution to the inequalities enshrined in the Union of the Crowns. The failure to create a Scottish colonial empire changed the terms of the problem and narrowed the political possibilities until incorporating union seemed the only viable option.

 Temperance Drink was an object of reform as well as a key component of rough homosocial culture. Colonial officials and employers like the Hudson’s Bay Company had always discouraged drinking when it interfered with profit or rule, and the colony witnessed formal anti-drink cam- paigns from 1859 onwards. They were never a roaring success: Jan Noel is correct to argue that the temperance movement in colonial British Columbia made ‘lacklustre progress.’2 But their constant efforts dem- onstrate the range of ways reformers encouraged drink in the interests of reshaping colonial masculinity.
 Other temperance campaigns worked with an explicitly Protestant idiom to rescue settler society from its penchant for drink. Anglican Bishop George Hills remained suspicious about the plebian, suspi- ciously secular tone of anti-drink groups, commenting in his private journal that they fostered ‘lower standards than the true.8 Other Angli- cans were more enthusiastic. At an 1866 Nanaimo meeting, Alexander C. Garrett spun tales of liquor’s ‘disastrous effects attendant on its introduction within the domestic circle – chilling, blighting, and poi- soning wherever allowed ingress, and never satisfied until peace and love industry and self-respect were laid prostrate before it.’9 Methodists particularly embraced the temperance cause. Missionary Cornelius Bryant noted the anniversaries of his temperance pledge in his diary and deemed drink ‘one of the chiefest and most potent agents in this work of the Devil.’10 Methodist-supported temperance meetings in New West- minster and Victoria gathered crowds from across the denominational spectrum, although an 1863 meeting of Nanaimo’s Methodist-influenced Total Abstinence Society rustled up a mere seven pledges.11
 The goals of domesticity, discipline, and sobriety embraced by the YMCA were given new life when reformers in British Columbia turned to what were interchangeably called Mechanics or Literary Institutes. Mechanics Institutes existed throughout the Anglo-American world, offering a path to self-improvement paved with libraries, self-improve- ment classes, and debating societies. In colonial British Columbia, Mechanics Institutes garnered special ideological strength from the perception that they were a compromise between white men’s distaste for religion and love of rough sociability and reformers’ commitment to sobriety, steadiness, and respectability. In 1865 the Vancouver Times mocked the pretention of churchgoers who complained about ‘compul- sory idlers,’ but failed to support practical reform efforts like the Me- chanics Institutes: ‘There is great satisfaction in deploring in loud terms the prevalence of ignorance and sin, in denouncing with much compla- cency the wicked habits of our neighbours, in bemoaning, with sorrow- ful countenances, their social delinquencies, but all this will not mend matters nor afford a substitute for the many temptations to idleness and vice with which our city admittedly abounds. It is far better to super- sede these places of gross and unhallowed pleasures, by giving sub- stantial aid to the establishment of an attractive intellectual resort for compulsory idlers, than to be merely wasting time by whining about the immorality of the Colony.’24 Mechanics Institute thus served the local colonial project by mediating the ongoing conflict between puta- tive social mores and popular culture.
 Missions to White Men Encouraging rough fellows to become disciplined, sober, and steady was a goal shared by Anglican and Methodist missions. Since their arrival in the early 1850s, Protestants and Roman Catholics promoted a variety of social goals consistent with a larger program of piety and white supremacy. After 1858 and 1859 both Anglicans and Methodists identified settler men, especially gold miners, as a special object of their ministrations. Missionaries hoped to ensure that white men severed from traditional social restraints would be provided with new but similarly effective ones. Reverend William Burton Crickmer visually represented these efforts when he sketched himself preaching, a lone voice for Christianity perched on an old barrel among the racially Crickmer’s mission to men.
 Confusion compounded expense and inaccessibility. British Colum- bia’s colonial legislatures had considerable difficulties developing a uniform system of legitimating, registering, and conducting marriage. It was, at various points, unclear if dissenting ministers could perform a marriage, whether weddings had to be held in church, what were allowable hours for marriages, and who would benefit from the licence fees.6 R.C. Lundin Brown, Anglican missionary to Lillooet, lectured the government on their administrative deficiencies when it came to mar- riages. Problems, he explained, flowed from ‘the ignorance of clergy & everybody as to the marriage law in the force in the Colony ... and to mismanagement in response of your officials, which causes & has caused many vexatious & tedious delays.’7
 Critics of the colony’s marriage system promised that reforming it would not only address inefficiency, but lead Aboriginal-white couples to the registry office. Efforts to develop a uniform and accessible form of civil marriage were probably motivated by the mid-nineteenth- century retreat of sexual nonconformity and the increasing hegemony of legal marriage in Britain so ably analysed by John Gillis.8 Yet they also gained additional strength from the local perception that mixed- race relationships were a special threat to the colonial project. In 1862 Anglican Bishop George Hills wrote to British Columbia Attorney Gen- eral Henry Crease arguing that the ideal law should maintain the Christian sacrament of marriage, while providing for ‘the convenience of those who cannot be married by Xian rites through one of the parties being heathen, but also may desire to live in legal not in illegal cohabi- tation for the sake of the offspring and morality.’9
 Legislation passed in 1865 and extended to Vancouver Island in 1867 reflected these specifically racial and broadly social goals. ‘An Ordi- nance respecting Marriage in British Columbia’ allowed dissenting clergy to wed, empowered secular, government-appointed ‘registrars’ to conduct civil weddings, loosened the restrictions on the place of marriage, and removed the necessity of parental consent for underage girls whose guardians were overseas.10 While the bill initially specified a five-dollar registration fee, this was later deemed inimical to the goals of the legislation and eliminated. One legislator claimed that ‘there should be no impediment whatever thrown in the way of marriages in the colony.’11
 When metropolitan feminists searched the globe for colonial realms where white women could acquire independence and rights, they soon looked to British Columbia. In London, the colony received a good deal of popular press in the late 1850s and early 1860s and acquired a small but influential cabal of boosters with significant ties to reform and missionary circles. It was this group that came together in February 1862 to sanction the creation of the Columbia Emigration Society (CES), an offshoot of the Anglican Columbia Mission ‘founded in the first instance to facilitate the Emigration of Industrious Women to the Colony of British Columbia.’40 Overseen by the Lord Mayor of London, the founding meeting of the CES represented a substantial block of improv- ing, Evangelical, bourgeois circles, and garnered a substantial amount of attention in both metropole and periphery.41 Here is a fine example of what Burton dubs the imperial public sphere, that ‘imagined and contested space where unseen communities were drawn together through a shared public spectacle that transcended boundaries of “Home” and “Away” precisely because it brought colonial “domestic” matters directly to the sightline of metropolitan readers.’42
 This history of agitation did not prepare Victoria’s elite for the inau- guration of the long-sought-after immigration. ‘This London “Colum- bia Mission Meeting” has taken us quite by surprise,’ wrote New Westminster missionary H.P. Wright in a private letter to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts in April 1862. While he had told metropolitan friends of British Columbia’s desire for white female immigrants, he expected neither the pace nor the form that the emigration took. ‘The Bishop is as much puzzled as I am,’ Wright added.63 It was not until June that a ‘local committee’ was formed in Victoria to cooperate with CES. This committee looked much like the other manifestations of the local, improving elite, constituted, as it was, by a potent mix of Anglican clergy, improving businessmen, colonial officials, and naval officers.64 Yet communication between London and Victoria remained limited and unclear, and efforts to form a committee on the Mainland failed altogether.65

 So relief at the fall of King James and the triumph of the Dutch Protestant William of Orange in 1688 was overwhelming. As soon as news of the Glorious Revolution arrived in New England, Boston led the way with a band of rebels seizing the royal governor and dissolving the hated Dominion. Yet at the same time as the colony revived its old forms of self-government, Boston developed a novel sense of fealty towards the Crown after all those decades of hostility towards the Stuarts. With King William III on the throne, Boston’s Puritans finally felt there was a godly monarch culturally attuned to New England’s religious and political ethos. That sense of divergence from England, which had marked out the foundation of Massachusetts in the 1630s, began to ebb as the spiritual and political interests of Crown and colony aligned. Increasingly, the evangelical leaders of late seventeenth-century Boston could see themselves as part of a shared, global endeavour to resist popery, protect true religion and promote English liberty alongside their Protestant monarch. In reality, William III would continue with much of the Stuarts’ policy of centralizing control over the American colonies: the rewritten Massachusetts charter of 1691 shifted the franchise qualification from church membership to property holding and kept the governorship a Crown appointment. Inevitably, this created the risk of a clash between the royal prerogative of the governor (usually, a former British army officer) and the autonomy of the Massachusetts House of Representatives (elected by male colonists since 1629), but at the turn of the eighteenth century such tensions were non-existent. The remarkable, natural sympathy which sprang up between elites in Massachusetts and the mother country – shared beliefs in the liberties of Magna Carta, the terrifying spectre of French and Spanish Catholicism, the wretchedness of the Stuarts and the virtues of the 1688 constitutional settlement – overshadowed any theoretical constitutional incompatibility. For now, Boston was delighted to be a part of Britain’s emergent, Atlantic empire.22
 Barbados was called by settlers and colonial officials alike ‘little England’. The most easterly of the Caribbean islands, it was among the first to be colonized and long held its own as an imperial pace-setter. It was ‘the mother colony, the centre to which newly-formed colonies looked for labour, experienced planters, capital, and leadership in matters of imperial politics and trade’.6 The Englishness of the island – its cathedrals, parliament, parishes, cricket pitches, garrisons and gardens – would become a source of intense pride. ‘On no one of our foreign possessions is the print of England’s foot more strongly impressed than on Barbados,’ wrote the nineteenth-century historian J. A. Froude. ‘It has been ours for two centuries and three-quarters, and was organized from the first on English traditional lines, with its constitution, its parishes and parish churches and churchwardens, and schools and parsons, all on the old model; which the unprogressive inhabitants have been wise enough to leave undisturbed.’7
 At work as well as in play, Somerset oversaw the steady Anglicization of Cape culture. In 1812, the Latin School in Cape Town was instructed by Government House ‘to promote and establish the cultivation of the English language to the greatest extent among your pupils of the highest rank, as the foundation upon which they will in their future life best make their way’. Somerset took the policy further by replacing Dutch teachers ‘by Englishmen of a superior class, as affording both the best means of making the English language more general in the Colony and improving the manners and morals of the people’. In official documentation, English took over from Dutch, and British jurisprudence subsumed Dutch law as the colony’s legal system. In matters spiritual, Scottish Calvinist ministers started to assume the ministries at Dutch Reformed churches, and Anglican services became the norm. Increasingly frozen out of law, politics and business, Cape Town’s original Dutch residents became progressively disillusioned and resentful of British rule – so much so that many allied themselves with the Boer farmers to join the Great Trek northward in the 1830s out of the Cape Colony and into the Transvaal.73
 Such extravagant, ornamental regard for the display and rituals of power was elemental to Wellesley’s Empire. He believed in awing his Indian subjects with ceremony and, like Cornwallis, instilling some sense of civic discipline into Calcutta’s dissolute ruling class. ‘I am resolved to encounter the task of effecting a thorough reform in private manners,’ Wellesley had written to the British foreign secretary, Lord Grenville, upon his arrival in 1798. ‘The effect … has been to compel me to entrench myself within forms and ceremonies, to introduce much state into the whole appearance of my establishments and household to expel all approaches to familiarity, and to exercise my authority with a degree of vigour and strictness nearly amounting to severity.’75 The lax, dissolute Calcutta of William Hickey came under sustained assault from Wellesley’s reformation of manners: extra-marital affairs, interracial liaisons, drinking and gambling and a critical, free press were all now subject to close supervision. In their place, the governor-general promoted a new code of colonial honour based upon the army, the Company and the Anglican church. Morality and pageantry, deference and duty were to provide the templates of colonial Calcutta, and they were all carefully codified in the design and iconography of his greatest architectural legacy to the city: Government House.

 Similar watchnight services were, no doubt, being conducted at a dozen other old Imperial cathedrals and chapels in the nearby time zones. The Archbishops of Auckland and Papua New Guinea, the Bishops of Busan and Kuching, of West Malaysia and Riverina, of Gippsland and Wangaratta, would be leading their flocks in the Nicene Creed and the Eucharist conducted in a variety of languages and accents. In all those churches, though, the congregations would, largely, be locals—Malays or Aussies or pidgin-speaking Papuans: only a few expatriates, businessmen on short term assignment, or diplomats, would be there, sharing in the hymns, listening to the sermon.
 But in Hong Kong the devout were nearly all Britons. A few Christian Cantonese were there, in pews near the west door; but the cathedral looked that night as though it still was peopled by those for whom it was first built—the governing élite of this most distant, most extraordinary colony. The typical colonial family was at every pew, kneeling on red woollen sacks prepared by the Ladies’ Volunteers, reading from prayer books furnished by the British and Foreign Bible Society, gazing up at brass plaques commemorating the passing of the various Governors and Chief Secretaries, Chief Justices and Commissioners who had kept the place ticking over for the century and a half of its colonial existence.
 Empire at the Periphery bridges these two bodies of scholarship that,  on the one hand, explain the rise of British Atlantic colonies within an  empire struggling to fashion its authority institutionally and, on the  other, detail the transnational alliances forged in everyday commerce.  Primarily focusing on the key transformative period in England’s (and  then Britain’s after the Act of Union in 1707) relationship with its colo- nies—the years between 1624 and 1713—this work examines how the  interimperial colonial communities of the seventeenth century shaped  British efforts to create a state-centered and exclusive empire. The Eng- lish Civil War, a regicide, three “revolutions,” and multiple wars with  both the Dutch and French required a bellicose government, and over- whelmingly English state builders realized that it was only by harness- ing the nation’s commercial power (and particularly that of its colonies)  that England could meet these challenges. Simultaneously, this new  state could further encourage and expand colonial development. Never  coherent, sometimes contradictory, and always uneven, seventeenth- century English colonial policy was characterized by the steady efforts  of a constellation of interests including courtiers, Parliament, and the  “new merchants,” to make the Atlantic colonies productive for the rising  English state. Using trade laws, new excises, customs reform, adminis- trative reorganization, the navy, and warfare, English authorities worked  to transform colonies that were used to self-determination into a more  integrated and mercantilist empire.6

 Like many in the service of the British Empire, Thomas Lewin’s involvement in India ran in the family. In 1841, his uncle Lieutenant  William Charles James Lewin, a commissioned officer in the Bengal  Artillery, found himself sitting out his eighth monsoon season since  transferring to the Invalid Establishment at Cherrapunji in the Khasi Hills in 1833. His health still shattered from the rigours of the Anglo-Burmese  War the decade before, Lewin, his wife Jane and their five children could still welcome the Welsh missionaries Thomas and Anne Jones  to share their cramped and damp quarters. Chronically ill and never financially secure enough to return ‘home’ with his family to England, William Lewin died of jungle-fever in 1846. His own career trajectory and ultimate demise was a case study in the flux of circumstance and  sensibility. Lewin had, for example, undergone a spiritual awakening on  his 1822 voyage to India as a young cadet, and on his arrival he read the  Bible every day, a practice that deviated from the desirable affiliations of the soldiery (Anglican, Presbyterian or Catholic) and which isolated  him from his comrades: ‘suspicions began to be entertained that I was  somewhat “methodistical,” and thenceforth I stood alone’.43
 Empire of Hell This revisionist history of convict transportation from Britain and Ireland will challenge much that you thought you knew about religion and penal colonies. Based on original archival sources, it examines arguments by elites in favour and against the practice of transportation and considers why they thought it could be reformed, and, later, why it should be abolished. In this, the first religious history of the anti- transportation campaign, Hilary M. Carey addresses all the colonies and denominations engaged in the debate. Without minimizing the individual horror of transportation, she demonstrates the wide variety of reformist experiments conducted in the Australian penal colonies, as well as the hulks, Bermuda and Gibraltar. She showcases the idealists who fought for more humane conditions for prisoners, as well as the ‘political parsons’, who lobbied to bring transportation to an end. The complex arguments about convict transportation, which were engaged in by bishops, judges, priests, politicians and intellectuals, crossed continents and divided an empire.

 It is time for a complete rethink of the place of religion in the history of convict transportation. Empire of Hell provides this. It poses the radical argument that religious reform was fundamental, not incidental, to con- vict colonization in the British empire. If this was an ‘empire of hell’, it was a hell illuminated by Christian reformers from across the denomin- ational and political spectrum. It takes seriously the motivation of those who supported religious reforms to transportation and seeks to under- stand why they were eclipsed by the end of the transportation era. In the ‘age of reform’, the reform of criminals was a complex idea with deep religious roots. Parliament debated whether the object of punishment was to be retributive, preventative or reformative and sought to reform the law by making it more consistent, rational and efficient. Religious authorities sustained a much higher, inner and transformative view of reformation than the pragmatic civil authorities, or indeed the convicts themselves. Both the latter understood reformation in terms of passive acceptance of authority under sentence, avoidance of reoffending and integrating successfully in colonial society. Hence the paradox that Evan- gelical clergy denounced convict morality even while acknowledging the rising wealth and social standing of emancipists and the usefulness of their own convict servants.12 It was only in response to horror stories from the penal colonies that Christian and secular humanitarians came p. 219. For context see Rodgers, Ireland, Slavery and Anti-Slavery: 1612–1865, p. 293 and Christine Kinealy, A Death-Dealing Famine: The Great Hunger in Ireland (London: Pluto Press, 1997), p. 29.
 The idea that criminals could and should be reformed through work and prayer was a key notion for both utilitarian and Christian idealists at the end of the eighteenth century. However, the focus of the reformers was on the prison system and on the individual criminal – not the practice of transportation. John Howard (1726–1790), a lay Dissenter, was the religious face of the movement, and was instrumental in publi- cizing the deplorable conditions for prisoners throughout Britain and, later, Europe.13 He produced his own designs for gaols and penitentiar- ies and stressed that while hygiene and discipline should have paramount importance, there should be separation of different classes of prisoner, and access to religious services and books: ‘A CHAPEL is necessary to a Gaol. I have chosen for it [on the accompanying plan] what seems to me a proper situation. It should have a gallery for debtors or women; and the rest may be separated below. Bibles and prayer-books should be chained at convenient distances on each side: those who tear or otherwise damage them should be punished.’14 Like most utilitarian reformers, Howard believed prisoners should receive their just punishment, but no more than they deserved, and he had no strong objections to transportation.
 As Howard demonstrated, the rise of the Enlightened prison in the eighteenth century opened the door to more activist, Christian utilitar- ianism. At home and in the empire, the early nineteenth century saw an explosion in missionary and other religious organizations dedicated to philanthropic, educational and medical causes, catering to all the cor- poral and spiritual works of mercy, including work with prisoners and religious instruction. The expansion of the settler British empire facili- tated Protestant colonial missionary societies, such as the Anglican SPG and SPCK or the Scottish SSPCK which provided religious instruction to colonists, and the expansion of Catholic religious orders who worked mainly with the Irish diaspora.20 In 1831, the Sisters of Mercy were founded by Catherine McCauley in Dublin to focus entirely on charit- able work; they would come to play a particularly important role in the British settler colonies.21 The first religious women to come to the penal colony of New South Wales were from another charitable order, the Australia V, Third Letter to Lord Pelham, eds. Tim Causer and Philip Schofield (London: The Bentham Project, 2018).
 21 Colin Barr and Rose Luminiello, ‘‘‘The Leader of the Virgin Choirs of Erin”: St Brigid’s Missionary College, 1883–1914’, in Timothy McMahon, Michael Denie and Paul Sisters of Charity (founded in 1816), four of whom arrived in 1838 at the request of Bishop John Bede Polding (1794–1877) to work with convict women in the Parramatta Female Factory.22 Collaboration rather than hostility between church and state would be the norm for the emerging philanthropic state of Victorian Britain and its settler empire.
 Before this, the Christian monopoly on charitable support for those on the margins of society was challenged by enlightened thinkers who insisted that prisons, hospitals and lunatic asylums should perform a utilitarian function, whether to protect, heal, reform or contain miscre- ants, and deter crime. For secular utilitarian penal reformers, transporta- tion was regarded as a humane, if often inefficient substitute for execution of criminals. The Italian jurist, Cesare Beccaria (1738–1794), whose most celebrated study, Dei delitti e delle pene (Concerning Crimes and Punish- ments) (1764), was published in English in 1767, presented humanitarian arguments against the ‘useless profusion of punishments, which has never made men better’, including the death penalty and torture.23 He denounced the compliant hypocrisy of a church who failed to check unjust authority: ‘every noble a tyrant over the people, and the ministers of the gospel of Christ bathing their hands in blood in the name of the God of all mercy’.24 Yet Beccaria was thoroughly in favour of the practice of transportation as an alternative to execution, which he regarded as a waste of the valuable resource of the prisoner’s labour. He noted that thieves were seldom executed in England since transportation to the [American] colonies was substituted for it and this was also the policy in the Russian Empire. Not only was this a thrifty practice, Beccaria argued that it was reformative for convicts sent both to Siberia and the American colonies, noting: ‘It has not been discovered that crimes multiply in consequence of this humanity.’ In 1837, the Rev. John Dunmore Lang (1799–1978) would cite this passage approvingly when arguing in favour of the continuation of transportation and the creation of new penal colonies against the arguments of Archbishop Richard Whately.25 On transportation, Howard tended to agree with Beccaria. He does not seem to have felt any particular objection to transportation as a punishment – he Townsend (eds.), Ireland in an Imperial World (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 155–178.
 Reformatory penal settlements, like anti-slavery, missions to convert the heathen and humanitarian interventions on behalf of native people formed part of the liberal props that enabled the expansion of the second British Empire.57 In part, the drive to create a moral empire following the loss of the American colonies was a natural extension of the role of the established church in the imperial British state. Across Christendom, the monastery had been the model for penal discipline in Christian states. While most prisoners were male, prisons for ‘fallen’ or criminal women were typically directed by women in religious orders, following monastic modes of governance and supported financially by women’s work such as washing.58 In the penal colony of New South Wales, the Irish Sisters of Charity enlisted to regulate the Parramatta Female Factory were following a long tradition of such deployments in the rare context of transported female prisoners. Magdalen asylums were also run by French 56 For an enumeration of convicts in international convict establishments, with estimates of flows across time, see ‘ConvictVoyages’, www.convictvoyages.org/statistic (Accessed 7 April 2018), and Anderson, ‘Transnational Histories’, 381–397.
 http://www.convictvoyages.org/statistic Sisters of Mercy in Lower Canada,59 where the 1850s saw a steady rise in religious solutions for vulnerable women, juveniles and First Nations prisoners outside the secularized prison complex.60 Catholic and Prot- estant missionaries were employed in all the settler colonies to contain, educate and Christianize Indigenous British subjects, sometimes in carc- eral conditions that resembled those in more overtly secular penal sta- tions. Religious women later conducted missions in northern Australia to Aboriginal lepers housed in lock hospital conditions.61 However, this takes us away from the particular study of British convict transportation, which was not re-introduced in British North America, with the excep- tion of the political prisoners transported for their role in the rebellions of 1836 and 1837. In all cases, religious provision for prisoners was one aspect of the entanglement of church and the British imperial state, initially Protestant but ameliorated by liberal toleration of other creeds.
 A significant feature of British convict transportation was the extent to which it was both tempered and justified by religion. Other European empires also made use of religious personnel and religious ideologies for the management of convict populations, including those sentenced to internal exile or overseas transportation. While all establishments for British and Irish convicts were managed by the state, Protestant soci- eties and Catholic religious orders managed those in other empires, especially for children, women, slaves and ex-slaves, and tribal and indigenous people.62 These include the Salvation Army in British India and, from 1933, French Guiana, where they supported former prison- ers, and schools for convict children in French Guiana and New Cale- donia.63 While not a formal part of the prison system, missions played a significant role in attempts to contain frontier violence, such as those conducted by the London Missionary Society in the warring Kat River Settlement of the Cape Colony.64 Religious offenders, like political 59 Ted McCoy, Hard Time: Reforming the Penitentiary in Nineteenth-Century Canada (Edmonton: Athabasca University Press, 2012), pp. 87–88.
 By the 1970s, revisionist writing by social scientists and historians tore apart liberal assumptions about the progressivism of penal reform. They argued that the creation of the penitentiary was the product of the zeal for social control associated with the rise of industrial society in western Europe and parts of the United States. The classic studies by Michael Ignatieff and Michel Foucault argued that the prison was the material embodiment of the power wielded by ruling elites over the powerless and that breathtaking hypocrisy was the dominant note in religious writing about those convicted and incarcerated.73 Vic Gatrell’s The Hanging Tree provided a mercilessly critical survey of the cupidity and heartlessness of gaol chaplains who served to ‘comfort’ prisoners under sentence of execution,74 but Foucault got there first. For Foucault, the nineteenth century was a period of retreat from the physical punishment of the body to the disciplining and incarceration of the soul, a process conducted by ‘a whole army of technicians who took over from the executioner . . . warders, doctors, chaplains, psychiatrists, educationalists’.75 Chaplains were high on Foucault’s list of surrogates for the executioner. Clergy had always attended executions and used the gallows in an active way to preach repentance to the crowd assembled for public death.76 But while there are religious traditions which celebrate the infliction of both pain and incarceration,77 secular historians tend to regard chaplains as part of the early history of the penitentiary, whose role was rapidly secularized and bureaucratized in the hands of state authorities and subordinated to prison officers, social workers and eventually modern parole and proba- tion officers.78
 One of the central assumptions of the ‘hell-on-earth’ discourse is that penal settlements were devoid of spiritual, moral and intellectual facil- ities and that convicts lacked an internal, religious life. While convicts in the penal settlements displayed scant interest in institutional religion, Hamish Maxwell-Stewart’s work on convict religious tattoos suggests that this was not the whole story.83 The clergy who ministered to convicts have been lampooned as second-raters without sympathy for their charges or the intellect to reflect on their role in maintaining a corrupt system. In the 1960s, C. M. H. Clark derided the Protestant clergy for serving ‘the contemptible, servile, hypocritical function of acting as moral policemen, or sanctimonious spies, for the established moral order’.84
 ‘religious turn’ in historical writing about the penitentiary, including the rediscovery of the religious foundations of early prison reform. The object is not to elevate and celebrate these religious threads – simply to make them visible and integral to the historical tapestry of the convict system. Simon Devereaux, for example, in an article which examines the background to the English Penitentiary Act of 1779, suggests that too much emphasis has been placed on the modernizing, secular and Enlightenment roots of prison reform to the neglect of its weighty, religious elements.90 Penal reform was dominated by Evangelical religion as much as utilitarian sciences, according to Richard Follett.91 When Sir William Blackstone (1723–1780) and William Eden set out to reform the penal code, they proposed the creation of a model penitentiary which would replace the poorly regulated and disease-ridden holding pens that had been condemned by the reforming John Howard with moral reformatories which were designed to bring the prisoner back to a know- ledge of their correct place in society. It is the next stage of the reform process which has been neglected by researchers; for ongoing religious reform we need to turn our attention south. As discussed in Chapter 2, although John Howard’s model penitentiary with the chapel at its heart was never built (and neither was Jeremy Bentham’s Panopticon), Evan- gelical reformist aspirations were invested in the decision to establish a penal colony in New South Wales. It was not until 1816 that the first model penitentiary at Millbank was opened, to almost universal condem- nation. In the 1830s, as Follett has suggested, Evangelicals hoped that their ‘new models of prison discipline’ would lead offenders back to an ordered life which was bounded by lawful and moral citizenry.92 Pace Hughes, the era of convict transportation to Australia belongs to the most optimistic phase of the prison reform movement which continued until the 1850s, during which the British imperial state committed itself to an explicitly reformist project in which religion played a key role. It was not until the end of the transportation era that there was a move away from moral reformism back to old-fashioned deterrence and severity.
 Evangelicals generally opposed transportation and supported moves for home-based penitentiaries, Chapter 3 examines the work of Sir George Arthur who sought to create a reformist penal colony on Evangelical principles in Van Diemen’s Land from 1824 to 1836. Beginning with Arthur but reflecting changes to the management of the prison system in Great Britain and Ireland, clergy began to have an increasing role within the convict system, whether as chaplains, magistrates, religious instructors or schoolteachers. Enshrined in legislation that put them at the heart of the reformative prison movement, their role became more significant after the Bigge Reports (1822–1823) recommended the enhancement of private assignment and harshening the regime of pun- ishment in the colonies. Chapter 4 examines the special role played by the Quakers, Rational Dissenters who initiated the penal reform move- ment in the United States, which was duly brought to Australia by Quakers travelling ‘under concern’, notably James Backhouse and George Washington Walker in the 1830s. Backhouse and Walker rec- ommended that reformation and training was implemented for both convicts and Australian Aborigines but continued to support transpor- tation in the form created by Colonel Arthur.
 Just as religious ideas were essential to the design and reform of penal systems, so they were in the overthrow of convict transportation. Chapter 5 focuses on the Liberal Anglicanism of Richard Whately (1787–1863), archbishop of Dublin, who first articulated a Christian utilitarianism hostile to the continued maintenance of the flow of con- victs and supportive of systematic colonization using free labour. Whately’s arguments were incorporated into the findings of the Moles- worth SC on Transportation (1838), which demonized convicts and their settler masters. Chapter 6 examines the campaign to denounce the ‘horrors of transportation’ and its sectarian strands, represented by the trade in insults between the judge, Sir William Westbrooke Burton (1794–1888), and Ullathorne in New South Wales. Both Catholics and Protestants had reasons to condemn the moral failings of the convicts and free the colony from private assignment, which was regularly, if erroneously, equated with slavery. While Molesworth was sure that his Report had dealt a death blow to transportation, in fact it continued with renewed vigour, buoyed by religious models of reformative transporta- tion promoted by senior members of both Whig and Tory administra- tions. Chapters 7 and 8 examine a number of penal reformatory experiments, of which Captain Maconochie’s term in the ‘Ocean Hell’ of Norfolk Island was the most controversial. The high watermark for religiously based transportation was reached by the probation system, considered in Chapter 9, which attempted to implement the Evangelical straightjacket of Pentonville with a mobile army of religious instructors in the probation stations of Van Diemen’s Land. By the 1840s, no corner of the British penal empire was entirely free of religious and reforming influences, though the attempt to reform the hulks, Bermuda and Gibraltar, considered in Chapter 10, defeated the best efforts of Gov- ernor Sir Charles Elliot (1801–1875) and other administrators.
 It is necessary to demarcate the limits of this study. Except by way of illustration, it is not about convict religion, the relationship between convicts and their pastors or religious elements of convict discipline, though these are important subjects which deserve attention. Rather, it concerns religious arguments made by elites about convict transporta- tion, initially to support its reformative possibilities against the rival claims of the penitentiary (Chapters 2, 3, 4 and 8) and later to demand its abolition (Chapters 5, 6 and 9). While individuals often held strong opinions about transportation, the debate between ecclesiastical and government authorities was at its most active in the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s when the liberal empire provided a vast arena for reformative experiments in penal discipline. This period forms the main focus of study though it includes analysis of every major penal establishment to where British and Irish convicts were transported as well as considering the views of every major Christian denomination that participated in the anti-transportation debate.
 This book argues that religion played a central role in shaping the ideology and discipline of the convict system as it evolved over the course of more than eighty years. Reformist regimes, heavily influenced by religious ideals, were just as important to the convict colonies as they were to home-based British penitentiaries and reformatories. Enlight- ened penal reform was the product of a partnership between religious and secular reformers, including John Howard and other rational Evan- gelicals and Dissenters, Samuel Romilly and even the anti-clerical Jeremy Bentham. When Bentham debated whether his Panopticon or transportation to New South Wales was the best solution for crime in Britain, he was recommending prison reforms which had already been trialled in the United States along lines supported by the Religious Society of Friends. In the nineteenth-century campaign to end convict transportation, Anglican Evangelicals, Liberal Anglicans, Quakers and other advocates of Rational Dissent, as well as Catholics, would play different roles in reforming and then campaigning for an end to convict transportation. The next five chapters will consider how these different religious traditions of penal reform evolved and why it proved so challen- ging for their combined forces to bring down the ‘empire of hell’.
 (William Wilberforce, 1822) Following the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade in 1807, a reforming wave swept through the British Empire. While Mitchel bemoaned the extension of the empire of hell, reformers proposed the establishment of a moral empire which might compensate for the loss of the thirteen American colonies. Although the moral empire was not exclusively or even a majority achievement of clerical or specially religiously committed reformers, it was affected by three related religious movements: Rational Dissent, which included enlightened advocates for penal reform inspired by John Howard; the evangelical revival, especially the serious Anglican interpretation of the movement spearheaded politically by William Wilberforce (1759–1833); and the Methodists with their heightened awareness of the social dimension of Christianity sparked, in some cases, by the expectation of an imminent Second Coming. This chapter will consider the way in which one of those strands, Anglican Evangelicalism, or the ‘low church’ party of the United Church of England and Ireland,3
 3 From this point, Evangelicalism is capitalized to refer to the Anglican Evangelical tradition and put in lowercase when referring to evangelicalism as a wider movement that included most Dissenters (i.e., Baptists, Quakers, Congregationalists and Methodists) as well as some Anglicans. For analysis, see Gareth Atkins, ‘Anglican Evangelicalism’, in Jeremy Gregory (ed.), The Oxford History of Anglicanism, Volume II: Establishment and Empire, 1662–1829 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017), 452–473; David W. Bebbington, Evangelicalism in Modern Britain: A History from the 1730s to the came to influence ideologies of penal discipline at home and how this impacted the penal colonies of New South Wales, including Norfolk Island and Van Diemen’s Land (which became a separate colony in 1825).
 Evangelicals were open to plans for reform though they were initially hostile to convict transportation, which they saw as a less moral solution than the construction of well-designed penitentiaries at home. They hoped that the reformatory regime which underpinned the Gaol Chap- lains Act (1773), which required the appointment of chaplains in every prison, and the Penitentiary Act of 1779, might be extended to the colonies.4 In effect, reformers opted for the creation in Botany Bay of what Mayhew would later call a ‘penal purgatory’.5 While Anglicans did not believe in purgatory, they were open to plans to create an earthy equivalent in the penal colonies.6 Not all colonial officers shared this Evangelical ambition, indeed most governors were pragmatic naval or military men focused on keeping order and doing their duty, not religion. However, it was promoted by a number of the more articulate and influential governors as well as most of the colonial chaplains, and their views were endorsed by the Colonial Office and figures of influence in Parliament. To understand how this happened, we need to know more about the ‘age of atonement’, a period dominated by the Tories in government and the established church in religion, who ruled together from the arrival of the First Fleet in New SouthWales in 1788 until 1830.
 4 For the ideology of the 1779 Penitentiary Act, see Laurie Throness, A Protestant Purgatory: Theological Origins of the Penitentiary Act, 1779 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008); The Gaols Act (1823) mandated regular visits to prisoners by chaplains.
 atonement’ in contrast to the ‘age of enlightenment’ which preceded it.7
 The interpretative shift in understandings of atonement is evident in the Arminian hymns of Charles Wesley (1707–1788), which are particu- larly rich in representations of the atonement and its symbols of lambs, blood, sacrifice, prayer, death and hoped for – but never guaranteed – pleas for pardon and release from bondage (to sin).11 In Hymns and 7 Boyd Hilton, The Age of Atonement (Oxford: Clarendon, 1988). 8 For a study that stresses the fluid political alliances which subverted partisan Anglican boundaries and linked Anglicans with like-minded Dissenters, such as the Quakers and former Quakers who were prominent in prison reform see J. C. D. Clark, ‘Church, Parties and Politics’, in Jeremy Gregory (ed.), The Oxford History of Anglicanism, Volume II: Establishment and Empire, 1662–1829 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017), pp. 289–313.
 Evangelical theology was generally nationalistic and outward looking, rejecting the personal, privatized piety of European pietism and older Dissent and seeking to create a ‘national morality’, uniform and rigorous across social and geographical boundaries.20 Its importance stemmed from the way it was embraced as the core value system by middle-class professionals and intellectuals who made up the ruling class of the British Empire, common to the established Church of England and Ireland and also to the Church of Scotland. William Wilberforce was its parliamen- tary leader, but the Evangelical movement extended much more widely than the ‘Saints’ associated with Wilberforce in Parliament and the ‘Clapham Sect’.21 Today, Wilberforce and the Evangelical circle of influencers are often seen as conservatives (Tories). However, this is misleading: Claphamites were just as likely to regard themselves as Whigs, because this was the party, as James Stephen explained, of ‘Peace, Reform, Economy and Toleration’,22 In their Claphamite garb, early Evangelicals were socially conservative, reflected in their establishment of organizations such as the Sunday School movement (c.1780), the Bettering Society (1797) and the Bible Society (1804). But in other ways they were progressive and outward looking, as evidenced in their work for the colony of Sierra Leone, the Church Missionary Society and the penal colony of New South Wales. It is therefore anachronistic to draw a linear progression between contemporary conservative and liberal political 19 Martin J. Wiener, Reconstructing the Criminal (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), pp. 111–113.
 In relation to penal reform, the major activists were not figures regarded as central to the Clapham Sect but rather Quaker evangelicals (or ‘ex Quakers’), such as Thomas Fowell Buxton (1786–1845), Samuel Hoare (1751–1825), Elizabeth Fry (1780–1845) and William Tallach (1831–1908).24 They allied with Tory defenders of the exclusive rights of the established church, who would later mobilize to defend the reformist experiment of the Millbank Penitentiary, such as the politician George Peter Holford (1767–1839),25 Governor of Millbank Peniten- tiary and the Rev. Daniel Nihil, both of whom advocated reformist prison discipline and opposed transportation.26 Buxton, though ‘heartily attached’ to the Whig Party, declared that he was ‘not a Whig’, but ‘one of those amphibious nondescripts called Neutrals’.27 Such equivo- cation was a useful stance for a moral crusader. Wilberforce and his friends lent their support to penal reform at home, but it was not mentioned as a cause by James Stephen in his account of the group.28
 Even when abolition had cleared the way for other Evangelical projects to progress, it was never high on their extraordinary list of Christian 23 John Wolffe, ‘Clapham Sect (act. 1792–1815)’, ODNB. 24 For church parties referred to, see Ford K. Brown, Fathers of the Victorians (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961), pp. 349, 51; W. J. Conybeare, ‘Church Parties, ed. Arthur Burns’, in Stephen Taylor (ed.), From Cranmer to Davidson (Woodbridge: Boydell, 1999), pp. 213–386. Tallach was the first secretary of the Howard League for Prison Reform (1866). For Quakers and penal reform, see Chapter 4.
 objectives. The Rev. William John Conybeare (1815–1857), in a cele- brated essay on Anglican ‘church parties’ in 1855, presented the Evan- gelical Party in the Church of England as the agents responsible for ‘those acts of national morality, which will give an abiding glory to the present century’.29 Conybeare credited Wilberforce, Macaulay, Stephen, Thornton, Buxton and other ‘Evangelical champions’ with almost all the social reforms of the Victorian era, from the suppression of the slave trade to penal reform, the abolition of suttee and the protection of miners and factory workers.30 This representation was far from just to the broad alliance of reformers, from across the denominational and political spec- trum, who worked towards the same social goals. Nevertheless, Evangel- icals were opinion leaders on questions of national morality, and this mattered in debates about penal reform and penal colonies.
 In the late eighteenth century concerns about public morality had given rise to numerous voluntary associations within the Church of England which had the general purpose of the ‘reform of manners’, among them the Society to Effect the Enforcement of his Majesty’s Proclamation Against Vice and Immorality (better known as the Vice Society) which was formed in 1788, the same year as the First Fleet arrived in Botany Bay.31 Anglican Evangelicals were concerned at the potential threat to public order posed by religious enthusiasm outside the established church, including among the new Methodists, who caused constant irritation through their habits of itinerancy and direct spiritual appeal to people outside the parish system, and the older Dissenters with their traditions of radical objections to state power. At home they sought to emulate the Dissenters’ committed missionary dedication to the uplift of the poor, recognizing that some of John Wesley’s most dramatic and effective preaching was conducted in prisons and to prisoners.32 Angli- can Evangelicals were also concerned that religious work in the empire was being left in the hands of societies outside the Church, such as the Baptist Missionary Society (1792) and the London Missionary Society (1795), while the older established societies, such as the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK), were unwelcoming to Evangelical candidates.
 It was within this context that the Eclectic Society first met in 1783, made up of Anglican Evangelical and Dissenting clergy and laity, many 29 Conybeare, ‘Church Parties’, p. 263. 30 Ibid. 31 Joanna Innes, ‘Politics and Morals: The Reformation of Manners Movement in Later Eighteenth-Century England’, in Eckhart Hellmuth (ed.), The Transformation of Political Culture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990), pp. 57–118.
 of whom had an interest in overseas missions.33 The Eclectic Society’s most significant achievement was the formation of the Church Mission- ary Society in 1799.34 However, the group’s earliest meetings were concerned more generally with the best means for propagating the gospel in British colonies. Although the records for these meetings have not survived, some sense of the topics discussed can be gleaned from the memoir of Josiah Pratt (1768–1844), the long-time secretary of the Church Missionary Society. For instance, Pratt notes that the question appointed for discussion on 30 October 1786 was: ‘What is the best method for planting and propagating the Gospel in Botany Bay?’ It was intended that this meeting would include the Rev. Richard Johnson (1756–1827), who had been appointed chaplain to the penal colony of New South Wales. Johnson, a Methodist at a time when the followers had not yet decisively split from the Church of England, was not present on 13 November when the Society discussed the new penal colony.35
 35 Johnson’s humane sympathy for the convict is evident from his letters and preaching such as his sermon to all the colonists, free and unfree. Richard Johnson, An Address to the Inhabitants of the Colonies Established in New South Wales and Norfolk Island (London: The Author, 1792). He also served as a magistrate.
 Success for all these imperial Evangelical ventures was, however, far from assured. The turning point in ambitions for a much wider role for Christianity in effecting change in the empire came with the end of the Napoleonic wars. Until this point all activity in overseas territories was subordinated to ensuring the security of the state. Yet even before the final defeat of Napoleon and his exile to Saint Helena, British Evangelic- als proclaimed a special duty laid on Britain to spread the gospel not just in Europe but also to the world. In this way, Botany Bay could be regarded as a colony in the empire of mercy, a place of regeneration of Britain’s spiritual credentials. Such an imperial view of the penal colonies is reflected in the Christian Observer, the journal founded as a vehicle for the Clapham Sect. Published from 1802 until 1874, its editors included leading Evangelical laymen, initially Josiah Pratt and then Zachary Macaulay, from 1802 to 1816. Among other imperial activities, the Christian Observer provided coverage of events in the penal colonies and the South Seas. There were reports on the zealous activity of the New SouthWales Bible Society, reports from the South Sea Islands, where the Gospel of St Luke had been translated into the Tahitian language, and the Rev. Samuel Marsden wrote of the excellent progress of the young New Zealanders under his care in Parramatta, where he had taken them to admire his orchard and vineyards: ‘When I tell them that there is but one God, they advance many arguments to prove my assertion incred- ible.’38 Apart from Marsden, news of the penal colonies among Evangel- ical readers came from reports of the various societies, such as the British and Foreign Bible Society (founded 1804), which had sent out almost nine hundred copies of Bibles and Testaments for the ‘inhabitants of the villages, and the prisoners on board the convict ships’.39 By the 1820s, New South Wales auxiliaries of the major Evangelical societies, including the British and Foreign Bible Society, Religious Tract and Book Society and Church Missionary Society, had been set up on the instigation of 37 Ibid. 38 Christian Observer, vol. 19 (1820), p. 774 39 Christian Observer, vol. 19 (1822), p. 834. A New South Wales Auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society was formed in 1817 with Governor Macquarie as its patron.
 For Evangelicals, the whole world was open for reform and structural change: ‘Now is the time for reviewing our commercial system; for reforming our poor laws, that fruitful source of some of the most baneful evils which afflict society; for extending and perfecting plans of educa- tion; for affording additional facilities of public religious instruction; for improving our code of criminal laws and our system of prison discip- line.’42 These were not separate objectives and campaigns but part of a united assault on the root and branch of evil in society both at home and abroad.
 Meanwhile, in the newly created penal colonies, the Evangelical stamp of church establishment had been assured through the character and personality of the first chaplains appointed to New South Wales, includ- ing Johnson, Marsden and the Rev. William Cowper (1778–1858). Interestingly, Cowper’s eldest son would go on to become one of the leaders of the anti-transportation movement in New South Wales.43 All three early chaplains had obtained their theological training through the Elland Society which provided funds for Evangelicals to attend Oxford and Cambridge and secured their colonial appointments through the patronage of the Clapham Sect. The Eclectic Review heaped their efforts with praise, declaring Marsden, ‘a character that seems expressly formed by Providence to produce an entire and most beneficial change through- out not only the limited tract of New South Wales, but the vast extent of Australasia; to christianize and civilize the barbarians that constitute its original inhabitants, and to re-christianize and re-civilize the horde of 40 Sydney Morning Herald, 10 July 1858, p. 5. Cowper also served as diocesan secretary of the SPG and SPCK.
 All rewarded their patrons by remaining staunchly attached to their Evangelical principles, despite the unpopularity of their views with the more easy-going of the early governors and their civil and military offi- cers. Unwavering in their view of the moral failings of the large body of settlers, both free and unfree, their dismal outlook has not endeared them to contemporary historians.45
 The appointment of Anglican clergy as magistrates in New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land has further contributed to historians’ hostility concerning the role played by established clergy in the penal regime. In her colonial portrait of the Rocks in Sydney, for instance, Grace Karskens argues that the settlement should be seen as an early modern or ‘pre industrial’ community.46 By this she means that patterns of work, family, village and societal norms were not those of modern industrialized people, but were much more like those described in Peter Lazlett’s 1965 classic, The World We Have Lost.47 Although a useful insight, it is only true to a certain extent. The peculiar circumstances of Sydney’s foundation as a penal colony ensured that there were many important differences in the administration and social profile of New South Wales and comparable port communities in the United Kingdom or colonial America.
 One of these differences was in the condition of the established church, which was not quite as it was at home. In England, the integral relation- ship between church and state was reflected in the substantial legal role played by the church courts. These courts gradually lost their powers to enforce their jurisdiction during the late eighteenth century.48 One reason for this was the rise of the Justice of the Peace or magistrate who filled the void which had formerly been taken by the church courts in resolving local conflict and socially disruptive behaviour such as drunk- enness, vagrancy and promiscuity. Since magistrates were unpaid, the role was often discharged by leaders of the local gentry and clergy. By 1831, more than one in five English magistrates were clergy and this may 44 ‘Voyage to Australasia’, Eclectic Review 5.2 (1809), p. 988.
 have been a factor in anti-clericalism in some rural areas.49 The rising status, education and respect for the rural clergy led to increasing reli- ance on the established clergy to agree to act as magistrates (which attracted no salary). This comfortable arrangement was challenged by reaction to the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, when up to eighteen people were killed following a peaceful demonstration calling for parliamentary reform. Two clerical Justices of the Peace on the magistrates’ committee, the Revs. W. R. Hay and Charles Ethelstone, were pilloried by the Radical press for their ineffectual involvement, with Hay accused of being drunk and incompetent and Ethelstone, aged eighty-eight, charac- terized as decrepit and hypocritical. This event did much to lessen respect for clerical magistrates and associate them with a harsh adminis- tration of the law which punished the poor and favoured the ‘old corrup- tion’.50 Influential Evangelicals such as Charles Simeon disapproved of clerical magistrates and insisted clergy be trained for their own, religious profession, not as servants of the state.51 However, clergy remained important until Parliament moved to provide funding which would make possible the rise of an independent secular magistracy in rural areas.52
 Importantly, the second generation of Evangelicals, scarred both by political controversy and rising tensions between high and low church parties, tended to withdraw from public office. In line with Simeon’s recommendation, the Rev. William Cowper was adamant in refusing Governor Macquarie’s requests that he serve as a magistrate.53
 In the penal colonies, which lacked both a gentry class and a clerical hierarchy ruled by a bishop, there were no church courts and greater and lesser offences were perforce dealt with by settler magistrates many of whom had little experience or social standing to equip them for the task. The governors responded by putting pressure on colonial chaplains to take on the role, as was common in England and Ireland. Michael Gladwin notes there were half a dozen clergy magistrates in colonial New South Wales, Norfolk Island and Van Diemen’s Land, including a number of vigilant critics of convictism, such as Thomas Rogers, 49 E. J. Evans, ‘Some Reasons for the Growth of English Rural Anti-Clericalism c.1750– c.1830’, Past & Present, 66.101 (1975), 101.
 Other than their service as magistrates, the activities of the colonial chaplains sent to the penal colonies focused on liturgical duties of divine service, baptisms, weddings and burial services, including attendance at executions. The chief limitation on the effectiveness of the chaplains who were in the colony was simply lack of personnel. When interviewed before the 1812 SC on Transportation, the Rev. Richard Johnson (1756–1827) frankly admitted that to make a difference they would have to pay more than the ten shillings per day or £182 per year that he was receiving.59 During Johnston’s time, the supply of Anglican clergy con- sisted of himself, Fulton on the Hawkesbury River and the Rev. Samuel Marsden for everyone else, with his own church supported by a convict clerk. The former New South Wales governor, Vice Admiral John Hunter (1737–1821), testified that although convicts attended divine service ‘very properly and attentively’, no more than five or six people were listening to Johnston’s sermons.60 He tried to set an example by attending himself. He also sent around constables with instructions to jail anyone found drunk on Sunday. Of the convicts who testified, most confirmed that they hardly ever saw a clergyman and the captains were not reading prayers on convict voyages. On the other hand, considerable 54 Michael Gladwin, Anglican Clergy in Australia, 1788–1850 (Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 2015), pp. 125–128.

 The passing of the Penitentiary Act in 1779 led to a firm redirection of official thinking towards reformatory and away from punitive modes of prison discipline. Although the actual process of reform, and the funding needed to build prisons which could bring these Christian visions of the penitentiary to life, took some time to arrive, the change is reflected in a wealth of new writing on the prison. Gaol chaplains led the way here and, prior to the repeal of the Test Acts in 1828, they were all drawn from the established church and many were Evangelicals. A good example of the implementation of Anglican teaching to the prisoner, influenced by Methodist trends, is reflected in the ‘Select Manual of Devout Exercises’ written by Rev. W. C., chaplain of the New Bailey Prison, Manchester.65
 In the penal colonies, chaplains working with prisoners made use of a range of similar prayer books, such as the Manual of Instruction and Devotion, published by the SPCK in 1827.70 One copy, now in the Ferguson Collection in the Australian National Library, has the inscrip- tion: ‘This Book was given by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge – to the Parochial Lending Library at Port Macquarie in the Colony of New South Wales, in the Diocese of Australia, 1836,’ 66 William E. A. Axon, Annals of Manchester (Heywood, Manchester, 1886), p. 133. Cheek was a Methodist travelling preacher from 1765 to 1768 and published psalms and hymns for the use of St Stephen’s, Salford. See Henry D. Rack, ‘The Providential Moment: Church Building, Methodism, and Evangelical Entryism in Manchester, 1788–1825’, Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire 141 (1991), 247.
 Such arbitrary acts of retribution and mercy were not the norm in the penal colony. These colonial prayers and sermons provide an insight into the kind of religious instruction provided to prisoners of the Crown. Allan Grocott has argued that convicts were ‘irreligious, profane and anti-clerical’, that positive responses to religion were the acts of ‘unctu- ous hypocrites’ and that harshly judgemental teaching was responsible for convict contempt of Protestant parsons.86 This is to misunderstand the theological function of penal religious instruction which mined con- ventional themes of guilt, penitence, forgiveness and spiritual rejuven- ation. It also underestimates the religious commitment of convicts and clergy, including many devout and conscientious pastors who diligently promoted the moral teachings of the day with the means at their disposal.87
 In defence of Millbank, Holford published a series of tracts promoting the use of separation and categorization in prison, and asserting the importance of the prison chaplain and the essential role played by reli- gion, which he called: ‘the most powerful engine that can be applied to the human mind’.94 Advocating religiously based prison reform, Holford called for more funding for religious provision to existing prisons. He served on a series of prison reform committees, consistently champion- ing the use of Anglican chaplains alone in prisons. In speech after speech in the House of Commons, and inquiry after inquiry, Evangelical reform- ers such as Holford convinced themselves that if only prisoners could make good use of their time in confinement it would be possible to make them better men and women. Holford’s poems collected in The Convict’s Complaint in 1815, and the Thanks of the Convict in 1825, that is before and after Milbank, present this view in mawkish rhyme: Thanks be to those who plann’d these silent cells, Where Sorrow’s true-born child, Repentance, dwells; Where Justice, sway’d by Mercy, doth employ Her iron rod to chasten, not destroy.95
 Apart from Milbank, the most important breakthrough for organized prison reform arose when Evangelicals in Parliament came together with reformers among the Whigs and Liberals. This same alignment was responsible for the effective transformation of British anti-slavery from a local, pietistic concern among the Methodists and Quakers, into a national movement.98 The major vehicle for the alliance of ‘Saints’ (Claphamite Evangelicals) and Whigs was the Society for the Improve- ment of Prison Discipline and the Reformation of Juvenile Offenders, better known as the Prison Discipline Society (PDS), which secured support from all parties to this common cause.
 Formed in 1816 at the initiative of the Quaker philanthropists, Thomas Fowell Buxton (1786–1845) and Samuel Hoare II (1751–1825),99 the PDS was originally intended to provide support for the work of their sister-in-law, Elizabeth Fry, in Newgate and to improve, if possible, con- ditions for prisoners in English gaols.100 The PDS was for the issue of penal reform what the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade (1787) and the Anti-Slavery Society (1823) were for the anti-slavery movement, and what the Aborigines’ Protection Society (1837) was for Indigenous people in British colonies, that is a society created by secular and religious activists, including politicians, clergy and business people, to lobby for changes to the law relating to a particular cause, creating a network of local societies to coordinate the work and build a financial and social base.
 With the formation of the PDS, Whigs and Saints secured an organiza- tion to promote Christian principles of penal reform on a broader canvas and with legislative bite. The Society was also a conduit to knowledge about penal reform elsewhere in both Europe and America. Like many of the early reformers, Thomas Buxton was particularly interested in the gaols of Antwerp and Ghent.101 At the Maison de Force at Ghent, the 98 A. D. Kriegel, ‘A Convergence of Ethics: Saints and Whigs in British Antislavery’, Journal of British Studies, 26.4 (1987), 435–450.
 100 Buxton (ed.),Memoirs of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, p. 64: ‘The exertions of Mrs Fry and her associates had prepared the way, public attention had been drawn to the subject; and in 1816 the Society for the Reformation of Prison Discipline was formed.’ 101 Ibid., 68–72.
 As the Society developed, it shifted its membership up the social scale to include more Anglican Evangelicals and fewer Dissenters. PDS meet- ings were regularly reported in the Religious Intelligencer or the Christian Observer, which thus provide insight into Claphamite views on penal reform. In 1819, the PDS approved resolutions moved by Wilberforce and others in support of proper classification of prisoners; the separation of men, women and juveniles; and the regime of ‘humane treatment, constant inspection, moral and religious instruction, judicious classifica- tion, and well regular labour’, which were said to ‘seldom fail, under the Divine blessing, to reclaim the most guilty’.107 The same message was repeated on every possible occasion: ‘Without reformation, the object of prison discipline cannot be attained: without religious impressions, 102 Society for Diffusing Information on the Subject of Capital Punishment and Prison Discipline, An Account of the Maison de Force at Ghent from the Philanthropist, May 1817 (London: Taylor, 1817), p. 7.
 reformation is utterly hopeless.’108 With the revision of its membership away from the Quaker elite and towards the Evangelical middle class, the religious and emotional sympathies of the Society were impregnated with a more belligerent and quasi-official tone. Besides the dominance of politicians, the Society began corresponding and investigating the status of county gaols in England and compiling data for the House of Com- mons SC on Gaols (1818, 1819), the first of many committees it effect- ively directed. The committee itself was chaired by the banker Samuel Hoare III (1783–1847), who had broken with his father’s Quakerism and become an Anglican, and included six politicians – all of themWhigs and Radicals, including the Hon. Henry Grey Bennet (1777–1836) and Stephen Lushington (1782–1873).
 The PDS consistently opposed transportation, basing their view on information received from the Rev. Samuel Marsden in New South Wales, as well as the testimony of clergy, officers and convicts and former convicts to a series of parliamentary select committees. Throughout the 1810s, as the merits of the penitentiary were debated in Parliament, Bennet, Wilberforce, Romilly and other penal reformers continued to make objections to transportation and promote the virtues of properly conducted prisons and penitentiaries in Britain and Ireland and oppose transportation. In 1812 Romilly objected that transportation had been in place in New South Wales for twenty-five years without any proof of the benefit of the system.109 By 1819, when the government was awaiting the outcome of the SC on Gaols, the leading penal reformers of the day including Bennet, Wilberforce and Sir James Mackintosh, were again actively lobbying for drastic changes to the system, making use of Mars- den’s correspondence for conditions in the colony.110 In a very long speech, Bennet made a detailed condemnation of the system in New South Wales which was corrupting to women and children and made little if any provision for the religious instruction of Catholics.111 At the same time, the number of convictions for serious crimes was so high that it was clear that all hope that transportation had been reformative were seriously mistaken.112 In its eighth report for 1819, the PDS noted the ‘prevalent feeling among offenders in [this] country that transportation is but a separation from connexions, and affords a prospect of successful 108 Christian Observer, vol. 22 (1822), p. 821. 109 Hansard, HC Deb, vol. 21, col. 6044, February 1812. 110 Samuel Marsden, The Letters and Journals of Samuel Marsden, 1765–1838, ed.

 Bigge was appointed by Henry Bathurst (1762–1834), Secretary of State for War and the Colonies from 1812 to 1827 in the Tory ministry of Lord Liverpool, to undertake a review of the colonial administration of New South Wales, including its ‘Laws, Regulations and Usages, Civil Military and Ecclesiastical’.116 A moderate Tory who sympathized with William Wilberforce, Bathurst favoured the amelioration rather than the abolition of slavery.117 His instructions to Bigge were to change the direction of the colony from one intended to support its economic growth for the benefit of the settlers and former convicts to one of punishment: ‘Transportation to New South Wales is intended as a severe Punishment applied to 113 Eighth Report of the Committee of the Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline (London: Bensley, 1832), p. 5.
 Bigge’s report on the state of ecclesiastical establishments inNew South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land was included in the third of his reports on New South Wales.124 It enumerated the religious and charitable insti- tutions of the colony, including clergy, chaplains and schools, and was focussed substantially on the established church. Reporting on the Bible Society, Bigge concluded: ‘there has existed no want of zeal in the local authorities of New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land, in the clergy of the established church, or in those who are not members of it, to promote the interests of religion and morals amongst the lower classes of the inhabitants’.125 Detailed recommendations beyond this dry assessment, which said next to nothing about religious services for convicts, owed much to Thomas Hobbes Scott (1783–1860), who was later appointed archdeacon of New South Wales with a mandate to implement a plan for the establishment of the Church of England in the colony. Much more information about religion in the colony was gathered as evidence about ecclesiastical establishments, schools and charitable societies, forming part of the vast unpublished appendix of 600 folios to the report.126 In presenting a picture of the religious condition of the colony, Bigge recorded hundreds of letters, notes of interview and brochures of the colony’s many religious and philanthropic societies. Charities favoured by the ‘exclusivist’ (anti-emancipist) faction showed their aversion to the children of the colony rising above themselves. For instance,The Rules and Regulations of the Female Orphan Institutions (1818) directed: ‘The Chil- dren of this Institution are to be educated only in View to their present Condition in Life, and future Destination; namely, as the Wives or Ser- vants of common Settlers, Mechanics and labouring People.’127
 layman in the colony, though only in respect of Eager’s critique of the failings of Judge Barron Field (1786–1846).128 Bigge seems to have ignored the lively Catholic, Presbyterian and smaller Dissenting ministries who, though few in number, might have challenged his final recommen- dations. Settlers, officers and clergy were asked whether they saw any evidence of reformation by convicts and former convicts, a key claim of Macquarie. To a man, they said not. Major George Druitt (1775?–1842), an Irish-born former soldier and Chief Engineer of the Colonial Establish- ment, thought ‘more complete separation’ might be useful for the con- victs, especially the boys: ‘as their reform in the present State appears to be hopeless’.129 When asked about a chapel for the convict barracks in Sydney’s Hyde Park, he stated that there was no chapel, ‘but the Clergy- man reads prayers & gives a lecture every Wednesday Evening to such as chose to attend; & on Sundays Divine Service is performed by him when all are obliged to attend’. Druitt was also asked whether a chapel and school should be built in the barracks. He approved the construction of a chapel in the school, largely because this would prevent escapes which occurred when prisoners were marched to church in town.130
 The impact of the Bigge Report on Transportation was augmented by changes to prison management in England. These ensured that for the next twenty years, there would be a strong Evangelical strand dominating most theories and practices of penal reform. The Bigge Report opened up new sites for penal transportation across the settler colonies, including Macquarie Harbour in Van Diemen’s Land, which operated from 1822 to 1833, Norfolk Island which reopened in 1824 and Moreton Bay which operated from 1824 to 1839. The main purpose of these additional penal settlements was to harshen the experience of transportation and make it more of a deterrent to crime at home, in line with Bathurst’s instructions to Bigge. The Gaol Act of 1823 precipitated further change, imposing the requirement of reporting centrally to Parliament and more rigorous stand- ards for prison officers, especially the chaplain. The chaplain was slowly transformed from a religious counsellor to the most senior reporting official, other than the governor, in every prison, penal station and peni- tentiary. In this way, Evangelical religion, supported by the Tories in government, became associated with some of the most infamous and repressive institutions in the British Empire. This was not the intention of Evangelicals engaged in penal reform, who consistently advocated for the humane reform of prisoners in place of the punitive and bloody code of an earlier era. However, it was the effect of the action of the PDS and the creation of the Milbank penitentiary and the new sites of ultra-penal isolation and punishment.
 This chapter has examined the Evangelical contribution to the penal reform of the empire, a project which was embraced by a small number of Claphamites, including William Wilberforce, as part of the grand plan to improve the empire. The age of atonement, reflected in the theology and politics of post-Revolutionary Britain, saw the coming together of a 133 Ibid., I.153. 134 William Macquarie Cowper, The Autobiography and Reminiscences of William Macquarie Cowper, Dean of Sydney (Sydney: Angus & Robertson, 1902). 135 Ritchie and Bigge, Evidence, p. I.157.
 coalition of Tory, Whig and what Buxton called ‘neutral’ forces to renew the criminal code and reform penal discipline. The main vehicle for this was the Penal Discipline Society, which consistently opposed transporta- tion and promoted the penitentiary as a better alternative. Where Ben- tham had presented secular arguments in favour of the Panopticon and against New South Wales, the PDS was not so convinced that there would be a single, best solution to the problem of how to reform rather than simply punish criminals. The experiment of Millbank, greeted as the fulfilment of the ideals of John Howard, was captured by its Evangel- ical advocates, such as George Holford. The failure of the first peniten- tiary to meet the unreasonable expectations placed on it for reform by religion and work alone meant that transportation would continue for the foreseeable future. While a wide range of voices were involved in the cause of penal reform, with Anglican Evangelicals only one part of a hearty chorus, they represented those who were most committed to penal reform as an aspect of the unified church state and the realization of the moral empire. The real strength of the Prison Discipline Society was the alliance that it forged between Anglican Evangelicals, leading Quaker advocates of penal reform and Whigs and Radicals who supported penal reform in parliament. As the expertise of the Society developed, it became an effective advocate in favour of penitentiaries and reformist solutions at home rather than transportation abroad, with the testimony of Samuel Marsden, Elizabeth Fry and sympathetic convict surgeons about the vulnerability of convict women critical to the campaign.
 But transportation had plenty of time still to run. So long as there was one established church in England and Ireland and one in Scotland, imperial institutions would reflect the hierarchy and values of the church establishment overseas as well. With the bringing down of the Bigge Reports, the task which now confronted all Anglican penal reformers was how to reform the hulks and penal colonies springing up in Australia in the direction of greater uniformity and harsher punishment so that it would be truly a ‘terror to evil doers’. Bigge encouraged the creation of colonial church establishments in both New South Wales and Van Die- men’s Land, which were intended to provide ‘national’ (that is, Anglican) personnel and institutions, including churches, schools and prisons, to uphold the existing social order. Taken together, these reforms were intended to reform and moralize the penal colonies until the happy day when adequate penitentiaries, constructed for this purpose in the home country, might do away with the necessity for transportation altogether. One governor, Sir George Arthur, believed that it was possible to build an Evangelical system of penal reform in the penal colonies. His attempt to make this happen in Van Diemen’s Land is the subject of the next chapter.
 What has not been sufficiently taken into consideration in assessing Arthur’s regime was his committed Anglican Evangelicalism which impacted on all aspects of his personal and public life. In the 1830s, he was the chief defender of convict transportation against its critics. It was Arthur who believed – and acted – on the assumption that transportation was a key element of a coherent programme of penal discipline, and that it was both morally and administratively sound. It was Arthur, in collab- oration with Archdeacon Broughton, who published a rebuttal of Arch- bishop’s Whately’s arguments against the reformative claims of transportation. Against the scandalous allegations of the Molesworth SC on Transportation, before which he appeared as a witness, Arthur defended his system with considerable authority. He saw off Macono- chie’s accusation that it lacked science, humanity, justice and reason,7
 Arthur the Evangelical Sustained by well-placed Evangelical friends, Arthur’s regime in Van Diemen’s Land had something of the character of Zachary Macaulay’s in Sierra Leone, the colony of former and freed slaves founded by Evangelicals to spearhead the conversion of Africa a generation earlier. Catherine Hall has called Macaulay’s governorship of Sierra Leone ‘a new imperial experiment, a laboratory for the benevolent empire of God’, values Arthur shared for Van Diemen’s Land.11 Macaulay served as governor from 1794 to 1799 before returning to England and devoting himself to the anti-slavery cause, as well as to numerous other charitable and religious societies.12 Before, during and after his appointment to Van Diemen’s Land, Arthur corresponded with leading Evangelicals, includ- ing William Wilberforce, James Stephen, Thomas Fowell Buxton and Zachary Macaulay, who encouraged his work of humane and Christian 9 Sir William Molesworth, ‘Affairs of Canada’, Hansard, HC Deb, vol. 39, col. 1462–1463, 22 December 1837.
 governance.13 Following the death of Arthur’s eldest son, James Stephen devoted a Sunday afternoon to writing him a lengthy letter of condolence and encouragement. He comforted Arthur by stressing the significance of his work in laying the foundations for a powerful future state which might be a force for good or evil: ‘Of what incalculable importance will not the establishment of a christian nation & enlightened state be in the centre of the eastern hemisphere & within reach of the Chinese Hindoo & Mahommedan nations which surround you.’14 Stephen’s advice was to use practical means for this object: ‘Schools, missionaries, Bibles, prayer books are the things you want & the weapons you must use.’15 Reports of Arthur’s support for Evangelical projects, including the New Zealand missions of the Church Missionary Society were duly reported in the Christian Observer,16 as was his earlier intervention on behalf of female slaves.17 Arthur was instrumental in facilitating the attempt by George Augustus Robinson (1791–1866) to ‘save the remnant’ of the Tasmanian Aborigines in the wake of the failed military exercise aimed at their removal as a threat to colonists.
 Beyond the penal establishment, Arthur wanted a complete religious system to serve both civil and convict society. He acted on Earl Bath- urst’s mandate to Thomas Hobbes Scott (1783–1860), the first arch- deacon of New South Wales (and Bigge’s secretary), who in 1824 tasked Scott with devising an Anglican ecclesiastical establishment for New South Wales, including clergy, churches and schools. Accompanying Commissioner Bigge to Australia, Scott’s knowledge of the colony was unrivalled, however he was officious and unpopular with his own clergy and showed little sympathy for the needs of the convicts. Bigge reported that colonial efforts to promote religion were not wanting but that the dispersed nature of the settlements and the ‘depraved habits of the people’ were impediments to religion and education.31 While there was evident need for churches and schools, Scott’s assumption of the ascend- ancy of the Church of England antagonized Methodist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist and Catholic colonists who were essential to their successful operation.
 Reports of 21 April 1826, 14 April 1828 and 19 August 1830.32 In the first memorandum, Arthur aimed to create an Anglican establishment for the colony of Van Diemen’s Land like those already in place in Nova Scotia (1787), Quebec (1793), Calcutta (1814), Jamaica (1824) and Barbados (1824).33 However, the legislative standing of the established church had been undercut by the repeal of the Test Acts (1828) and the Roman Catholic Relief Act (1829), securing new rights for dissenting Protestants and Catholics. While Arthur made an open avowal of his support for the Church of England: ‘I have at heart the extension of the Church to which my family and myself are so warmly attached’, he was not rigidly sectarian. He opposed the excessive claims for the established church advanced by Scott and Broughton.34 He wrote to James Stephen that, having discovered Broughton was a high churchman ‘strongly exclusive & strictly opposed to the Evangelical clergy’, he hoped he would have no power to appoint ministers for the colony.35 For prag- matic reasons, he supported the Wesleyans, whom he thought best suited to the convicts, as well as Evangelicals for everyone else. If a full church establishment was to be erected, it must also be generously subsidized by the home government.
 clergy to attack this problem with the tools of their Protestant faith, the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer and ‘some one or more comprehen- sive Manuals of the Doctrines and Duties of the Christian Religion’. He recommended that they support the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (failing to mention the Church Missionary Society, its Evangelical rival, which was patronized by Colonel Arthur), and establish parochial schools. Parents, ‘who were themselves vicious’, were to be prevailed upon to send their children to school, where their sense of sin might be appro- priately moderated. Apart from this gentle hint, there is no reference to the penal population of Hobart; rather this was a pastoral message from a high church bishop with a sense of his duty to lead, comfort and unite his clergy.
 One of Arthur’s most original reforms was to secure Dissenters rather than Anglicans as salaried catechists to penal stations. For his scheme of establishment, Scott had requested ten additional clergy, including one for each of the penal stations of Macquarie Harbour and Maria Island, as well as a rural dean to cover for him during his absences.37 While Scott assumed that all these appointments would come from the established church, Arthur demurred. In 1825, he wrote to James Stephen request- ing ‘reinforcement of the Church and School Establishment – especially of Ministers suited to this Colony’, by which he meant those sympathetic to his own low churchmanship.38 A year later he suggested that convict chaplains might as well be Methodists: ‘Their Services may no doubt be obtained at a very moderate charge, and I should conceive they would be better qualified for the Office than any Gentlemen who have received a Liberal University Education.’39 Ever diligent, Arthur had already con- tacted the resident Wesleyan missionary in Hobart, Benjamin Carvosso (1789–1834), and discussed with him the appointment of two convict chaplains which he was willing to support so long as the government contributed to their salaries. Arthur’s request was put to the Wesleyan Methodist Conference, who approved the appointment of the first mis- sionaries in 1826, one for Macquarie Harbour and another for Maria Island. In 1827 William Schofield (1790–1878) arrived in Hobart Town from where he was appointed, with initial reluctance on his part, as 37 Arthur to Bathurst, 27 April 1826, TNA CO 325/28. 38 Arthur to Stephen, 23 April 1835, Arthur Papers, vol. 4, SLNSW A2164 [CY Reel, 675]. 39 Arthur to Bathurst, 27 April 1826, TNA CO 325/28: 9.
 Schofield remained at the challenging post of Macquarie Harbour for four years until he was replaced by John Allen Manton (1807–1864) in 1832. On Macquarie Harbour’s closure shortly afterwards, and the pris- oners’ transfer to Port Arthur, Manton went with them to become Port Arthur’s first resident religious officer. There he officiated at its elegant church, overseeing the school as well as cooperating with religious instructors in probation stations to general satisfaction. Following the disruptive intervention of Bishop Francis Nixon, the fourteen-year experiment with Methodist ministry to the convicts came to an end. At Port Arthur, the replacement of Manton with a prickly Anglican chaplain led to a major battle (considered in Chapter 8).49 In a despatch issued in 1834, Eardley Wilmot reported to the colonial secretary, Lord Stanley (1799–1869) on the impact of Durham’s arrival, noting that the news of Manton’s replacement by Durham had ‘created a sensation’, with significant consequences. Whereas before Christians of all denomin- ations, including Presbyterians, Wesleyans, Independents and Roman 47 Benjamin Carvosso, ‘Methodism in Van Diemen’s Land’, Wesleyan Methodist Magazine, 49 (1831), 250–51.
 Catholics, had been happy to attend the one place of worship at Port Arthur, the arrival of a Church of England clergyman with claims of precedence and plans to consecrate the church for the use of the estab- lished church had led to a general strike: ‘all of these different creeds inform us that they cannot conscientiously attend the Church of England Service’.50 Durham was to find equal difficulty in trying to wrest control of the school from the independent schoolmaster.
 At the same time as Scott and Broughton were hoping to entrench Anglican establishment, including exclusive support for Church of Eng- land schools, there was a change of government and with it a change in policy from quasi-establishment, which favoured the Church of England, to liberal support for major Christian denominations on the basis of their colonial population.51 Colonial church establishments were dismantled, including the expensive apparatus of clergy reserves in Upper Canada, New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land, and in their place multi- denominational arrangements were installed, pioneered in New South Wales by the liberal governor, General Sir Richard Bourke (1777–1855), and implemented through the Church Acts for New South Wales (1836) and Van Diemen’s Land (1837).52 This involved dissolving the arrange- ments created to support the Clergy and School Lands Corporation, despatched by Earl Bathurst in 1825 to Governor Sir Thomas Bris- bane.53 The Church of England lost both its entitlement to one-seventh of all lands in New South Wales and its right to support an exclusively Anglican or ‘national’ education system. On the other hand, Governor Bourke’s Church Act of 1836, which required communities to contribute to the funding of churches and schools, led to an immediate and gratify- ing improvement in the staffing and construction of churches and schools.54 Suddenly there was an opportunity for most parts of the Colony of New South Wales (and later other colonies as well) to meet community demand for religion and education.
 With great satisfaction, Bourke wrote to Lord Glenelg (Secretary of State for the Colonies in the Whig administration of Viscount Mel- bourne), enclosing a letter received from Broughton with a list of places 50 Eardley Wilmot to Lord Stanley, 1843; Brand, Port Arthur 1830–1877, p. 39. 51 Peter Burroughs, ‘Lord Howick and Colonial Church Establishment’, Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 25.4 (1974), 381–405. 52 David Stoneman, ‘Richard Bourke: For the Honour of God and the Good of Man’, Journal of Religious History, 38.3 (2013), 341–355. 53 For despatches relevant to these changes between Governor Richard Bourke and Glenelg, see BPP 1837 (112) XLIII.21. 54 See John Barrett, That Better Country (Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 1966), pp. 16, 17, 79 and 81, for maps showing churches and stationing of clergymen in New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land before and after the Church Acts.
 which had all subscribed more than £300 and were therefore, under the terms of the Church Act, entitled to a clergyman. Bourke suggested that the men selected for these appointments might be offered passage in a convict ship: ‘I am persuaded that great benefit would accrue to the convicts from the opportunity which would thus be afforded of imparting religious instruction during the Voyage.’55 Over the next few years, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG), in coordination with the Colonial Office, approved the appointment and passages – on either convict or emigrant ships – of a stream of clergy, including a small number intended to provide religious instruction on convict hulks and transports and convict establishments. Catholic clergy also served as religious instructors on ships leaving Ireland, though this created other difficulties.56 Finally, the governor of New South Wales, Sir George Gipps (1791–1847), wrote to the home secretary, Constantine Phipps, the Marquis of Normanby, asking him to stop approving any additional appointments because of the dramatic impact it was having on colonial finances which had risen almost three-fold, from an estimated £13,242 in 1834 to £34,066 in 1840.57 The end of convict transportation to New South Wales in 1840 put a further brake on government support. On 8 August 1840, Lord John Russell wrote to the archbishop of Can- terbury rejecting his request for additional religious instruction for the convicts in New South Wales.58 Thanks to Bourke, Arthur and their successors, in a little over ten years, religious provision for free and convict people of the penal colonies had been put in place. From very different political perspectives, Arthur and Bourke both believed that religious training would allow for the reformation of the criminal from within, creating that moral realm which was the proper objective of all Christian rulers.
 to justify the expense of establishment, supplemented by the Methodist ministry, inspired Arthur to articulate a considered philosophy for the penal colony, one which was simultaneously nationalistic and moral, as well as worth the expense. In 1826 Arthur wrote grandly to Lord Bathurst (1762–1834): This Colony must be considered in the light of an extensive Gaol to the Empire, the punishment of criminals and reformation of criminals, the grand objects, in its penal character, to be obtained to, and these, under Providence, can alone be affected by the presence of a respectable Military Force; – by the erection of proper places for confinement:– by an active judicial establishment;- by a more general diffusion of knowledge, and by the powerful operation of Religion.59
 Arthur urged the need for better religious provision: for the convicts, for the free settlers and for the rising generation. Scott had asked for a rural dean to officiate for him in his absence, but Arthur asked instead for an 59 Arthur to Bathurst, 27 April 1836, ‘Memoranda on New South Wales and Tasmania Clergy’, TNA CO 325/28: 13–14.
 In New South Wales, even Sir Ralph Darling, a religiously committed Tory high churchman, was reluctant to see the establishment of a cum- bersome Church and School Corporation with endowed lands which, if unsuccessful, would leave a heavy capital burden on the colonial govern- ment. In Van Diemen’s Land, Arthur suggested that there should be a separate fund administered by the Lt Governor and a committee of public officers: ‘By this arrangement the fund would still be saved from the interference of any future Legislative Assembly.’66 This last comment suggests another factor driving the evident anxiety of both Scott and Arthur for a solution. They were both aware that the religious character of the colonies was not exclusively Anglican and that once a more democratic mode of government was established it was unlikely that a 63 Frederick Maitland Innes, ‘The Convict System of Van Diemen’s Land’, Monthly Chronicle, 5.27 (1840), 437.
 fund intended for the benefit of the church established in England (but not in the Australian colonies) would survive. But Arthur was nothing if not pragmatic and he adjusted well to the opportunities provided by the Church Act. By January 1836, he could provide an intimately detailed account of the expenditure on places of worship for all the major denom- inations, including Wesleyans, Independents, Roman Catholics as well as members of the established church (Anglicans); he was less sure about the Presbyterians and Quakers.67 He continued to regard provision for the poor and prisoners as a mission best suited to the Wesleyans: ‘Their system of instruction appears to be admirably adapted to attract the lower classes, and to win them especially from low, degrading vices.’68 By the end of his administration he had increased the number of government schools from two to twenty-nine, including one for the boys of Point Puer at Port Arthur, and the number of churches from four to eighteen, with grants for Catholic, Presbyterian, Baptist and Independent (i.e., Congregational) chapels, as well as Anglican churches at Richmond and New Town. It was a respectable and relatively even-handed provision.69
 The committee attracted considerable attention with important contri- butions made not just by those who testified to the SC but also by those across the political and religious spectrum who were engaged by the issues it raised: what was the most effective punishment for those who committed crimes for which the erosion of the ‘bloody code’ meant that execution was no longer a final solution?78
 The transportation debate was also influenced by Edward Gibbon Wakefield (1796–1862), whose accounts of his prison experiences, begun while he was still under sentence in Newgate, asserted that trans- portation was an unmitigated boon for criminals and advocated ‘system- atic’ colonization by free rather than convict settlers.79 Wakefield’s views were promoted through the influential quarterlies which shaped public opinion: he was favourably reviewed by Charles Dodd in the Quarterly Review,80 and, together with the SC Report on Secondary Punishments, in the Law Magazine.81 The Law Magazine affirmed the common view, heavily endorsed by Wakefield, that transportation was not a punish- ment, and that private assignment of convicts in penal colonies was nothing other than ‘domestic slavery’.82 The appearance of Wakefield’s books was a significant moment in the moral debate around transporta- tion. It represented an early salvo in the campaigns of the Colonial Reform Society, soon to play a prominent role in advocating colonial self-government, free emigration and an end to convict labour.83
 made this point with one of his more long-winded and belaboured metaphors: ‘While I would support and encourage in their holy offices the ministers of religion, while I would promote the spread of religious information, while I would depend upon the labours of zealous and pious men as among the most desirable agents of crime prevention; I would expel those . . . who choke the good seed sown by them.’90 Arthur also made the valid point that penitentiary convicts in England and America were just as much slaves, with no property in their own labour, whereas in Van Diemen’s Land, effectively classified, subject to the oversight of stipendiary police, private assignment provided them with some hope. ‘The spirit of the convict’, Arthur claimed, ‘is not subdued by unmingled severity’ but, with good behaviour, led to a ticket-of-leave and a gateway to free society.91 At the same time, the ‘worst men’ were isolated in penal settlements. The system worked because the private master had a direct interest in the reform of prisoners, on whom he depended to secure the success of his farm.92 As for the claim that the colony was a ‘community of felons’, the reality was that property was as safe as it was in England: ‘The most respectable families, even in the interior are free from annoy- ance and live in comfort.’93 What is more, they were generous in their support of religious, charitable and educational causes, which Arthur saw as a matter of imperial pride and evidence that ‘the best feelings of the British character retain their original lustre even in this penal colony’.94 If the colony was to prosper, moreover, it needed labour, which Arthur considered to be more important than ensuring the free character of all who settled there. In another back-handed dig at Whately, he compared his own system of punishments and rewards, with its prospect of joining an increasingly prosperous colony, to Whately’s alternative proposal of forced labour on the Irish bogs. Finally, Arthur concluded, transporta- tion really did lead to reform; it prevented crime and contributed to the rise of the colonies.95 If only the system had worked as well as Arthur claimed, the transportation of convicts might have continued for decades.
 Reflecting on his experience in English parishes, Broughton claimed that the problem of rising crime was not related to any change in the efficacy or mode of punishment, but from a ‘diminished prevalence of the fear of God’. Broughton denigrated the archbishop of Dublin’s discussion of crime, noting that he made no reference to morality. Such a defect, he noted, was unexpected in a bishop and theologian, but left him instead ‘among the ranks of a jurist and a politician’.98 Whately, the only liberal Anglican appointed to the House of Lords, would soon reply in kind to this slur on his moral credentials (see Chapter 5). As the collective voice of church and state for the penal colony, Broughton and Arthur were doubly authoritative, which is no doubt why Arthur invited Broughton to join him in replying to Whately. Broughton drew attention to the alliance in his letter, recalling their visit to a convict road party where Broughton performed divine service: ‘you will testify I think that there could not possibly be a congregation displaying more fixed attention than these men, who continued standing during the prayers and sermon’.99
 Broughton then returned to his main assertion, namely that transporta- tion had been condemned too quickly, that it was as effective a means of reformation as other forms of secondary punishment and, even if not ‘improved in morals’, by their removal to the penal colony convicts were less of a danger to society than if they remained at home.100
 This was a full and well-reasoned response, showing humanity to the convicts, respect for their capacity to reform (even while recognizing this as rare) and arguing that transportation was better than the alternatives. It accorded with the view of convicts which Broughton developed in his recommendation to Arthur about the structure of a proposed church to serve the Hobart penitentiary, which he thought should incorporate space for free and unfree members of the congregation to worship together. Broughton’s arguments about transportation were also based on his extensive colonial experience and his diligent travels around both New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land. His interventions were sincere and well-argued and emphatically rejected the view that abolish- ing transportation would have any impact on crime at home whereas it may, in Broughton’s view, provide better outcomes for colony and convict in the empire. Broughton decried the ‘fashionable feeling’ of wanting a church ‘pure from the contamination of a convict congre- gation’.101 Since outwardly convicts continued to be members of the 97 Ibid., 85. 98 Ibid., 87. 99 Ibid., 109. 100 Ibid., 110–111. 101 Broughton to Sir George Arthur, 6 August 1830, USPG C/AUS/TAS 4.
 church, they therefore had every right to participate in its services: ‘we have no right to banish them from the general assembly of the congre- gation’.102 Broughton saw participation in communal religious service as a key part of the reformative training.103 While an admiral theory, the penal associations and awkward arrangements in the Penitentiary Chapel designed by colonial architect John Lee Archer (1791–1852) in 1829 (which included thirty-six cells for solitary confinement beneath the Chapel floor) ensured it was not a success with Hobart’s free church- goers.
 With Archdeacon Broughton (and against Archbishop Whately), Arthur therefore renewed the call for additional religious and clerical services as a way to reduce crime. In an extraordinary phrase, he refers to ministers of religion as ‘parts of a moral mechanism’ which might be engaged to stop crime ‘at its fountain head’, that is in the hearts of criminals.110 As we have seen, Arthur was trying to persuade the Colonial Office to strengthen the ‘moral mechanism’ of Van Diemen’s Land with an adequate ecclesiastical establishment. The public pamphleteering should be seen as part of his frustration at the slow progress of his private lobbying with government.
 As a means to reinforce the ‘moral restraint’, which was the surest guard against criminality, Arthur concluded that transportation was a better option than any other. By recommending the abolition of private assign- ment, Molesworth would place an intolerable burden on the small cadre of religious instructors and clergy charged with achieving the same kind of reformative effect, with none of the financial inducements supplied by Arthur’s highly regulated system.
 ‘natural penitentiary’ of Port Arthur and the Forestier Peninsula, which he regarded as a great imperial gaol. Like the penitentiaries proposed by penal reformers at home, Arthur’s ‘natural penitentiary’ was supported and enhanced by religious personnel. Arthur’s extensive correspondence with the Colonial Office and his Evangelical friends in England, as well as his collaboration with Archdeacons Scott and Broughton over the cre- ation of an appropriate religious establishment for Van Diemen’s Land, show how seriously he took the need for religious as well as physical means to ensure transportation was properly punitive and reformative. Working together with the leading churchmen of the colony, he provided a defence of transportation against the critique of Archbishop Whately, the blustering of Edward Gibbon Wakefield and the evidence marshalled by the SC on Secondary Punishments. He supported the appointment of Methodist ministers with a special duty to convicts in the toughest of the ultra-penal stations, such as Macquarie Harbour.
 undergoing transportation. The Quaker view was also reflected in the Prison Discipline Society (PDS), which members helped found and which undergirded systematic reforms demanded by the Secondary Punishments Committee, a vehicle for the PDS and its friends.3 In this chapter, however, we will examine the work of Quakers in the field, reporting, recommending and seeking just and Christian solutions to the problem of crime.
 bodies, end private assignment and abolish convict transportation.8 By tethering religion to nationalism, Peter van der Veer argues that the evangelical revival created a profound shift in British politics, effectively producing a new moral state.9 The ‘evangelical project’, he maintains, which engaged active Quakers, ‘convert[ed] people to a morally inspired existence in which individual conscience of sins and atonement are catchwords, within a nation with a colonizing mission that is inter- preted as liberating’.10 Hence the moral empire expanded well beyond the established domains of the fused church and state of the old regime, providing significant opportunities for Dissenting Christians to make their mark. Among the first to do so were the Quakers.11
 American Quakers were the first to marry utilitarian and religious approaches for prison design and prisoner reform. In his study of Quaker prison reformers, Christopher Adamson suggests that the Quakers’ call to penal reform arose from their conversion to a more evangelical interpretation of Christianity than had traditionally charac- terized the movement’s mainstream.14 Evangelicalism encouraged Quakers’ rediscovery of Christianity’s more active face and they sought to extend the redeeming power of the cross to suffering humanity, including slaves, poor families, wounded soldiers and those incarcer- ated in institutions.15 Quaker activism was regulated and authorized by means of ‘travelling under concern’ (approval from Meeting for a visit on a particular social purpose). James Backhouse and George Washing- ton Walker received such authorization for their visit to the penal colonies of Australia, South Africa and Mauritius, reporting on condi- tions for convicts, slaves and Aborigines.16 On both sides of the Atlantic and, subsequently, across the globe, Friends were informed on events elsewhere through the visitation of ministers bearing ‘concerns’ with them, such as Stephen Grellet (1773–1855), who restlessly crossed Europe, then America and Britain pursuing the causes of anti-slavery, penal reform and hospitals. It was Grellet who introduced Elizabeth Fry and her sister to the needs of female prisoners, a work she was soon to make her own.17
 Some Quakers, especially younger ones, were attracted to the freer ways and opportunities for more ardent expression offered by other noncon- formist churches.21 Pressure to reject the world slowly led some Quakers to leave the Society and enter the evangelical mainstream, which was not so hostile to practices such as marrying out or social activism. In Amer- ica, Quakerism split into evangelical, conservative and liberal branches. The evangelicals gave the highest priority to penal reform and social issues.22
 These divisions between Friends are important for British penal reform. Indeed, most of the best-known ‘Quakers’ involved in penal reform became so after they had left the Society of Friends. The Buxtons were disowned for non-attendance in 1816 and 1817. William and Mary Howitt, two Friends who emigrated to Australia, resigned from the Society in 1847. Mary was frustrated by the Society’s closed nature; ‘They would not read books. They would not go into society.’23
 After John Howard, Mrs Elizabeth Fry, née Gurney (1780–1845), is probably the best known of all the British penal reformers; her major contribution was in effecting change for women prisoners.26 Like Flor- ence Nightingale, Fry was celebrated in her lifetime as something of a living saint. While Nightingale, along with other ‘eminent Victorians’, was disparaged by Lytton Strachey in 1918, Fry’s reputation has survived remarkably intact.27 ‘Everyone knows the popular conception of Flor- ence Nightingale’, wrote Strachey, ‘But the truth was different.’28 The truth is also different about Fry and she deserves recognition for her extraordinary persistence, powers of organization and effective delega- tion; her contribution to the cause of prison reform in Europe, the United States as well as in Britain and the convict colonies; and her total commitment to the work of women for women.29
 When Buxton was elected to parliament, Fry made use of his connec- tions to continue advocacy for better conditions for women in prison. She testified to the 1818 SC on London Prisons, the 1832 SC on Secondary Punishments and the 1835 HL SC on gaols in England and Wales to which she extolled the power of reading the Bible to ‘poor Sinners’: ‘you there see how the Gospel is exactly adapted to the fallen Condition of Man’.35 Her focus on women prisoners may have influ- enced Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel, whose Gaol Act (1823) ensured women prisoners were cared for by women wardens. Although the Gaol Act had many limitations, it was a step in the right direction, particularly in attempting to ensure there was classification of prisoners and efforts to provide them with employment.36 Seeking more evidence to support the cause, in 1819 Fry accompanied her brother, Joseph John Gurney (1788–1847) on a tour of prisons in Scotland and Northern England.37
 Fry’s major contribution to the practice of reformed transportation was to secure more effective surveillance of their conditions at every point of the journey from prison to penal colony. Her correspondence with Backhouse, in the period shortly before his departure for Australia, was focussed on securing this oversight. During the voyage, she hoped to reinforce the transformation of women’s characters she had initiated at Newgate, by providing meaningful work, copies of the Bible and sincere, Christian sympathy for their condition. When a transport left for Van Diemen’s Land before she had made arrangements for the employment of women, she was disappointed but undeterred. She asked Backhouse to follow up the errant vessel in the colony: ‘we think that very great good would result from an exact report of these things being taken upon the 40 Ibid., 74–75. 41 Ibid., 76. 42 Timothy Larsen, A People of One Book (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 180. 43 A Concise View of the Origin and Progress of the British Ladies Society for Promoting the Reformation of Female Prisoners (London: The Society, 1840), p. 18; Timpson,Memoirs of Mrs Elizabeth Fry, pp. 122–123.
 volume ‘may convey a measure of useful information, and excite some interest on behalf of the Aborigines, and the Emigrant and Prisoner Population of Australia’;54 and his second, African journal, would suc- ceed in exciting ‘christian [sic] interest for all classes of the inhabitants of the countries described; and he especially hopes, that it may promote the feeling of sympathy for the devoted individuals who are labouring amidst many privations, to spread the Redeemer’s kingdom’.55 To free settlers in both Australia and southern Africa, Backhouse addressed an open letter urging them to do justice to the native people, provide them with missions, and undertake moral reforms including temperance, religious assembly and family prayer.56 White settlers in Africa he urged to recog- nize the evil of slavery, which was accepted by all the Protestant churches of Europe.
 In New South Wales, Backhouse and Walker were engaged for two years by the colonial government to prepare a report ‘with a view to promote the moral and religious welfare of its inhabitants.’57 Travelling throughout the colony revealed a landscape whose natural beauty was blighted by the human degradation and misery inflicted on free and unfree colonists and Aborigines alike by the convict system. More hope- fully, but with few illusions, Backhouse reported on signs of Christian progress in the colony. Journeying from Parramatta, then the second largest town in the colony, to the Church Missionary Society station located across the Blue Mountains on the frontier in Wellington Valley, the Quaker visitors attended about ten churches, chapels, schools and missions, and held profitable religious conversations with a variety of colonial residents. The largest religious gathering they encountered was in the Anglican church in Parramatta, whose Sunday service was swollen by a compulsory congregation of 500–600 soldiers and convicts. Even in the frontier town of Bathurst there were both an Anglican and a Scotch church, with Bible and temperance associations also springing up.58 At the far limits of the British colonial empire, a budding religious infra- structure strained to keep pace with colonial settlement.59
 Under Captain Butler, from 1826 to 1829, almost no use had been made at Macquarie Harbour of solitary confinement on bread and water; instead the lash was heartily used and almost half the men (45 per cent) had been flogged. Since those times, Baylee could dem- onstrate a clear progression away from the lash and towards solitary confinement. In 1832, only nine men out of 180 in the settlement were flogged, with another sixteen sentenced to solitary confinement.72 The officers were keen to appear to the Quaker visitors as advocates for religious and reformist discipline focussed on achieving something better for the prisoners than mere punishment. Baylee, a committed Irish Protestant, approved and supported the work of John Alan Man- ton (1807–1864), the Methodist catechist who succeeded Schofield at Macquarie Harbour.73 The settlement clerk, John Douglas, provided the Quakers with the return of punishments, begging them to contact him with any queries and endorsing their whole enterprise: ‘Gentle- men – You are embarked in one of the noblest undertakings that ever influenced the human breast . . . the amelioration of a very considerable, but depraved, and lowly fallen portion of the Family of Man.’74 These favourable impressions of the colony would change under the impact of the roasting the two Quakers received at the hands of an unsympathetic press, however on the whole they admired and supported Arthur’s system and embraced its potential for reforming convicts during and on completion of their sentences.
 There were also plans for a cottage for the Protestant chaplain.91
 93 According to their census of religious profession, there were 464 prisoners who professed to be Protestants, 380 Roman Catholics and six Jews.
 Penal reform was adopted by evangelical Quakers who took up social activism at the risk of disrupting cherished Quaker principles of separ- ation from the world and quietist pursuit of the Inner Light. In their engagement with penal reform in the convict colonies, they provided a service to government with exemplary, evidence-based assessments of a working system without judgement or challenge to just authority. This was the same method devised by John Howard which led eventually to a revolutionary change in prisoners’ conditions, away from harsh physical punishment and towards internal, moral and psychological controls: solitary confinement, separate cells and the chapel at the heart of the prison. Unlike the extreme, Evangelical advocates of the separate system, Quakers showed their enlightened and utilitarian principles by also approving productive work and the efficient use of convict labour. At Port Arthur, Backhouse and Walker were pleased to see the full range of industrial opportunities being put in place. They believed that work as well as contemplation were essential for rehabilitation. Their close inspection of the penal stations in Australia led Backhouse and Walker to consider that reformation could occur in well-managed penal colonies as well as in home-based penitentiaries. The next chapter will consider the impact of Christian utilitarians much more decidedly antipathetic to transportation, who believed that it was without redeeming features and had to end.
 5 Christian Utilitarianism and Archbishop Richard Whately To the great bulk of those, therefore, who are sentenced to transportation the punishment amounts to this, that they are carried to a country whose climate is delightful, producing in profusion all the necessaries and most of the luxuries of life; that they have a certainty of maintenance, instead of an uncertainty; are better fed, clothed, and lodged, than (by honest means) . . . Whatever other advantages this system may possess, it certainly does not look like a very terrific punishment.1 (Richard Whately, 1829) ‘[L]iberal politics’ may degrade an archbishop to a state of thought and feeling not higher than that of a hangman.2 (Wiliam Maginn, 1932) The most original and startling voice in the anti-transportation debate was that of the archbishop of Dublin, Richard Whately (1787–1863). Before Whately, critics of transportation had been a marginal group, divided between utilitarians such as Bentham and his heirs (Chapter 1), or the humanitarian coalition of Evangelical Anglicans and Dissenting activists who supported the construction of penitentiaries at home (Chapter 2). It was Whately who effectively demolished the rational and moral pretensions of transportation; unlike the Evangelicals, includ- ing the Quakers (Chapter 4), he was unconvinced that religion could or should be used to reform criminals under sentence. Whately was a Liberal Anglican whose practical morality had its roots in the thinking of earlier Christian utilitarians and Scottish divines. His central import- ance was that he was a leader in a group of theologians who were admired by politicians and intellectuals, led by Lord John Russell (1792–1878), who succeeded in revitalizing the Whig party and bringing it to power in 1830. The Anglican and Evangelical ascendancy that had sustained the Tories and their penal polices was met with an incoming tide of Liberal Anglican and Dissenting reformers. This chapter traces the roots of 1 Richard Whately, ‘Transportation’, London Review, 1.1 (1829), 122. 2 [William Maginn], ‘Archbishop Whately’s Secondary Punishments Dissected’, Fraser’s Magazine, 6 (1832), 575.
 Christian Utilitarianism and Penal Reform As a moral theory, utilitarianism attracted secular and religious thinkers from across the denominational spectrum. In the form of Rational Dis- sent, it was espoused by Quakers and other Dissenters interested in penal reform; it also claimed adherents from the established church in both Scotland and England. Originating in the eighteenth-century Enlighten- ment, utilitarianism was embraced by Dissenters such as Joseph Priestley (1733–1804), orthodox Anglicans such as William Paley (1743–1805), archdeacon of Carlisle and Scottish moral philosophers such as Adam Ferguson (1723–1816) and Dugald Stewart (1754–1828).3 In politics, it was a significant element in the alliance of Whiggish reformers, including Liberal Anglicans, moderate Evangelicals, Dissenters and Catholics, who combined to oppose Tory claims to a monopoly interest in the moral state. Working together, they effectively isolated high church Anglican defenders of the Protestant constitution and facilitated the sweeping constitutional changes that included the repeal of the Test and Corpor- ation Acts (1828), Catholic Emancipation (1829) and the First Reform Act (1832).4
 Liberal Anglicans Liberal Anglicans emerged to prominence because of political changes which flowed from granting full access to the public sphere to those outside the established churches. According to Boyd Hilton, from 1828, a broad liberal coalition developed which began to absorb moder- ate Dissenters, Methodists keen to assert their loyalty and establishment roots and Congregationalists, as well as the newly enfranchised middle class including Jews, Catholics, Unitarians and Quakers who had 14 Adam Ferguson, An Essay on the History of Civil Society 8th edn (Philadelphia: A. Finsley, 1819), p. 302.
 outgrown their Radical tendencies.17 For Anglicans there was the add- itional stress of the increasing tension between the low and high church wings of the Church of England, which marginalized those in the political mainstream who abhorred the scriptural dogmatism of the low church on the one hand, and the supernaturalism of the high church on the other.18
 Reforming Anglicans looked to German philosophy and French science to expand the intellectual foundation of Anglican theology and broaden its economic, social and political relevance. Liberal Anglicans could be found at Trinity College, Cambridge; others were attracted to the move- ment in Trinity College, Dublin and in Edinburgh, where Thomas Chalmers, as we will see, shared some of their views. In Oxford, the movement was centred on Oriel College and its group of ‘Noetics’, who included John Eveleigh (1748–1814), Edward Copleston (1776–1849), Richard Whately, Thomas Arnold (1795–1842), Renn Dickson Hampden (1793–1868), Edward Hawkins (1789–1882), Baden Powell (1796–1880) and José Blanco White (1775–1841), several of whom, including Whately, went on to become bishops.19 Thomas Arnold, later headmaster of Rugby School, was something of a prophet for the move- ment, preaching an undogmatic Christianity engaged with society, as he wrote to his friend and former pupil William Greenhill: ‘Surely the one thing needful for a Christian and an Englishman to study is Christian and moral and political philosophy.’20
 While Whately was the only Noetic to interest himself in penal reform, they all argued that the moral society was one which was best for the national interest. The Noetics provided a theological reading of political and social issues which combined natural theology with political econ- omy. It was their aspiration that the Church of England should be a national church which served the interest of the people and be saved from descent into doctrinal narrowness and party conflict. Whately was deeply interested throughout his life in the proper relationship of church and state particularly in areas relating to education and philanthropy. He used his position to oppose the reformatory model of transportation, preferring that it should be abolished altogether. In a letter to his friend Ernest Hawkins, written in about 1826, Whately imagined a debate over 17 Boyd Hilton, A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People?: England, 1783–1846 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2006), p. clxxvii.

 the issue of church and state: ‘The points proposed to be altered by each of you, are, I think, precisely the same & whether, if those alterations were made, the Church & State would still be in alliance or not, would be merely a question of words.’21 Whately was a believer in the role the church had to play in the state, intellectually, morally and even politically. Very few agreed with him on the latter but he was happy to lead by example.
 With his optimistic interpretation of the potentiality of human nature, Chalmer’s views are closer to the moderate utilitarianism of the Scottish Enlightenment and diverge from the orthodox Calvinism of the Evangelical party in both England and Scotland considered in Chapter 2. Nevertheless, Chalmers has been criticized for seeking to solve nineteenth-century social problems with eighteenth-century tools and to some degree his vision was backward-looking.24 Chalmers wanted to establish a voluntarist moral state that was permeated by principles of private benevolence and charity mobilized by the Church and focussed 21 Whately to Hawkins, c.1826 [no date], Oriel College Oxford Library, ‘Whately Letters’, 1837–1852.

 on the parish. Significantly, Chalmers did not see prison reform as a work of charity, or at least he never discussed it. If precious taxes were to be spent on schools, prisons, churches and ‘colleges of justice’, it was done ‘for the protection of society from crime and violence, and for the increase of national virtue’.25 Direct expenditure on criminals was a dead loss in terms of Chalmers’ political economy and a drain on the wealth of the country. These ideas are reflected in Presbyterian commentators on crime and transportation in the colonies, including John Dunmore Lang (1799–1878), considered shortly, and Frederick Maitland Innes, the Scottish critic of Colonel Arthur who had settled in VanDiemen’s Land.26
 Political economy has been seen as the ultimate secular philosophy of the imperial age with its leading exponents either dead or indifferent to the claims of religion.28 However, it had a significant religious character, which was entrenched through the appointment of moral theologians to the first chairs of political economy in Oxford and Dublin.29 The debates about the corn laws raised up a keen interest in the discussion of 25 Chalmers, Political Economy, p. 244. 26 Innes, ‘The Convict System of Van Diemen’s Land’, 431–449. For John Dunmore Lang’s critique of Whately, see the next section in this chapter. 27
 economic matters and gave popularity to the thought of Bentham, James Mill and David Ricardo. In 1825, the ‘extreme evangelical’ Henry Drummond endowed the Oxford Chair in Political Economy.30 Whately became its second incumbent from 1830 to 1831 and stated that he would try to bring together religious truth with political economy because it was clearly a force so powerful that it could not be left to the anti-Christians.31 Whately, who has been the subject of three biograph- ies, is a central figure in the debates about political economy, the state of Ireland and the Christian political economics he helped to found.32 As a leading figure in Oxford, and not even a bishop, he was an unlikely choice as archbishop of Dublin but accepted out of a sense of duty when offered the post by Earl Grey in March 1831, succeeding the ultra-Tory William Magee (1766–1831).33 His main qualification was that he could work with the Whigs and had the capacity to accommodate the complex- ities of Ireland’s religious landscape, something Magee lamentably failed to achieve. From this vantage, which included a seat in the House of Lords, he continued to write on an immense range of social, economic and political topics, sometimes spiced with Christian morality, some- times infused with statistics.34 In Dublin, Whately endowed a Chair in Political Economy at Trinity College and was active in debates in the House of Lords, one of a tiny number of bishops to support Grey’s Reform Bill. It is this Christian utilitarianism that he brought to the discussion of convict transportation.35
 According to his daughter Jane, Whately had been drawn to the issue of ‘Secondary Punishments’ at a time when the matter was of keen public interest, though by 1866, when Life and Correspondence of Richard Whately was published, it had all but disappeared.36 Whately’s intervention formed part of his creative refashioning of the Anglican tradition, bring- ing together utilitarianism, Liberal Anglican social theory and the new 30 Hilton, Age of Atonement, p. 42. 31 Ibid., 46. 32 William John Fitzpatrick, Memoirs of Richard Whately, 2 vols. (London: Bentley, 1864); E. Jane Whately, Life and Correspondence of Richard Whately, 2 vols. (London: Longmans, 1866); Donald H. Akenson, A Protestant in Purgatory (Hamden, CT: Archon, 1981).
 Those whom Richard Brent has labelled ‘Liberal Anglicans’ were few in number, but through Whately, and other Liberals appointed as govern- ors in the penal colonies, they were to play a major role in voicing the moral and rational objections to transportation that ultimately brought about its demise. The Liberal Anglicans included many younger men concerned to implement a moral constitutionalism, without establish- ment or sectarianism, that would enable both national and moral pro- gress.38 They were also active in Ireland.39
 From the religious point of view, the most interesting chapter is the one devoted to the repudiation of the views of the senior Anglican cleric of the colony of New South Wales, Archdeacon Broughton.76 Possibly this is because Whately felt personally rebuked by Broughton’s sugges- tion that his arguments were neither moral nor religious in character and unbecoming to a bishop. In response to this slur, Whately denied that he overlooked ‘the moral effect of religious principle in diminishing crime’, or that, by proposing an alternative punishment to that of transportation that he was attempting to ‘supersede the fear of God!’77 In response, Whately expressed himself flabbergasted, pointing to his own efforts over a number of years on what he called (with more italics) ‘the application of religion to moral conduct’.78 For Whately, there was nothing so repre- hensible as the inappropriate application of religious precepts to social issues. ‘I have long been convinced’, he stated, ‘that nothing tends so much to bring Christianity into contempt, as the representations which some of its professors give both of its doctrines and of its application’.79
 This blistering attack needs to be seen in the context of Whately’s principled intervention in Ireland, at the height of the Famine, where he cooperated with the Catholic archbishop of Dublin to create a national education system which threatened to overturn the monopoly of the established Church of Ireland. In Ireland, some of the more vitriolic attacks, which ran from 1832 to 1834, were made by John Nelson Darby (1800–1882), an Evangelical who later left the Church of Ireland to become one of the founders of the Plymouth Brethren. Donald Akenson has noted that Darby’s attacks ‘would be libellous in our own time’ but that they differed from those of other Irish clergy, especially evangelicals, simply in their extreme form.87 Darby could scarcely bring himself to refer to Whately by his title as archbishop of Dublin.88
 was that the continued privileges of Protestant establishment were as unsustainable in Ireland as they were in the British settler colonies. The polemics of the New Reformation in Ireland, like that of the so-called crime wave in New South Wales denounced by Judge Burton (Chapter 6), were driven by the will to maintain control of the public sphere by sections of the established, Protestant, episcopal church.
 A rather more temperate reaction to Whately was provided by the veteran Presbyterian minister and immigration advocate, the Rev. John Dunmore Lang.92 Against Whately’s abolitionism Lang testified, at length, to the Molesworth SC on Transportation, that transportation and private assignment in New South Wales was effective in reforming criminals.93 Transportation and Colonization was written in 1836 during a voyage to Britain to recruit clergy for the New South Wales Presbytery. He actively opposed the use of government funds to support other churches, notably the Roman Catholic error, and regarded convict labour as a resource for colonists. He respected Whately’s utilitarian principles but provided a careful rebuttal of their logical force in light of his superior knowledge of the colonial penal system. Lang argued in favour of trans- portation, suggesting that it had not been tested sufficiently since it had been been grossly mismanaged. In relation to New South Wales, he argued persuasively that it was never intended that the colony should remain exclusively penal but that convicts should pave the way for free settlers. From his own experience, he confirmed that not only was convict reformation possible, but that that he had witnessed it ‘in many instances’.94 Lang also thought that transportation was a humane punish- ment which provided criminals with ‘new scenes and new circumstances’ to break the cycle of reoffending. This he considered better than the system of hard labour and penitentiaries recommended by Whately and implemented in the United States. He deplored the outcome of the latter which resulted in a cycle of repeated offending and perpetual servitude: ‘till at last, in perfect recklessness, [the prisoner] comes to regard a prison as his home and his country; – and the hopeless condition of his existence, that of enmity towards the whole human race’.95
 transportation, which involved their distribution across the continent and among a large body of free setters, had been so successful in reformation that all traces of convict origins had dissipated long ago.96 He rebutted two of Whately’s misconceptions about transportation, firstly that it had failed to reform convicts, and secondly that it could not be made profit- able. On reform, he asserted that what was lacking was simply the effective implementation of a more punitive regime, focussed on using the resource of convict labour to benefit the colonization of new lands, especially in northern Australia. But the most important change needed was to switch to support for the arrival of a ‘free emigrant and virtuous population, to afford the requisite stimulus to reformation, and to repress the general tendency to criminality’.97 All convict labour should be devoted to clearing land with profits invested to support free emigrants, providing them at the same time with a clergyman and a schoolmaster for every one hundred families.98
 colonies, including those of Britain (1833);102 Whately’s Thoughts on Secondary Punishments (1833); and the Reports from the SC on Secondary Punishments (1831 and 1832). Grey began by situating penal reforms as part of the triumphant achievements of the Whig reformist government. Both Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform were stages in the ‘one great struggle’ which had progressively seen the transfer of power from the few to ‘the people at large’.103 Having achieved ‘the ascendancy of the oligarchical principle’, it remained to try and disentangle the grip on power of the established elite. This was achieved first in Ireland, with the Catholic Relief Bill, and then the expansion of the electorate. But for Grey, the next logical step was to look to improve the quality of life for everyone: ‘how that power might best be used for the welfare of the whole community’.104 The two areas that he singled out as most in need of reform were the poor laws and the legal system. In relation to transpor- tation, Grey thought that the high price of labour in the colonies ensured that most prisoners benefitted from it, demonstrated by the fact that very few returned. However, while this was an advantage of the system to Britain, it was not a punishment.105 Grey went on to suggest that con- victs should be required to cover all the costs incurred by their incarcer- ation. Opposing excessive rigour, he argued that in order to make transportation an effective remedy for the reformation of criminals it should become, ‘an indulgence granted to them at their own desire’.106
 Oriel College, to find a pathway between the secular utilitarians on the one hand, and the birth of the Oxford movement and its radical swing to tradition on the other. Whately was a champion of rational solutions to social problems and his views on transportation were enthusiastically taken up by the Radical Whigs, such as Molesworth, for the much more strongly expressed condemnation of transportation by the Select Com- mittee which he chaired. Molesworth skilfully manipulated witnesses to the Select Committee, including Anglican, Presbyterian and Catholic clergy, to bolster support for his move to abolish convict transportation to New South Wales. This was to continue a campaign which had been initiated by Jeremy Bentham but which had not succeeded, in part because of doubts by mainstream politicians about the religious implica- tions of what seemed to be a godless solution to a moral problem.
 Whately was not afraid to speak his mind and have his opinions appear in print, which he originally feared would hold back his career. In 1826, he wrote to Ernest Hawkins that he thought this was worth the risk: ‘I have not put myself at the head of a school or party; I have proclaimed no new discovery; I have coveted neither wealth nor honor, but have, with my eyes open, shut myself out from both.’114 In the case of transporta- tion, his influence was substantial. He was the most distinguished intel- lectual to address the question of transportation since Bentham in 1812.115 Whately’s entry into the debate and his principled rebuttal of the arguments put in favour of transportation by Bishop Broughton and Colonel Arthur gave the opponents of transportation the opportunity to resume the moral high ground. Whately’s arguments were internally convincing, however they were effectively combatted from three direc- tions, by the home government represented by the third Earl Grey, from colonial authorities such as Colonel Arthur, and from those with experi- ence of the practical reformation of convicts, including the Rev. John Dunmore Lang. Evidently there was still considerable life left in trans- portation, though the call for reform was now more strident than ever. If rational arguments could not overthrow transportation, another strategy was to appeal to the emotions and sympathies of the moral middle class. The next chapter considers the ways in which Catholic reformers, includ- ing Father Ullathorne and Bishop Willson, led a humanitarian and reli- gious denunciation of the ‘horrors of transportation’, and how Catholic claims for entry into the moral realm were resisted by defenders of the Protestant establishment.
 6 Catholics, Protestants and the ‘Horrors of Transportation’ They look for death, as those who dig for treasure, and it cometh not; they are exceedingly rejoiced when they have found a grave.1 (Ullathorne, 1837) A cage of unclean birds, full of crimes against God and Man, of Murders, Blasphemies, and all Uncleanness.2 (Judge Burton, 1840) The ‘horrors of transportation’ was a term that originated with the writing of the Rev. William Bernard Ullathorne (1806–1889) when serving as Roman Catholic (hereafter Catholic) Vicar General of New South Wales. It was given greater prominence through his testimony to the Molesworth SC on Transportation. Originally preached by Ullathorne to warn poor Irish Catholics of the dangers of courting conviction as a way out of poverty, ‘the horrors of transportation’ soon entered popular discourse in other forms. In England, the Molesworth SC provided a vehicle by which Gothic elaborations of convict demoralization were woven together with traditional Catholic teaching on the purgatorial suffering of the damned and conservative Protestant fears of Catholic incursion on the moral realm. In the penal colony, fears of a calamitous rise in crime were stoked by Judge William Westbrooke Burton (1794–1888) from his bully pulpit in the New South Wales Supreme Court. Burton and Ullathorne would go on to engage in a sparring match over the relative number and moral status of Catholics in the colony and who should receive funding to run schools, churches and provide religious instruc- tion to convicts.

 Despite a rich historiography concerning Irish convict transportation, less has been said about Catholic convicts, the great majority of them Irish, and their clergy in the penal colonies.3 Stoked by civil and foreign war, anti- Catholicism was essential to Britain’s Protestant identity and formed an aspect of the British imperial state.4 This mattered in the first decades of the nineteenth century, when the pressure of high levels of Catholic emigration from Ireland challenged liberal initiatives to remove faith-based civil dis- abilities from British citizens. Based on the available data on religion, British and Irish Catholics were over represented in English, Scottish and Irish prisons, as they were in penal colonies and convict establishments with significant Irish flows.5 According to parliamentary returns published in 1852–1853, Catholics made up 13.7 per cent of the English, 90 per cent of the Irish and 18.5 per cent of the Scottish prison population (see Tables 6.1 and 6.2); compared with the 1851 census of religious worship 3 For Irish convicts, see Simon Devereaux, ‘Irish Convict Transportation and the Reach of the State in Late Hannoverian Britain’, Journal of the Canadian Historical Association 8.1 (1997), 61–85; Bob Reece, The Origins of Irish Convict Transportation to New South Wales (Houndmills: Palgrave, 2001) Hamish Maxwell-Stewart, ‘“And all my great hardships endured”?: Irish Convicts in Van Diemen’s Land, in Nial Whelehan (ed.), Transnational Perspectives in Modern Irish History (London: Routledge, 2015), pp. 69–87.

 with 8 per cent and 4.5 per cent for England and Wales and Scotland respectively and 78 per cent in Ireland, according to the 1861 census (see Table 6.3). Despite the high numbers of Catholic convicts, religious provi- sion per prisoner was below that provided for Protestants, particularly in Ireland (see Table 6.3),6 and this became a matter of contention in the penal colonies.
 At first blush, Catholic clerics’ assertive denunciation of the ‘horrors of transportation’ appears surprising. Throughout the nineteenth century, the Church of Rome displayed entrenched social and political conserva- tism and preached passive acceptance of poverty, the authority of secular rulers and the unequal distribution of goods and power. Yet penal reform had made strides in enlightened Catholic states, including the papacy itself. In 1703, Pope Clement XI founded Rome’s first prison, the hospice of San Michele (Ospizio Apostolico di San Michele a Ripa), which provided delinquent boys with a work regime by day and private cells for rest and contemplation by night. Visiting in 1778, John Howard found SanMichele ‘sadly neglected’, but approved the seminary founded by Pope Clement XII in 1735 for young women on the same principles.8
 The Catholic prison which most attracted the interest of British penal reformers was the Ghent Maison de Force (House of Correction) or Octagon in Catholic Belgium. Designed by Flemish magistrate Count Jean Philippe Vilain in 1773, it incorporated religious discipline, silence, classification and separation of prisoners and a work regime alongside training for a trade and education. In 1817 the Society for the Diffusion of Knowledge upon the Punishment of Death and the Improvement of Prison Discipline published a detailed report of it, noting some decline in conditions since Howard’s day.9 When Buxton visited, it was still one of 6 Although Catholics made up 89.9 per cent of the prison population, only 48.8 per cent of salaries were paid to Catholic prison chaplains and religious instructors (Table 6.3).

 This political and theological context informed the steady advocacy of Catholic clergy appointed to the penal colonies for Catholic prisoners under sentence. From the beginning of their appointments to New South Wales, Vicar General Ullathorne and Vicar Apostolic Polding relished a mission to the convict population.14 Ullathorne engaged defenders of the Protestant ascendancy in the colony, including the Rev. Henry Fulton, Archdeacon Broughton and Judge Burton of the Supreme Court.15 Of those promoting colonial Protestantism, Burton had an appetite for controversy and wrote at the greatest length.16 Before coming to New 10 Buxton, An Inquiry, pp. 83–89. 11 Andrew Scotnicki, Criminal Justice and the Catholic Church (Plymouth: Sheed & Ward, 2008).

 South Wales he had served in the navy and trained as a barrister, going out to the Cape as second puisne judge of the Supreme Court in 1827. In New South Wales, anti-Catholic and anti-liberal polemic never achieved the level of vitriol directed against liberals like Archbishop Whately on issues such as government support for a national system of non-sectarian education for Catholic children in Ireland.17 However, the flames were fanned by the same ultra-Protestant world view in which Catholics were seen as agents of Anti-Christ, the papacy as the whore of Babylon and the defence of the British moral empire as the exclusive duty and privilege of the national, Protestant church. Underlying sectarianism ensured that the debate about transportation was fought with pugnacious intensity.
 Witnesses were interrogated about Burton’s claims for the rise in capital crime and the dearth of religious provision in the colony.20 According to the Rev. John West, ‘nothing so powerfully contributed to rouse the attention of the empire’ to the evils of transportation and its impact on the colony as this speech.21 Burton’s ‘charge’ summarized the capital crimes from 1833 to 1835, including 399 capital convictions and 229 executions. He claimed, ‘It would seem as if the main business of all the community were the commission of crime and the punishment of it – as if 17 Akenson, Protestant in Purgatory; See Chapter 5. 18 Burton to Bourke, 2 December 1835, Bourke Papers, Miscellaneous 1831–1838, SLNSW MLMSS 404–411.

 Nevertheless, the damage was done; the image of the colony mired in a morass of moral filth chimed with the dismal Evangelical view of convict society, which had changed little since Wilberforce’s denunciations prior to the Bigge Commission.31 It effectively countermanded the rising demands of Dissenting and Catholic colonists for a say in the governance of the colony as a free, moral state without an established church.32
 Liberals like Bourke were optimistic about the colony, though con- cerned about the need for greater religious provision, distinguishing themselves by believing that this should be distributed according to need to Anglicans, Dissenters and Catholics alike. Meanwhile, Ullathorne had both the ear of the Governor and the sympathetic support of the Colonial Office. Writing to Lord Glenelg in June 1836, Ullathorne argued that the moral standing of the penal colony of Van Diemen’s Land would only improve with more resident Catholic clergy, paid for by the government, to cater for the 5,000 Catholics in Van Diemen’s Land, many of them convicts. Requesting an additional five clergymen, Ullathorne blamed the ‘crimes and disorders’ of the Catholics of Van Diemen’s Land on their religious deprivation, which, when remedied, might be expected to work a marvellous change, promising: Property would become more secure; habitual concubinage would give place to marriage and domestic order; drunkenness, that paralysis of the colony, would be diminished in its causes; the sanctity of an oath would be better understood and observed; and the children, on whose education the reformation of the colony mainly depends, would have better guides and instructors than the bad example of vicious parents.33
 Burton, on the other hand, believed that more Anglican churches, clergy and schools were the only way to counter the terrible evils of the colony reflected in atrocities such as the massacre on the Liverpool Plains, ‘far out of the reach of the laws, and uninfluenced by Reli- gion’.36 Addressing those accused of the 1838 Myall Creek massacre, who included both convicts and former convicts, Burton stated: ‘I do not think that Christian men, men speaking the English language, could have brought themselves to the commission of this crime.’37 As Gipps noted, all eleven of those hanged for the massacre arrived in the colony as convicts, reflecting the compromised morality of a penal colony.38
 Burton wanted a union of the laws of God and man to prevent any recurrence of the atrocity. For the convicts, he suggested appointing equal numbers of itinerating clergy and police magistrates and the provision of public worship and religious instruction for ‘every Gaol, Factory, Ironed gang, and Road party’.40 To pay for it, he proposed directing the substantial funds released by the dissolution of the [Angli- can] Clergy and School Estates Corporation, under Governor Bourke’s Church Act of 1836. He opposed provision for the Catholic Church, arguing that it was already too successful, securing converts through its ministry to male prisoners, including those counselled prior to execu- tions or, in the case of the women convicts supported by the Sisters of Charity, who chose to baptize their ‘numerous illegitimate children’ as Catholics.41 Burton was especially galled by Bishop Polding’s laying of the foundation for a new Catholic church at Windsor, dressed 35 Ullathorne to Glenelg, 8 February 1837, Ibid., p. 17. Father John Brady was selected for this position.
 ‘in his full Canonicals’, accompanied by a military band.42 Burton had greater tolerance for the Presbyterian Church, established in Scotland, but none for Dissenters whom he derided as flourishing largely because of the absence of a sufficiently endowed ‘National Church’. This had left the colony a ‘great Moral Wilderness’ where both Catholics and Dissenters rose up like weeds.43 ‘In this’, Burton opined, ‘an injury was done to the National Church, and to the common cause of True Religion’.44 On these points, Burton was promoting a cause that had been swept away by the New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land Church Acts.
 Maconochie’s mark system be given a trial (Chapter 7), at least until well-constructed penitentiaries were erected in Britain. It further recom- mended, following Maconochie, that no one be sent to a penitentiary for life, ‘as such punishment destroys all hope, and renders the culprit reckless’.63 In order to make Maconochie’s system more effective it was proposed that it be married to the hardy nostrum of greater religious instruction. Apart from the latter aspiration, none of the six final recom- mendations were religious in nature, but the Committee supported Evangelical models of penal reform, including separation, classification and religious instruction.64 This was a more secular inquiry than previous committees and most witnesses who testified were laypeople, including former colonial administrators such as Colonel Arthur.65 The three clergy who provided evidence were the Rev. Henry Bishop (c.1800–1857), a commissioner of the Poor Law Inquiry, John Dunmore Lang, Presbyter- ian minister and emigration advocate and Ullathorne, Catholic Vicar General of New South Wales. There was considerable attention given to religion in the voluminous appendix to the report, including a letter from Richard Whately, which was put into evidence by Bishop.66
 including Lt Governor John Franklin, Mr Joseph Orton (1795–1842), superintendent of the Wesleyan Mission, John Lillie (1806–1866), mod- erator of the Van Diemen’s Land Presbytery, William Hutchins (1792–1841), first Anglican archdeacon of Van Diemen’s Land and Frederick Miller (1806–62) and Charles Price (1807–1891) on behalf of the Congregational Union. ‘We readily attest’, Miller and Price affirmed, ‘that as regards social order and decorum, and a disposition to sanction and support the institutions of religion, the free population of this colony will not suffer from comparison . . . [with] any part of the mother country’.70 There was one significant omission from this list; there was no Catholic representative. Ullathorne could not join in the outrage of the colonists because he had testified to the Molesworth SC and was held to be complicit in its findings.
 Sensitive to his Catholic and mostly Irish audience, Ullathorne evoked a penal time, equivalent to the persecution of the early Christian martyrs, the English Catholics during the Reformation or in Ireland under British occupation, when the Catholic population was denied the comforts of true religion. He denounced the physical torments inflicted by Protestant clergy in the penal colonies: ‘Clerical magistrates, of another creed, awarded him the scourge and darksome imprisonment for refusing to enter the protestant churches, and to mingle in a worship which his conscience disowned.’103 Arthur’s regime in Van Diemen’s Land was depicted as ‘a scene of absolute destitution’ for Catholics: ‘The Governor was a man of a pious turn of mind, who thought religion and education of the utmost value to everyone but a Catholic.’104 Perhaps this remark prompted Arthur to provide his minute iteration of religious services for different denominations, which included more provision for Catholics than Ullathorne alleged.105 To back his case, Ullathorne implied that the proportion of Catholics was systematically understated by the govern- ment, something strongly disputed by Judge Burton.106 Using skills honed as a missionary preacher, Ullathorne invoked the cadences of penitential prayer familiar to his Catholic readers and listeners. As the natural climax of the pamphlet, Ullathorne included twenty-two convict 101 Ullathorne, Catholic Mission, p. 55. 102 Ibid., 56–57.

 how rarely it moved prisoners to contrition, self-knowledge, or ‘refor- mation’ by either civil or ecclesiastical authority.161
 In the first decades of the nineteenth century, the relatively high numbers of Catholic prisoners in British and Irish penal institutions reflected their history of social and economic deprivation and exclusion from political power and administrative authority. Their increasing visibility and spirit- ual, economic and political needs attracted the attention of missionaries and benefactors in the course of which the convict system represented a frontier in centuries of religious hostilities. While sectarianism was part of the anti-transportation campaign from the beginning, it was most evident in the tussles over the liberal expansion of provision to Irish Catholic convicts in New South Wales and later, as discussed in Chapter 10, the hulks of Bermuda. Catholic theology of punishment and retribution, as much as innovations in prison and penal theory, provided ample grounds for the development of an alternative, Catholic discourse of the ‘horrors of transportation’, outlined in this chapter.
 Ullathorne’s motivation in condemning the horrors of transportation was the simple one of seeking to educate those who had been misled about the reality of a punishment that, in his view, was harsh, degrading and removed all respect and dignity from the human person. His other objective was to encourage candidates to the Catholic mission in New South Wales. For this purpose, it was important that the situation of the convicts be seen to arise as much from the iniquities of the British penal system as from any fault of the Irish prisoners. Ullathorne was not Irish but he seems to have been adept in adapting narratives of Irish resistance to British oppression to the particular purpose of the mission to New South Wales. This adaptation was to have a power far beyond what Ullathorne might have anticipated. His narrative would be embraced by free and unfree Irish and denounced by the Protestant colonists as deceitful and degrading to their own view of their role in building a moral colony in the southern seas. At a time when there were limited avenues to express a liberal Catholic interpretation of penal reform, Ullathorne’s preaching underpinned resistance to the religious and political establishment.
 The ‘horrors of transportation’ were critical to a political moment in the anti-transportation campaign, shortly before, during and after the bringing down of the Molesworth Report with which it is intimately connected. For very different reasons, humanitarian and sectarian advo- cates, including Catholic and ultra-Protestant Evangelicals in the col- onies, found it convenient to exaggerate the moral challenges created by convict transportation. The polemical and popular narratives they deployed fed into long-standing scriptural narratives, reflecting Catholic and Protestant theologies of penance and suffering, as well as popular tropes of the returning penitent. Judge Burton’s charge to the jury, which represented New South Wales as sinking in a pit of crime and vice, was inaccurate but explicable in the light of Evangelical assertions for the established church to dominate the moral realm, including its courts, prisons, schools and other public institutions. For Burton it provided grounds to oppose the efforts of the liberal government committed to dismantling the exclusive privileges of the Church of England. From very different premises, Ullathorne’s depiction of the ‘horrors of transporta- tion’ was an indictment of the treatment of Irish Catholic prisoners by British authorities whom he represented as indifferent to their spiritual and physical wellbeing. For this reason, Catholic writers, following in the footsteps of Ullathorne, as well as McEncroe and Willson on Norfolk Island,162 have tended to embrace the convict experience, with all its horrors, as part of their own national story.
 No prospect being afforded them of ever again being blest with the enjoyment of Woman’s love, without hope of Heaven or fear of Hell, their already darkened reason became more clouded, their lax morals gave way and they indulged with apparent delight in every filthy and unnatural propensity.1 (Thomas Cook, 1841–1843) I found the Island a turbulent brutal hell, and I left it a peaceful well- ordered community.2 (Captain Maconochie, 1848) In 1848, the penal reformer Captain AlexanderMaconochie (1787–1860) published a defence of the system he had implemented for the reform of prisoners on Norfolk Island, the most infamous penal settlement in the empire, claiming: ‘I found the Island a turbulent brutal hell, and I left it a peaceful, well-ordered community.’3 While claims for demonic condi- tions and heroic agency are common in tales of penal reform, Macono- chie’s contribution has been more controversial than most, more so even than Colonel Arthur’s, considered in Chapter 3. Maconochie attracted both admirers and detractors in the course of his career, including many religious-minded supporters. Yet Maconochie’s own motivation for engagement in penal reform remains somewhat opaque. He denounced those Evangelicals who attempted to use religion and physical suffering to secure the reformation of the criminal. However, he was not a secular Benthamite whose faith in a rational system of rewards and penalties served the sole purpose of reducing the burden of crime to the state. Rather he was heir to the Christian utilitarianism espoused by Paley and Whately, though transmitted through Scottish Presbyterian rather than English Anglican liberalism.
 Two important changes to the condition of the island occurred in the wake of the Molesworth Report. First, Captain Maconochie was engaged to make a trial of his social system of convict management. At more or less the same time, permanent Protestant and Catholic chaplains arrived Table 7.1 Resident clergy on Norfolk Island, 1836–1850
 Maconochie gave particular attention to building the prisoners’ reli- gious sensibilities, with the important distinction from earlier regimes that he was religiously tolerant and demanded the same tolerance of chaplains serving on the island. In this, Maconochie was marching very much to the hymn sheet of the outgoing Governor, Sir Richard Bourke, who had implemented the New South Wales Church Act providing parity of state support to the four largest religious denominations in the colony. Norfolk Island acquired a Protestant and a Catholic chapel, which Fr McEncroe would dedicate to St Vincent, apostle of the French galley slaves.64 Neither chapel was approved by the government, but Maconochie built them anyway. A detailed description of the Catholic chapel indicates that it was richly decorated, almost certainly with Maco- nochie’s subvention: the windows were filled with transparencies, ‘per- fect imitations of stained glass’ depicting scenes from the life of Christ and Joshua Reynolds’ figures of Faith and Hope (originally designed for windows in New College Chapel, Oxford).65 There were over twenty large pictures taken from ‘our national gallery’, including reproductions of works by masters such as Gentileschi, Rubens, Van Dyck, Titian, Guercino, Raphael and Eustache Le Sueur. One of the more modern pieces was Jean-Baptiste Regnault’s Le Déluge (1789), now in the Louvre, an eerie masterpiece depicting a man carrying his aged parent on his back and a woman desperately lifting up a child in a vain attempt to escape the 63 Maddox, ‘On the Machinery of Moral Improvement’. 64 Cullen, ‘Norfolk Island: Its Catholic Story’. 65 Alumnus, ‘Catholic Church Norfolk Island’, Australasian Chronicle, 10 (12 August 1841), p. 2. ‘Alumnus’ is possibly the Rev.

 rising flood.66 There was also a convict choir and devout congregation of officers and prisoners, with full credit given to Maconochie, ‘indefatig- able in carrying out his views of reform, and at the same time showing a wise regard for the equal claims and rights of conscience of the several denominations’.67 Maconochie says he attended services at both Protest- ant and Catholic chapels. The Norfolk Island diary of the Rev. Thomas Sharpe suggests the hostility created by this even-handed approach for Protestants with strongly held anti-Catholic views.68
 The pencil sketches Naylor left behind of his garden on Norfolk Island suggests his time there was fruitful artistically as well as spiritually.80 Like other ordained ministers engaged as religious instructors under the pro- bation system, he felt strongly the loss of status and autonomy by his subordination to the Comptroller General of Convicts rather than the appropriate ecclesiastical authority, discussed in Chapter 8. He felt forced to resign, but did not let the matter rest. As with other Norfolk Island chaplains, Naylor took his revenge by writing a denunciation of 73 Rev. T. B. Naylor Papers, May 1829–30 June 1849, SLNSWDLMS 134, DLMSQ 363. 74
 While encouraging his social system and building moral improvement, through music, theatre, self-expression (he also encouraged convicts to write their memoirs) and religion, Maconochie denounced the principles of the ‘separate system’, especially its reliance on pain, suffering and social isolation. This he dismissed as a fundamental flaw: ‘Men are utterly helpless in its grasp; – they thus make excellent prisoners; – and those who manage, and those who view, them in this position, are thus 87 E. Strickland, The Australian Pastor: A Record of the Remarkable Changes in Mind and Outward State of Henry Elliott (London: Wertheim, Macintosh & Hunt, 1862).
 The clergy who worked with Maconochie on Norfolk Island had a range of views about his experiment. Most Protestant convict chaplains were strongly anti-Catholic and those who offered themselves for Norfolk Island seem to have been so intensely. The Rev. Thomas Sharpe was unable to tolerate Maconochie’s liberal regime and was dismissed in 1840.122 In his diary Sharpe accused the Catholic chaplains of a ‘mania’ for inflating their numbers, aided by the Commandant: ‘I am sorry to see how highly favoured the priests of Rome are by the present Govern- ment.’123 Sharpe blamedMaconochie’s social system for offences against the Sabbath and a tide of antinomian excess among the prisoners: ‘As liberalism has advanced among them, the fear of doing wrong has van- ished, and, the dread of punishment being taken away, they exult in their evil deeds without restraint.’124 He was horrified when Maconochie attended a Roman Catholic service, appalled that a Protestant would sanction ‘the awful apostacy of their fallen Church’.125 Although Captain Maconochie also attended his services with his wife and ensured the construction of an attractive Protestant church, Sharpe remained implac- ably hostile to his methods: ‘Religion has little to do with the boasted new System, but amusements much.’126 Also finding sectarian solace in writing, the Catholic chaplain, John McEncroe, enlivened his sojourn on the island by completing a popular guide to heresies, including those of Protestant apostates such as Martin Luther, Thomas Müntzer and John Calvin: ‘If these men were sent by our blessed Saviour to reform his church, founded by the Apostles, there must have been a most extraor- dinary change in the ways of Providence.’127
 For the first time in the history of mankind reformation has been adopted as the principle of penal discipline.1 (Herald of Tasmania, 1845) I regret to state my impression that after all the stress laid upon the necessity of providing adequately for the religious and moral instruction of the Convict under the New System, in no particular has the difficulty of attaining the object been more glaringly apparent.2 (La Trobe, 1847) After the abolition of private assignment under transportation, religious engagement intensified for most prisoners, from silence and separation in Britain’s penitentiaries to religious instruction and work in the proba- tion stations abroad. In the penal colonies a period of experimentation in reformative transportation began, through which convicts would work, pray and be guided to better lives, at least in theory. Recent historians are sceptical about this process; Philip Harling, for one, notes that from 1840, the probation system constituted an attempt to ‘moralize’ the convicts to make them acceptable to the colonists.3 The protracted end to convict transportation is thus considered a largely hypocritical attempt to avoid the expense of alternatives such as penal servitude in modern penitentiaries for British prisoners at home. This was the view of Radicals and utilitarians, Christian and secular, who believed the argument about transportation had been won and lost by Whately, Molesworth and his SC on Transportation. Yet this ignores the religious commitment and integrity of reformers in government and colonial administration, who continued to see merit in reformative schemes of penal exile.
 Probation was intimately connected with Pentonville. Opened in 1842 as a national prison, Pentonville emerged as part of a raft of social, legal and religious reforms promoted by the Whig administration of Lord John Russell, which continued the shift away from death or exile and towards reform and incarceration in punishment.4 Designed by military engineer Major Joshua Jebb and set behind massive walls on its own six-acre site, Pentonville was among the most significant investments in social capital of the Victorian age. Lauded by reformers, ridiculed by satirists such as Thomas Carlisle (1795–1881) and Dickens, endlessly visited and com- mented on by contemporaries, in the 1970s radical historians, including Michael Ignatieff, represented it as the emblem of the repressive, per- verted religiosity of the penitentiary movement.5 Even its labour was designed to be cruelly pointless. Whatever the justice of this representa- tion, and it has been subject to considerable revision by historians dis- agreeing with Ignatieff and Michel Foucault,6 Pentonville, together with Parkhurst, was the most highly regulated prison ever built in England. By 4 Clive Emsley, Crime and Society in England, 1750–1900 5th edn (Harlow: Longman, 2018), pp. 284–285; Radzinowicz, English Criminal Law, vol. 4, pp. 316–326.
 Graham (1792–1861) in December 1842,13 required the chaplain to be an ordained member of the Church of England, licensed by the bishop of London for the purpose.14 At 400 pounds, his salary was substantially higher than that of gaol chaplains received elsewhere in England and Wales in 1835.15 Like Millbank before it, Pentonville was a moral Panopticon (Bentham’s term for the all-seeing supervisory chamber of his prison machine),16 with the chaplain, in partnership with the gov- ernor, at its apex. While from the start objections were made concerning Pentonville’s authoritarian character, one of its leading principles was the replacement of all other forms of physical punishment with labour, religious instruction and solitude. The social commentator Henry Mayhew (1812–1887), who was well aware of the objections to the regime at Pentonville, including the high risk of psychiatric damage posed by total silence and separation, nevertheless preferred it to the alternatives, including Maconochie’s mark system.17
 Although inspired by American models, Pentonville’s separate system, which was followed by transportation and probation in the penal col- onies, was distinct from systems of penal discipline tried elsewhere.18
 As colonial secretary in Lord Melbourne’s Whig administration, Russell was chiefly responsible for the launch of the probation system and its distinctive religious format. Educated at the University of Edinburgh, Russell’s utilitarian sympathies and latitudinarian religious convictions favouring the established Church of England found expression in his approach to legal and prison reform.40 Sitting on the Molesworth Com- mittee, he was moved by those who testified before him, further con- vinced that social problems could be addressed by tackling underlying economic constraints on trade. Russell has been called, after Gladstone, that, in the absence of transportation, ‘It’s no use trying to repent here.’ For Clay’s views of the mark system, see Chapter 7.
 ‘the most fervent and religious prime minister of the Victorian age’.41 In his Essays on the Christian Religion, completed when he had left public life, Russell opposed Calvinists and Puritans and the errors of Rome, declar- ing: ‘of all the churches which may be called established, or which count among their adherents a great national community, the Church of Eng- land is that which follows with the most fidelity the spirit of the Gospel’.42
 In his ‘Regulations for the Religious andMoral Instruction of Convicts in Van Diemen’s Land’, Forster wrote that ‘A change in moral character is the only solid ground upon which the restoration of the convict to society can be advantageous; and this result depends very considerably upon the zealous and persevering exertions that are made for his reformation, and for bringing him under the influence of religion.’52 The guidelines guar- anteed freedom of worship for the prisoners, and access to secular and religious instruction. By the time of his second report to Franklin in January 1845, Forster regretted these liberal arrangements, noting that ‘much that might be done’ if only all the religious instructors had been ordained ministers of the Church of England was in disarray. There was no unity among the religious instructors because they had such different educational and theological attainments.53
 Diemen’s Land.62 Having succeeded Franklin in 1843, on 30 April 1846 Eardley Wilmot was dismissed by the rising William Ewart Gladstone (1809–1898), who had succeeded Stanley as colonial secre- tary in December 1845, for incompetence and unspecified moral fail- ings.63 Gladstone accused him of neglecting his core duty of ‘impressing deeply a moral and reformatory character upon convict management’.64 His informants are likely to have been Bishop Nixon and Archdeacon Marriott, who was then in England.65 Defending Table 8.3 Sums paid out of the military chest to clergymen in New South Wales, 1838

 Roman Catholic clergy were appointed to serve on convict ships leaving Ireland from 1848 to 1852, but they encountered significant problems.77 Following a report from the Catholic Vicar General of the Melbourne diocese, Patrick Geoghehan (1805–1864), who had himself travelled out to the colony on the London in December 1850, attempts to ‘assimilate the Irish and English convict service’ in this manner were discontinued.78 Like Bishop Nixon, Geoghehan objected to the loss of status suffered by ordained clergy from being designated ‘religious instructors’ rather than ‘chaplains’ and the effective secularization this entailed. It was hoped that the appointment of Catholic instructors would compensate Irish prisoners for the absence of penitentiary training in Ireland, but priests had neither the will nor capacity to effect the required transformation on the voyage. A memo complained that 73 Shaw, Convicts and the Colonies, p. 123. 74 Beth Palmer and Adelene Buckland, A Return to the Common Reader: Print Culture and the Novel, 1850–1900 (Farnham: Ashgate, 2011), p. 112. Palmer states that Browning undertook nine voyages, Bateson, Convict Ships, p. 410 notes seven, two to New South Wales: Margaret three in 1840, Hashemy in 1849; and five to Van Diemen’s Land: Arab I in 1833, Elphinstone I in 1836, Earl Grey three in 1843, and Mount Stewart Elphinstone I in 1845, and Hashemy I in 1849 (which went to New South Wales not Port Philip).
 regardless of their respectability, which was not in doubt, Catholic clergy were ‘liable to gross imposition’ by the prisoners.79
 A significant additional complication was the elevation of the first Anglican bishop of Tasmania, Francis Russell Nixon (1803–1879), one of five colonial bishops consecrated in Westminster on 25 August 1842. Bishop Nixon arrived in Hobart in July 1843, accompanied by his wife and family, Fitzherbert Adams Marriott (1811–1890), who became arch- deacon of Hobart, and other clergy.80 Nixon was well endowed with funding from the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund (1841), the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and, within two years, a gift of £5,000 specif- ically for missions to convicts.81 Like the late Archdeacon Hutchins, Nixon was strongly opposed to the continued reliance of Methodists to serve penal establishments in Van Diemen’s Land and made intemperate claims for the extent of his episcopal authority. In confidential corres- pondence with Stanley, Eardley Wilmot explained his difficulty with Bishop Nixon’s demand for ecclesiastical nomination of all chaplains to gaols.82 Nixon informed Stanley that he would not licence or ordain any chaplains to convicts since they were under civil authority.83 In a com- promise that satisfied no one, Stanley appointed Marriott, ‘superintend- ent of convict chaplains’, which Nixon regarded as further undermining his episcopal authority. In a letter which may not have sent but reflected his thinking, Nixon accused Eardley Wilmot of giving admittance to Government House to ladies ‘provided they are young & pretty and have no objection to the philandering attentions of an elderly Gentleman’.84
 Mrs Nixon confided to her journal in September 1844 that ‘Sir Eardley is no friend of the Church’ and that ‘Everyone agreed that the probation system will be the entire ruin of the Colony’.85 Nixon resolutely signed a mass petition for the abolition of the probation system presented to Eardley Wilmot,86 while the Rev. Henry Phibbs Fry (1807?–1874), 79 ‘Minute as to the grounds on which the sending out R. Catholic clergymen as instructors on Convict Ships has been discontinued’, 13 September 1852, NLI Mayo Papers, MS 11,183 (item 3).
 While colonial authorities were well aware of problems with probation, including the serious deficiency in the provision of both Protestant and Catholic religious instructors,88 the Colonial Office first acknowledged the scale of the problem after receiving a series of irrefutable reports from well-placed settlers and religious authorities, led by Bishop Nixon and Archdeacon Marriott in Van Diemen’s Land. Referring to the collapse in demand for convict labour as well as the ‘moral condition of the convict population’, Lord Stanley warned in February 1845 that transportation was becoming a ‘very serious embarrassment’.89 In August 1846, Earl Grey provided Cabinet with a detailed history by Thomas Murdoch which was more explicit, reporting of ‘facts of so alarming and horrible a character’, that immediate action was essential.90 At issue were the mass congregation of men in gangs with little effective supervision and few signs of reformation in response to the all-important religious or moral instruction. These fed on longstanding anxieties about male and female convict (and slave) sexuality, including promiscuity, cross-racial pollution and the threat of unions between free and unfree settlers.91
 The religious element of the probation system required a significant number of newly appointed religious instructors and other clerical per- sonnel. Given the longstanding shortage of clergy willing to work with convicts, this was always going to present a challenge. Even with the passing of the Church Acts, religious provision was focussed on tendering to free colonists rather than convicts. In 1837 a parliamentary return listed just two colonial inquiries relating to clergy for convicts in New South Wales, namely Ullathorne’s request of a Catholic chaplain for Norfolk Island and Broughton’s that colonial chaplains receive free passage in return for providing religious services to convicts on the voyage.101 Convict religious need was recognized by the Church Act (1836) which allowed masters to include their convict servants when making a case for an officiating minister.102 Once in the colony, few qualified ministers showed interest in working in convict establishments. The situation in Van Diemen’s Land was slightly better than in New South Wales. Franklin reported to Normanby that there was a rural dean and three Episcopal chaplains who received a small stipend of £50 annually to attend convicts in gaols and hospitals; there was one Presby- terian minister for the same work, but no provision for Catholic con- victs.103 In 1839, Franklin was sufficiently concerned to ask Russell whether any of the clergy appointed to ecclesiastical establishments in Van Diemen’s Land could be required to visit gaols, houses of correction and road gangs. Russell referred this to Charles Blomfield (1786–1857), bishop of London from 1828 to 1856, who observed that the new Church Acts imposed no such duties on them. It would therefore depend entirely on the bishop of the diocese, which, until Nixon’s arrival in 1842, meant Broughton in faraway Sydney.104 In April 1841, Franklin referred again to the ‘great want of religious instruction for the large bodies of convicts arriving in the colony, asking for ‘two pious and practical ministers whose hearts are in the cause’.105 The Chief Police Magistrate wanted a Prot- estant clergyman attached to at least every two gangs who would be 101 Broughton to Bourke, 26 November 1836; Grey to Ullathorne, 10 March 1837, Correspondence on Religion in Australia, BPP 1837–1838 (75), XL.111, pp. 10, 17.

 devoted entirely to the work of reformation, and another for the Roman Catholic convicts.106
 For the Protestant chaplains and religious instructors, the Anglican Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) was the only organiza- tion with resources to respond to the call for a substantial increase in religious provision for convicts following the decision to implement the probation system. Their correspondence provides an important insight into the working clergy in these remote penal outposts. Names and terms of service can be gleaned from the records of the United Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, which includes the correspondence from missionaries sent to all the Australian convict establishments in New South Wales, Van Diemen’s Land, Norfolk Island and Western Austra- lia;107 others can be identified from the Cable Index of Australian Angli- can clergy.108 According to the SPG missionary roll,109 between 1835 and 1859 some seventeen missionaries were stationed in what became the Diocese of Tasmania (founded in 1842),110 most of whom served in some capacity as missionaries, religious instructors, schoolmas- ters or chaplains to convicts. Including these SPG missionaries, the Cable Index identifies twenty-five convict chaplains or religious instruct- ors; others left little record of their ministry. Anglicans, Catholics and Dissenters were engaged to work as religious instructors, catechists and school teachers at the height of the probation scheme (Table 8.5), though only the Anglicans are reviewed here. As Bishop Willson testified, there was no real attempt to provide for the needs of Roman Catholic prisoners under probation.111 In 1845, Willson requested five Catholic priests for Van Diemen’s Land; Stanley approved two, neither specified for convict pastoral duties.112
 Traditionally the Church of England considered the work of SPG missionaries to convicts in Australia an antidote to ‘ungodly colonisation 106 ‘Minutes of an Executive Council Meeting, Hobart, 29 March 1841’, encl. 1, Ibid., p. 389.

 http://anglicanhistory.org in its worst form’, which combined efforts to ‘save the convicts from a state more pitiful than that of the heathen’ and the free settlers from ‘lapsing into heathenism’.113 Convict support included funds to pay for schoolmasters or schoolmistresses chosen by the chaplains, including two, from 1797 to 1826, on Norfolk Island.114 Three kinds of problems were negotiated by SPG missionaries posted to government appoint- ments with responsibility for religious education or chaplaincy to con- victs in the new, reformative transportation system. First, there were clashes of authority, specifically the authority of the government which managed the convict system as opposed to the ecclesiastical authority which Bishop Nixon claimed to exert over all clergy in his diocese. Secondly, there was friction with other clergy, especially those outside the established church. Thirdly, there was friction over clerical denunci- ation of physical and psychological abuse of convicts. The correspond- ence of religious instructors to the SPG provides extensive evidence of all three.
 The SPG had no resources for this, but the extreme insecurity of the convict chaplains concerned Anna Nixon, who thought they would resign one after another and return to England.124 Nevertheless, both men remained in the colony and did well. Originally a Wesleyan lay preacher, Bennett served as religious instructor at Jerusalem Probation Station in 1844 and Impression Bay before his ordination in 1850. East- man, also a former Wesleyan, served on probation stations as religious instructor before his ordination; from 1857 to 1865 he was chaplain of Port Arthur.

 ordination, usually in Tasmania, and a higher-paid chaplaincy, either in the prison system or elsewhere in the colony. The remarkable Henry Elliott (1814–1884), was a Chartist and Deist who converted under the instruction of the Rev. E. Strickland, serving effectively as religious instructor on Norfolk Island from 1847 to 1850.136 Although delayed by Bishop Nixon’s scruples, Elliott was ordained in Sydney in 1856. Like the former Methodist lay preachers, Bennett and Eastman, the probation system provided a number of devout men with a path to ordination and a career as prison chaplains. Others did less well. The Rev. T. H. Forster (1818–1881) travelled out to Van Diemen’s Land with Bishop Nixon, writing a vivid account of his voyage on the convict ship; his correspond- ence suggests a sad decline into madness and he died in a lunatic asylum.137 Other Anglican, Catholic, Methodist and Dissenting religious instructors were, like the prisoners, anxious for escape while resigned to serving out their sentences.
 Probation was widely regarded as a total failure that exacerbated the very moral and administrative problems it was intended to reform. In his testimony to the 1847 HL SC on the Execution of the Criminal Laws, Bishop Nixon stated that the presence of large numbers of prisoners under the probation system had been ‘injurious in a moral, financial, social, and religious sense’.138 The fairest assessment of it – delivered on the spot in 1847 by Charles La Trobe (1801–1875), and by historians chronologically removed such as A. G. L. Shaw – was that it was not given a chance to succeed given the surge in convict numbers in 1843 and 1844 (Table 8.1).139 La Trobe’s Report, written during his several months as administrator of the colony of Van Diemen’s Land following the dismissal and untimely death of Eardley Wilmot, is the fullest and most careful appraisal of the system.140 Unlike the great 136 Strickland, The Australian Pastor. 137 For the voyage, see Thomas Hay Forster, Account of a Voyage in a Convict Ship with Notes of the First Itinerating Missionary in Tasmania (London: SPCK, 1850). 138
 majority of his predecessors, La Trobe lacked military or administrative experience and had initially been educated, like his father, for the Mor- avian ministry. He was a gifted musician, active in the anti-slavery movement and known to both Haydn and Wilberforce.141 In terms of his outlook on penal reform, his views align with the rational Dissent of Backhouse and Walker (Chapter 4), rather than Arthur’s Evangelical authoritarianism (Chapter 3) or Maconochie’s liberalism (Chapter 7).142
 William Joliffe (1800–1876) reported on the higher costs provoked by the decision to adopt a disciplinary system focussed on reform, which included the expenses attached to constructing new prisons, such as Dartmoor and Portsmouth.146 The usual claims were then made: that prisoners were better treated and fed than paupers, resulting in an ‘injustice to the honest and industrious poor’; that Reading Gaol, a model prison, was offering ‘a premium for the commission of crime’; and that, according to Chisholm Anstey, transportation was so easy that ‘it was looked upon as leading to a life of comfort, if not of affluence, in another land’. Anstey claimed that chaplains’ reports encouraged pris- oners to escape the consequences of their actions, and objected to payments for religious instructors where beneficed clergy were available to do the job more economically. Concern was also expressed about the likely expense of religious instruction at the new convict establishment in Western Australia. While the vote for supply was grudgingly approved, there was no support for more generous provision for convict reform and religious literacy. In defence of reformatory methods, Mr Slaney argued that only ‘by improving the condition of the youth of the country, and by giving them a religious education’ could crime be prevented.147 Never- theless, financial support for reformation programmes was clearly waning, along with any expectation that educating criminals would reduce crime. Once the decision had been made to break up convict establishments in Van Diemen’s Land and Norfolk Island, FitzRoy wasted no time in eliminating allowances to clergy from convict funds in New South Wales. Only the intervention of Bishop Broughton ensured a little continuity for clergy once regarded as lying at the heart of a reformative system.148
 After Probation For all its evident deficiencies, the failure of the probation system did not bring the empire much closer to a complete end to transportation for British and Irish prisoners. Clerical observers were understandably reluc- tant to attribute blame for its deficiencies on the weakness of religious instruction. Chaplains of gaols and penitentiaries, as well as Bishop Willson and Bishop Nixon, firmly opposed to transportation in other contexts, testified to the 1847 SC on Criminal Law that if properly 146 Sir William Jolliffe, Hansard, HC Deb, vol. 121, col. 1410, 3 June 1852. 147 Mr Slaney, Hansard, HC Deb, vol. 121 col. 1412, 3 June 1852. 148 FitzRoy to Grey, 20 December 1847, 12 February 1843, BPP 1849 (1022 and 1121) XLIII.61, p. 90.
 That the probation scheme was not fundamentally flawed is strongly suggested by the success of the convict system devised by John Montagu (1797–1853), colonial secretary to Van Diemen’s Land under Arthur, for the Cape Colony, which included provision for religious instruction to mobile gangs.152 Under Montagu’s system, rewards were provided to the gangs which ‘laboured best’ and also individuals who ‘improved most in religious and secular instruction’.153 This was tracked by a monthly report from the superintendent which listed attendance and progress at school and chapel; those who did best earned a monetary reward of six shillings which was placed in the savings bank on their behalf. To provide skilled religious instruction, ordained missionaries were sourced from the Rhenish Missionary Society and the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, which also avoided clashes with the Anglican bishop. Montagu’s scheme involved neither large numbers,154 nor the transport of British or Irish convicts to the Cape Colony and was implemented without the moral panic aroused by gang-based labour for public works under pro- bation in Van Diemen’s Land. Until Britain built new penitentiaries, transportation still beckoned as the most convenient solution.
 Stanley’s probation system was a liberal attempt to reform transporta- tion and to implement the religious ideals of the leaders of the penal reform movement in the colonies. It had the support of leading British statesmen of the day, including Lord John Russell and Sir James Graham, and was implemented by a stream of newly appointed religious instructors. While never adequate for the task they were asked to under- take – nothing less than the reform of Britain and Ireland’s most hardened criminals, armed only with the Rules devised for Pentonville, the Bible and a little theological training – the religious elements of the scheme were not entirely unsuccessful. Many prisoners learnt to read, 161 H. Butler-Stoney, A Year in Tasmania (based on a journey undertaken in 1853), cited by Brand, Penal Peninsula, p. 109.
 For the religious instructors, a fundamental issue was their subordin- ation to the convict comptroller general, which ensured probation was never embraced by the ecclesiastical hierarchy. This was felt more deeply by ordained priests and ministers and colonial chaplains, both Anglican and Catholic, though Methodists and former Methodists with experience of lay preaching seem to have managed rather better. The removal of private assignment more or less ensured that the colonists would aban- don their support for convict transportation, since it brought few eco- nomic benefits to them while burdening them with the presence of former criminals, whom they believed to be responsible for rising crime, and tainted them with moral failures which they vehemently denied. The failure of the religious instructors to reform and uplift prisoners under the probation system was a personal indictment for many conscientious men and their families. It made them much more likely to join the ranks of those who considered the only future for the colony to consist in bringing an end to transportation. Anglican, Catholic, Methodist and other Dissenting clergy were therefore well represented, as we will see in the next chapter, in the anti-transportation movement led by the Rev. John West.
 the Cape’s Anti-Convict Association in 1849 and the Australasian Anti- Transportation League in 1851 marked a new, more intensive and political phase for the anti-transportation movement. Despite traditional distaste for ‘political parsons’,4 religious threads run through the differ- ent colonial campaigns at many levels: in the rhetoric of moral crisis and redemption deployed by all participants, in the participation by clergy in the activities of the different anti-transportation organizations, in the clerical leadership of the innumerable meetings, petitions to government and letters to newspapers which made up the campaigns. In Australia, the Rev. John West (1809–1873), a Congregationalist minister and jour- nalist, helped give the movement much of its loyalist, non-sectarian political character. In the Cape, clergy wrote petitions and alternately inflamed and moderated the more radical elements of the rumbusti- ous ‘convict crisis’ of 1848–1849. Bishops and higher clergy led 1 The Argus (Melbourne), 12 May 1851, p. 2. 2 ‘A Song for the Australasian League, July 1851’, Rev. John West Newspaper Cuttings, 1850–1851, SLNSW 365/W.
 denominational interventions with government and wrote theological tracts attacking convict transportation. Archdeacon Marriot argued that it was immoral and irreconcilable with God’s plan for human society to devise purely penal colonies.5 This undercut schemes for reformative transportation and marked the end of the alliance between established church and state which had sustained Arthur’s regime in Van Diemen’s Land, the last of the fully penal colonies. This chapter will assess the significance of the religious interventions in this phase of the campaign to end convict transportation. It will consider why arguments about the reformative power of transportation, and the influence of religion within the penal system, failed to convince either the colonists or the govern- ment that it should continue.
 Since the eighteenth century, secular and religious critics had opposed the practice of penal transportation for British and Irish criminals. What happened in the 1840s is that views previously restricted to a minority of penal reformers, with divergent theological, political and intellectual roots in Britain and Ireland, became much more widely diffused, vocal and organized as they were taken up by a liberal coalition mostly located in the colonies.6 The restrained exchanges between Archbishop Whately 5 Fitzherbert Adams Marriott, Is a Penal Colony Reconcileable with God’s Constitution of Human Society and the Laws of Christ’s Kingdom?

Roberts, ‘Remembering ‘‘Australia’s Glorious League’’: The Historiography of Anti-Transportation’, Journal of Australian and Lt Governor Arthur, the sectarian spat between Judge Burton and Father Ullathorne, or the outpourings of Captain Maconochie and his critics and supporters, were drowned out by a noisy, trans-colonial hue and cry. Abolitionists opposed the government view, promoted by Earl Grey, secretary of state for war and the colonies from 1846 to 1852, that transportation was a benefit to the colonies. Colonists and colonial administrators disagreed, pointing not only to the moral damage inflicted by convicts on penal colonies, but the miasma diffused to nearby regions with vulnerable native populations. Race was central to imperial argu- ments about convicts given the complex racial and religious dynamic of the Cape Colony and missionary claims of convict depredations on New Zealand and the Pacific.7 In Australia, Archbishop Whately and the Aborigines Protection Society condemned the convict impact on Abori- gines, with awareness heighted by the 1838 Myall Creek massacre.8 The capacity of colonists to make their views heard increased as liberal reforms widened access to parliament, opened up political opportunities for Dissenters and fostered a vigorous, free and commercial press.
 Rather than advance a common humanity, the Bible was used to pro- mote settler rights and mobilize rural communities against convicts and other perceived threats.19 The church of the settler majority was the Dutch Reformed Church or NGK (Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk) and it was not ‘established’, though in 1847 the Colony had been endowed with an Anglican bishop, Robert Gray (1809–1834), one of four colonial bishops consecrated in a single ceremony in Westminster Abbey on St Peter’s Day, 1847.20 The replacement of the colonial chaplaincy with an 14 Stephen H. Roberts, The Squatting Age in Australia, 1835–1847 (Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 1964), p. 320.
 Anglican episcopal hierarchy was not without its complications with most Anglican clergy on low stipends and lacking influence and status.21
 There were vigorous missions with rising numbers of adherents among different tribal and urban communities, some of which mobilized to oppose the convict arrivals.22 Gray aligned himself with the anti-convict cause in the Cape, going so far as to come on board the Neptune in its infamous attempt to land convicts at the Cape, where he had the pleasure of meeting John Mitchel.23 In New South Wales and the Cape, clergy who participated in the anti-transportation movement did so for rather different reasons, but to the same eventual outcome – a total rejection of the continued deployment of convict labour in British colonies.
 Popular protest against convict transportation was ignited by the attempt to reintroduce convict labour to British colonies, including New South Wales. In 1846 Gladstone, who served as secretary of state for war and the colonies in the conservative ministry of Sir Robert Peel (despite not having a seat in either house), requested that the incoming New South Wales governor, Sir Charles FitzRoy (1796–1858), consider the resumption of transportation to New South Wales in a limited form.24 The despatch is a good example of Gladstone’s most convoluted style, but it gave FitzRoy the option of making a wide survey of public opinion, or simply getting the consent of the Legislative Council before proceeding. Although it was by no means an imperial edict, this has not prevented Gladstone being vilified as the politician who wanted to bring back the convicts. The third Earl Grey, who served as secretary of state for the colonies under Russell’s Whig administration,25 earned similar acrimony on the grounds that he was simply ‘biding his time’ before re- opening the convict sewer line between Britain and the southern col- onies. When Gladstone’s despatch was made public, editors denounced 21 Hattersley, The Convict Crisis, p. 33. 22 At the time of the convict crisis, major missionary societies active in the Cape included the Moravians, London Missionary Society (Congregationalist), Church Missionary Society (Anglican), Berlin Missionary Society (Lutheran), Rhenish Missionary Society (Lutheran), Glasgow Missionary Society (Presbyterian) and the Methodist Missionary Society; Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, ‘Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony’, in Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport (eds.), Christianity in South Africa (Cape Town: Maskew Miller Longman, 1997), 31–50.
 cross-colonial, anti-convict agitation that was qualitatively different to the earlier phases of the anti-transportation movement.
 resigned their seats and, though they were replaced (some refused the offer), it was not so easy to breach the blockade of supplies from mer- chants and the edict from banks and insurance offices that they would conduct no business with anyone who opted out of the anti-convict pledge.82 The bitterness of the dispute was extended, and to some extent was coordinated by means of, churches, chapels, missions and the Jewish synagogue. The South Australian Register reported that an elder of the Dutch Reformed Church was compelled to resign when all his fellow elders refused to worship with him:83 ‘[A]ll look upon the conduct of these men as highly sinful . . . There is not any one of the various religious denominations in South Africa which would not regard it in the same light.’84 Smith advised Earl Grey that the resistance to the disembark- ation of the Neptune was much stronger than he had anticipated, that it included objections from ‘every religious persuasion’, including the Anglican bishop of Cape Town and leaders of the Dutch Reformed Church, and advised a strategic retreat.85 After consulting the Prime Minister, Grey agreed to do so.
 Churches led the way in formulating petitions to Governor Smith against the arrival of convicts, as they had done against the introduction of juvenile offenders from Parkhurst in 1842.86 Of the fifty-five petitions Smith submitted with his despatches of 24 May and 14 June 1849, thirty- eight or about 70 per cent were prepared by clergy and adherents of Cape Colony’s many churches, including the Anglican bishop of Cape Town and clergy, the Roman Catholic bishop and clergy of the Western Provinces, along with clergy and people of the Baptist, Congre- gational, Dutch Reformed, Episcopal, Lutheran, Moravian, Presbyter- ian, Wesleyan and Native Independent Congregations of the London Missionary Society. Many refer to the injury likely to be caused to missionary work on the frontier by the arrival of British criminals. A group of thirteen ministers objected that convicts would constitute a ‘direct and palpable aggression on the moral condition, low as it is of the numerous South African tribes’.87 Representatives of the Dutch Reformed Church, the largest in the city, pleaded for the introduction 82 George McCall Theal, History of South Africa since September 1795, 5 vols.

 A sophisticated response to the convict crisis was provided by the South African Auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) 88 ‘Memorial of the Consistory of the Dutch Reformed Church of the City of Cape Town’, 17 April 1849, Ibid.

 in a pamphlet printed in Cape Town following a special meeting on 20 July 1849.97 Auxiliaries of the non-denominational society had been formed in Cape Town, Graham’s Town and Salem where their work included providing Bibles and written materials for Protestant missions and settlers along the frontier.98 Mission propaganda represented this activity as critical to advance a moral occupation in partnership with converts such as ‘The Christian Hottentot’ who exclaimed: ‘We are tame men now ... I thank God, in the name of every Hottentot . . . that I have seen the face of Englishmen.’99 All this was put at risk by the arrival of dissolute whites. Choosing to ornament their title page, not with an extract from scripture but a quotation from Archbishop Whately’s ‘Remarks on Transportation’, the Society appealed to ‘fellow-subjects in other British settlements’ to support their rejection of the white plague and all its moral pollution.100
 Rather late in the day, Anglican clergy chose to intervene in the convict crisis with the intention of calming the more turbulent elements. The leading newspaper in the Eastern Cape was the Grahamstown Journal, which provided loyal support to Governor Smith against radicals, such as John Philip of the LMS, who had the backing of the South African Commercial Advertiser, edited by Philip’s son-in-law, John Fairbairn. The rebuff to Governor Smith by the Anti-Convict Association was seen as discourteous, and a more respectful address was presented to him by a group of 114 moderate protestors including leading clergy. Signatories included the Rev. William Long, colonial chaplain and minister for Graaff-Reinet; the Rev.

 This ‘population of superior men’ was, presumably, men like themselves, religiously observant free emigrants, not Irish or Catholic if possible and loyal subjects of the Crown. Loyalty was in short supply in the Cape, as Archdeacon N. J. Merriman (1809–1882), later Anglican bishop of Grahamstown, observed when reflecting on the feeling among the people on the Queen’s birthday at the height of the anti-convict crisis.103
 Adderley took up the cause of the Cape in Parliament, in gratitude for which he would later be honoured with a handsome library chair. He was also nominated as a representative for the Colony of Victoria as an advocate for the Australasian Anti-Transportation League. As part of a concerted propaganda campaign, the Cape anti-convict movement has been defined by its unity, patriotism and loyalism, reflected in the title of the pioneering study by Alan Hattersley, as well as the gestures of solidarity across class and creed and liberal historiography of the move- ment. Yes, as Holdridge argues, claims to loyalism and unity effaced other forms of dissent outside the carefully curated activities of the Anti- Convict Association.105 In 1908, with the pains of the South African War still raw, the former missionary and historiographer George McCall Theal looked back at the anti-convict protest as a precious moment of colonial solidarity when, having abandoned slave labour, the colony chose poverty rather than advancing economically on the backs of con- vict labour. Theal praised the ‘intelligent patriotism’ of the people and admired the ‘great advance in liberal ideas’ excited by the convict debate.106 But the solidarity of petition and popular meetings papered over deep divides in the settler community between British and Dutch, Calvinist and Evangelical Protestant, high and low church Anglicans, European and native African Methodists, not to mention the complex dynamics of a mixed population of settlers, former slaves and indigenous 102 Grahamstown Journal, 2 March 1850. 103 Nathaniel James Merriman, H.

 Khoikhoi. The latter occupied a space somewhere outside the unified ‘people in South Africa’ that the colonists claimed to have created in the course of anti-convict agitation.107 In the Cape, Bishop Gray may well have been glad of the distraction of the convict protest since his own clergy were divided between an older generation of chaplains and mis- sionaries, including Evangelicals who resented the arrival of a bishop and his party of high church clergy. While supporting the anti-convict cause, none of Gray’s party signed the anti-transportation petition to the governor.108
 Among the early anti-transportationists, the two ecclesiastics, McEn- croe and Lang, were the most radical advocates for a more independent Australia flowing from the repudiation of the convict legacy.119 In this they were capturing the popular mood reflected in colonial memoirs of the 1840s, such as that of ‘emigrant mechanic’ Alexander Harris (1805–1874), son of a Nonconformist minister. Harris opposed the execution of the men found guilty of the 1838 Myall Creek massacre, which he regarded as pandering to British humanitarians who lacked knowledge of frontier conditions.120 Yet he opposed both flogging and the ‘horrid iniquities of the ultra penal settlements’, where men were herded together or sent to the wilderness ‘whither the sound of holy counsel and spiritual caution never reached’.121 He supported efforts to appeal to the innate moral code and sense of fairness of working men, sending religious advisers who would uplift the convicts and constrain the worst impulses of the masters.122 In New South Wales, the anti- transportationists included many free emigrants like Harris who felt caught between the interests of large capital in the colony and distant imperial policymakers and do-gooders in London.123
 West had a rapid rise to public prominence. He had arrived in Hobart in 1838 with his wife and young family to take up an appointment as itinerating missionary for the Congregationalist Colonial Missionary Society. By 1839, divesting himself of his obligations to the Society,130
 against including two vehement petitions from Anglican clergy led by Marriott, and Dissenting clergy, including John West, which specifically condemned the probation system for encouraging unnatural crime; in South Australia, New Zealand, Cape of Good Hope and Mauritius, they were all against, including a strong petition by the Evangelical Alliance in Wellington, New Zealand. The exception was Western Australia, where seven out of eight meetings of colonists, landowners and stockholders were enthusiastic about the arrival of convicts.
 Following the Molesworth SC, there had been widespread affront taken at the slights it projected on the moral standing of the colonists, the claims of sexual depravity on behalf of the convicts and callous mastery by the free settlers. In New South Wales, there was hostility to all those who testified to the Molesworth Committee, including the Catholic Vicar General, Dr Ullathorne, as discussed in Chapter 6.144
 In 1839, Launceston clergy and laity published ‘An Answer to the Calumnies of the English Press being the Testimony of the Lieutenant Governor and of the Resident Ministers of the Various Communions of Van Diemen’s Land upon the Moral and Religious Character of the Free Population of the Colony’.145 There were subscription lists drawn up of those who supported the pro-transportation cause, including a number of respectable clergy. In Northern Van Diemen’s Land, the Baptist government catechist, Henry Dowling and the Rev. J. Simpson, a Wes- leyan preacher, spoke in defence of the ‘moral and religious condition of the inhabitants’ in a public meeting held in Launceston in April 1839.146
 West would later suggest that there had been no opposition to the abandonment of convictism: ‘The parents – the women of Van Diemen’s Land – the clergy, singly – all sects together and in their separate churches, kept up by petitions a constant fire.’150 This reflects the wording of the petition of April 1850, written in response to the arrival of the Neptune which West included as an appendix to his history; the plea came from ‘the parents of 20,000 children’, the clergy and the magistrates; that is, those charged with the education, guardianship and moral guidance of the colony.151 West continued to show a genius for articulating a form of words which steered the movement towards the high moral ground, securing consensus and collaboration and avoiding potentially damaging divisions.
 West circumvented the reality of division in the movement by empha- sizing unity above all else – and to a large extent the strategy was politically astute and effective. The Congregationalists had pioneered non-sectarian Christian activism in the missionary movement and the consensus that united Exeter Hall at home was galvanized to ensure a solid coalition against the London advocates of continued transportation. As in Cape Colony, both Anglican and Catholic bishops of Van Die- men’s Land opposed transportation, primarily on humanitarian grounds; the one remaining voice of opposition was Bishop Broughton in New South Wales, who had earlier defended Lt Governor Arthur’s penal system against Archbishop Whately. Finally, even Broughton changed his mind providing a letter which was included in an appendix to the instructions to the London delegation of the Australasian League.152
 150 West, History of Tasmania, vol. 1, p. 292. 151 Ibid. 152 Australasian League Executive Board, Letter of Instructions to the London Delegates of the Several Colonies of Australia (Sydney: Daniel, 1851), appendix. 153 For example, when demanding precedence over other Catholic bishops and arch- bishops: Bishop Broughton to Sir Charles Fitzroy, 22 May 1850, Letter from Bishop of Sydney in Relation to Rank, BPP 1851 (105) XXXV.65.
 This was a grudging admission that Broughton found the abandonment of transportation to be inevitable, not because it was the right policy but simply because it was the view of nearly everyone else. The letter appeared in the colonial press, but the Argus provided the editorial rider: ‘We are no admirers of political parsons, but the transportation ques- tion is a social one, and not a political.’155 It was the end of an era in many ways. The following year Broughton sailed for England and never returned. He died on 20 February 1853 in the home of Lady Gipps, widow of his old schoolfriend, the former governor of New South Wales, and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral.156
 manners of his Congregation.’159 And when Bishop Broughton inter- vened in the education debate, he was called ‘A political parson of the most dangerous description’ and ‘the worst of all political priests’.160 So what was it that made this campaign different, and why did clergy feel free to participate?
 Once the movement was underway, there was a concerted push to create petitions that would resonate with those in government. As Lt Governor of the colony with the most significant penal population, Denison in Van Diemen’s Land bore the brunt of the defence of Earl Grey’s transportation dreams. His considered view, expressed in a confi- dential dispatch of 2 May 1850, was that both the evils allegedly caused by transportation and also the benefits to be created by its abolition were greatly exaggerated. Resignedly, he forwarded a petition on 18 December 1850 from the bishop and clergy of the Church of England, who might in other times have been numbered among the defenders of government policy.161 By the standards of the secular anti-transportation petitions this was a modest affair, with just thirty-seven signatures, but these included the bishop, archdeacons and clergymen of the ‘United Church of England and Ireland in Tasmania’. This may have been a particular trial to Denison because his wife was friendly with both Bishop Nixon and Archdeacon Marriott; their children played together and when Mar- riott married, Denison’s wife regaled the family with the details.162
 Referring to themselves as ‘ministers of peace’, the clerical petition invoked the ‘appalling evils resulting from transportation’, regretted plans to make Van Diemen’s Land a ‘permanent penal colony’ and condemned the continued arrival of convicts on the grounds that this would perpetuate divisions in society, ‘seriously impeding the efforts of your Majesty’s petitioners to promote the extension and continuance of Christian peace and love, according to their appointed duty’.163 These views were in accord with Marriott’s printed letter addressed to Lt Governor Denison in 1847, arguing that exclusive penal colonies were morally unjustifiable.164 His objections were both to a penal colony ‘left to grow into a colony of emancipists alone’, and a free colony ‘made to 159 Thomas Parmeter, M. D.‘Lines to a clergyman’, Sydney Gazette (27 October 1835), p. 4.
 bear the burthen of the crimes of its Father-land’.165 Denison’s response to the latter is not recorded, but his official correspondence suggests he found the resistance of the established clergy to the policy of the government to be as welcome as that of the members of his own Legislative Council. In Launceston, a clerical gathering was led by the Anglican bishop of Melbourne, Charles Perry (1807–1891), encouraging anti-transportation petitions on the grounds that as long as Tasmania remained a convict settlement, ‘Victoria must suffer all the evils of convictism, without any of the advantages supposed to flow from that system.’166 This was a notable concord between rival church parties in the Australian colonies since Marriott and Nixon were both high church- men and Perry an Evangelical who differed from Nixon on almost all points. Yet here they were united in opposition to the convict menace.
 As the delegate for Van Diemen’s Land to the Australasian League and the only cleric, John West was able to generate respectable support for the anti-transportation movement and sympathy for clergy who chose to participate. At the Melbourne launch of the Australasian League in 1851, one participant affirmed the role played by clergy in the anti-slavery movement, and called on ‘members of that profession in Australia’ to enter ‘heart and soul’ into the anti-transportation cause.173
 Many proceeded to do so. In South Australia, founded as a free colony, the meeting to establish a branch of the League attracted all the leading clergy and included two delegates from the Australasian Conference, including West, who addressed the meeting. Reflecting the inclusive policy pursued by churches in the Cape, all five motions were either moved or seconded by the clergy representing all the leading 169 Thomas D. Chapman, Memorial to Earl Grey, 29 May 1851, Ibid., p. 8. When Tasmania was plunged into economic depression, Denison sounded rather pleased to be able to report to his mother that his ‘poor old colony’ it was mired in bankruptcies and disaster. ‘My poor old colony, Van Diemen’s Land, is in a very miserable condition. I kept warning the people of what would be the result of the cessation of transportation and the blow has now come upon them.’ Denison to Mrs Denison, 5 February 1857, Denison, Varieties, vol. 2, p. 379.
 denominations. The Anglican bishop of Adelaide moved ‘That the ces- sation of transportation to the Australian Colonies is essential to their honour, happiness, and prosperity’; the Rev. Mr Stow followed, with support from the Rev. Mr Symons, ‘That this meeting rejoices in the union of Victoria, Van Diemen’s Land and New SouthWales, in on great confederation, to secure by moral means the deliverance of these fair regions from the curse of convictism’. Others were proposed by the Rev. Daniel James Draper (1810–1866), Wesleyan Methodist minister of Pirie Street Church, seconded by Father George Backhaus (1811–1882), minister to Adelaide’s German Catholic community and the Rev. John Gardner (1809–1899) of the Free Presbyterian Church.174 This privil- eging of clerical voices can hardly be accidental and was calculated to demonstrate West’s most powerful weapon – that the ‘Australias’ were united in their opposition, that the campaign to defeat transportation was a moral and ethical one which garnered support across the denomin- ational spectrum and that it was the first step in greater unity across the colonies. Other clergy took the lead in motions recorded in support of the anti-transportation cause. At Port Macquarie in northern New South Wales, founded as a penal settlement in the 1820s, the Rev. William McKee expressed the alarm of his fellow colonists at suggestions that the northern districts might be separated into a district ‘forming a place for British criminals’. He objected to any place which would, in the words of the motion, ‘disgrace us in the eyes of our fellow colonists’ and ‘infallibly bring guilt and ruin upon ourselves and the colony generally’.175
 Cowper was a pastoralist and politician who became aligned with the liberal faction opposing transportation on the New South Wales Legisla- tive Council. As the son of the colonial chaplain, he was closely associ- ated with the interests of the Church of England.176 The New South Wales movement was pragmatic, informed and liberal – but, like the Van Diemen’s Land movement, it made strategic use of religious language to add moral weight to its testimonials. The fullest and most eloquent expression of the principles of the Australasian League were incorporated into the ‘Letter of Instructions to the London delegates’, drawn up following the Sydney Conference of the League, held in April and May 1851. The details of this were said to have been finalized by John West, and indeed it bears the mark of his easy, moralizing style.177 The ‘Instructions’ stressed that all religious authorities deplored the presence of crime and criminals in their midst and supported the cause: The people of Great Britain need not be told that Ministers of every religious persuasion, and parents of every rank, feel that no earthly consideration can, or ought to, reconcile them, to expose their families, or their flocks, to the contagion of crime.178
 In line with other political campaigns, the resolution came not with a triumph of one side or another but with regime change. The collapse of Lord John Russell’s Liberal government saw Grey’s departure as secretary of state for war and the colonies, an office he had held from July 1846 to 21 February 1852. His successors were much less averse to acknowledging the role played by the colonial opposition to transportation in bringing about an end to the system. An Order in Council revoking the status of Van Diemen’s Land as a penal colony was passed on 29 December 1853, to universal rejoicing in the ‘Empire’s gaol’. In the House of Lords, Grey attempted to condemn the measure, but was outvoted.186 As to the moral and religious argument, much of which had focussed on the reformation of convicts, the outcome of this remained uncertain.
 Despite tacit and overt hostility to ‘political parsons’, the clergy were active participants in the anti-transportation movement and they can be found, on both sides of the argument, in all colonies threatened by Earl Grey’s decision to open up the empire to receiving British convicts. Clergy participated in three major ways, all of them effective in lending dignity to the proceedings: convening and chairing meetings, signing petitions and writing, on behalf of their flocks, to government and eccle- siastical officialdom. The particular strategies taken by different clergy tended to reflect the theological and ecclesiological traditions of their respective churches. The anti-transportation campaign began in Van Diemen’s Land, which was most affected by the attempt to renew the transportation of convicts and which was the largest and most important of the empire’s penal colonies. There it was led by the Rev. John West, 184 Shaw, Convicts and the Colonies, p. 347. 185 Grey, The Colonial Policy of Lord John Russell. 186 Shaw, Convicts and the Colonies, p. 351. For colonial celebrations, see Holdridge, ‘Pageantry’.
 who infused the movement with its non-denominational, liberal and moral character. Although they made up the smallest of the Protestant sects in the colonies, it was not surprising to find Congregationalists in pole position, as they had been on other imperial campaigns, from anti- slavery to broader political movements to widen the franchise, liberalize the press and remove religious impediments to participation in civil affairs. West also led the campaign to unite the separate colonies in a movement to protect their common interests.
 In the Cape Colony and in New Zealand, clergy who participated in petition making were anxious to point to the implications for the mis- sionary movement of the arrival of those they perceived as degraded whites, who would fail to set an appropriate Christian standard of behav- iour for emerging tribes. In Van Diemen’s Land, clerical petitions were more likely to raise moral issues, such as the opposition to the perceived association between the probation gang system and unnatural crime. The most significant clerical activity was that in the Cape Colony, where the churches acted to coordinate petition writing, acting as representatives for the whole community and its moral stance against the arrival of convicts, including juveniles from Parkhurst and the Irish Exiles from Bermuda who precipitated the convict crisis of 1849.
 The Anglican clergy, who included an important group of newly consecrated bishops to the colonies of New South Wales, Van Diemen’s Land and the Cape Colony, lent prestige and social standing to the movement Initially, the only bishop to remain attached to the pro- transportation cause was the Anglican bishop of Sydney, Richard Grant Broughton. When the anti-transportationists finally persuaded him to add a letter of support to the great federal petition, sent to London in 1851, it was reasonable to think that all sectors had been conquered. In Van Diemen’s Land, Bishop Nixon and Archdeacon Marriott secured a united front for the Anglican clergy, all the more surprising because of the divisions raging between high and low churchman in this most fractious of Australian colonial seas. They were soon joined by the Evangelical Anglican bishop of Melbourne, Charles Perry, securing a united episcopal front and a resounding rupture between the formerly established church and the colonial government.
 Among the Catholic clergy, the most radical voice was provided by Archdeacon McEncroe, whose American experience had inclined him towards democracy and whose pastoral duties within the convict system, including the vicissitudes of Norfolk Island, had convinced him that there was no justification for maintaining a system so demoralizing, inconsistent and inhumane. He was the successor to earlier Catholic clergy, including Archdeacon Ullathorne and Bishop Willson, who had provided effective witness to humanitarian abuses within the convict system. Catholics had their own counter-narrative to the vice and immorality of convictism, one which celebrated their survival despite the neglect and abuse of the British authorities. They were to embrace the opportunities for federalism and religious autonomy in the rising colonies. Collectively, the clergy were most significant at this stage of the anti-transportation movement as symbols of their wider commu- nities. It was John West’s genius to recognize this and to have the focus and energy to maintain a coalition of the willing to end the transport of convicts to the eastern colonies of Australia. Recognizing their central role, the churches participated joyfully in the celebrations for the ending of transportation to Van Diemen’s Land and New South Wales, as they had done when the Neptune was seen off at the Cape. Nevertheless, convict transportation was not yet at an end as the focus of the cam- paign – and the convicts – turned to the hulks.
 Although Alder does not mention them, the convict establishment sup- ported a Roman Catholic clergyman (£100), and a Presbyterian minister Table 10.2 Abstract of 1852 vote for prisons and transportation in Great Britain and Ireland and the colonies Annual £ Annual £ per prisoner General superintendence at home Prisons in Great Britain for 7,824 convicts Prisons in Ireland for 4,796 convicts 16,200 220,900 28.2 54,300 11.3

 Throughout the 1830s, while the Bermuda hulks remained in Cap- per’s charge, the chaplains’ reports were brief, token and complaisant. This reflects the view of the Colonial Office that regarded the system as predominately one of labour management. The hulks were therefore the last places where the reformatory gales that had blown through the old gaols and penal colonies were allowed to flow. Several factors changed the assumption that the hulks were beyond reform: firstly, in Bermuda, the recurrence of epidemics of such severity that the government felt bound to act. Secondly, the challenge to the viability of the service created by the Irish Famine and the transportation of paupers, rather than able-bodied labourers which compromised the unspoken policy of ‘labour and economy first’. And thirdly, the arrival of some distinguished administrators and chaplains, determined to either drive through change or abolish the hulks altogether. It was a new instalment in the anti- transportation battle.
 The chaplains were initially always members of the Church of England reinforced with occasional visits from distant bishops. Despite its loca- tion in the North Atlantic the bishop with responsibility for Bermuda from 1825 to 1839 was based in Nova Scotia, over 1,300 kilometres away. In 1835, John Inglis (1777–1850), third bishop of Nova Scotia,39
 visited Bermuda and offered to preach a sermon in each of the hulks. Four years later, in July 1839, the Rev. William Tate, chaplain to the Portsmouth dockyard, reported: ‘The general attention of these mis- guided men at Divine Service is most decent and commendable; and their usual appearance, both on board and when out of work, is that of an orderly body of men.’40 In 1839, the Anglican diocese was divided when Aubrey George Spencer was made bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda. With rising expectations of religious emancipation, Catholic and Dissenting clergy also made their appearance. The first Catholic chaplain’s report from Bermuda was made by the Rev. J. G. Murray, who had been in the post for just nine months but reported, in a single sentence: ‘every detail connected with this Establishment has been con- ducted in a manner characterized by the utmost quiet, regularity, and contentment’.41 From Ireland Island, Bermuda, the veteran Anglican chaplain Robert Mantach remained positive, delighted to have received supplies of books that enabled him to distribute the scriptures to the prisoners.42
 This was a belated response to a vigorous request from Edward Feild (1801–1876), the bishop of Newfoundland, during his visitation to Ber- muda in April 1845, who had asked Governor Reid for facilities to allow the convict chaplain to assist with the education of the black population as well as the construction of a residence on Ireland Island and a new chapel.61 Besides delivering a charge to the clergy, Feild had preached in each of the convict hulks and tried to assert exclusive privileges for the Church of England over the convict establishment, warning Reid about the dangers of ‘latitudinarian principles’, which presumably applied to other Protestants, as well as the ‘Romish Bishop’ in Nova Scotia, who was 55 ‘Opening of the Colonial Parliament’, Royal Gazette Extra, TNA CO 37/111: 388.
 Recognizing the reality of the need for toleration, Elliot wanted to promote convict schools with as much non-sectarian thoroughness as he could and asked for books of instruction from the British and Foreign School Society. He proposed that there should be a Board of Visitors and initially suggested that it consist of the Anglican bishop or his deputy, the senior minister of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Scotland or any other persuasions. On reflection, he decided against this, noting: ‘Visitors should not do more upon religious subjects than to ascertain that the prisoners had the consolation and advice of the Ministers of the persuasion to which they belonged.’64 In one year, therefore, Elliot had launched a trial of Maconochie’s mark system, provided for a more diverse religious ministry and more effective schooling for the convicts. What could go wrong?
 Elliot saw the presence of these men as a humanitarian problem for which he hoped to find an honourable solution. The Irish also aroused security concerns; a number were likely to be sympathetic to violent political causes, in close proximity to the politicized Irish in the nearby United States. Elliot immediately tried to remove all the juveniles, describing them as ‘friendless men in humble stations of life’ who might 62 Feild to Reid, 4 April 1845, attaching: ‘The Bishop’s Patent, Charge Delivered to the Clergy of Bermuda by Edward Feild Bishop of Newfoundland at His First Visitation on the Feast of St Matthias, 1845’, TNA CO 37/111/14: 146.
 Irish prisoners were also problematic because of anxieties about their religion and the perceived risk (from the Protestant point of view) of proselytization by the Catholic priests permitted to minister to prisoners on the hulks. Elliot was concerned when a prisoner wished to convert to Roman Catholicism, ruling that a private ceremony was acceptable but not a public baptism in the Roman Catholic church. Prisoners were to be provided with the ‘utmost practical liberty of conscience’, but this should not upset the peace of the prison.68 In 1851, Elliott ruled against the legitimacy of a marriage ceremony performed by the Catholic chaplain, the Rev. Thomas Lyons (d.1853),69 who had issued bans of marriage on board the Medway between the colonists James Dunbar Bell, a Roman Catholic, and Eleanor June Roberts, a Wesleyan Methodist.70 Lyons was interviewed by Governor Elliot who dismissed him, despite his otherwise excellent conduct, because of what he saw as a serious impropriety. Grey intervened to ensure that Lyons was able to resume his mission which was a triumph for common sense. Clearly uncomfortable dealing with Irish Catholic priests in a penal context, Elliot complained to Earl Grey in 1851 that since 1848 there had been four Roman Catholic priests chosen at the convenience of the Roman Catholic bishop of Halifax. He asked Grey to approach ‘some moderate and liberal minded Roman Catholic laymen of influence in England’ in order to secure a ‘temperate and judicious Roman Catholic Minister of English birth’ for service in Bermuda.71 Meanwhile the hulks continued to float in a liminal state as far as religious establishment was concerned.
 Ordained in 1853, he served as assistant curate in Crayke, Yorkshire, then All Souls, Langham Place, London (then, as now, an important seat of Evangelical Anglicanism in London), before heading to Bermuda.

 convictism. This disillusionment was a factor in ensuring clergy sup- ported moves to end the practice of transportation to even this distant outpost of empire.
 The Anglican hierarchy was initially cautious when they heard the news that convicts might be sent to Western Australia. A petition to the governor for increased state support for Anglican religious services in the Swan River Colony in 1841 had been rebuffed by a counter petition declaring ‘compulsory measures are contrary to the spirit of Christian- ity’.19 After the debacle of the probation system in Van Diemen’s Land, they were aware that to be successful there would need to be sufficient chaplains and trained schoolmasters if the prisons were to be places of reform. From Adelaide, Bishop Augustus Short (1802–1883) wrote to the SPG secretary, Ernest Hawkins (1802–1868), praying that if Swan 16 Ibid., 347, 444. 17 Ibid., 408. 18 Edmund F. Du Cane, The Punishment and Prevention of Crime (London: Macmillan, 1885), p. 160; McConville, English Prison Administration, p. 409. 19 Report of the Statistics of Western Australia in 1840 (Perth: F. Lochee, 1841), appendix, p. ii.
 River was to be ‘inundated with Convicts like Van Diemen’s Land’, then at least the SPG needed to attempt to ‘secure proper religious instruction and superintendence’.20 This was wise since Western Australia was seriously depressed, free emigration was at a standstill and the few clergy already in the colony were stretched to breaking point catering to colon- ists and the missions to the Aborigines.
 sponsored. For this he did not blame the convicts, convinced that the penal establishment was perfectly designed for their reformation, but rather the arrival of mechanics from other colonies.30 The Colonial Office was inclined to agree and, anxious to avoid the outbreak of scandal and claims of demoralization, they were for once open to the need to provide additional clergy, to both bond and free, at the delicate stage when convicts were being introduced into the colony.31 Stipends were supplied for three Anglican chaplains, in addition to that already pro- vided for Wollaston, with the Catholics receiving, belatedly, rather less.

 convict establishment from 1853 to 1855 and his diary and biennial reports show that he took his duties seriously and was committed to the moral reformation of the prisoners. He also secured an organ for the prison chapel.35
 Fremantle’s prison chapel served the Anglican establishment; it was not until 1861 that a Catholic chapel was opened in the Northern Associ- ation ward of the prison.
 With the Catholics descending into ecclesiastical civil war, the field was open to the majority Anglicans at the time that transportation of convicts to Western Australia began in 1850. At first this meant the tiny number of colonial chaplains, the Rev. John Burdett Wittenoom (1788–1855) and the Rev. John Wollaston. As the colony’s prospects improved following the influx of labour, it received that mark of estab- lishment esteem, an Anglican bishop. With funding from the Colonial Bishoprics Fund, Matthew Hale was consecrated bishop of Perth at Lambeth Palace Chapel on 25 July 1857. No stranger to colonial service, Hale had served on the committee of the SPG recommending clergy for the Van Diemen’s Land probation system and at one stage sought a post as missionary to the West Indies. In 1850, Hale fulfilled his ambition of a missionary posting when he accompanied Bishop Short to Adelaide where he founded the Poonindie Natives’ Training Institution, one of the most successful and innovative of all colonial attempts to missionize the Aborigines.37 Hale’s diary, which proceeds in fits and starts (it has no 35 Alex Grose, ‘Pious Labours: Reformation and Reverend Brown’s Chaplaincy’, Fremantle Studies, 8 (2014), 62–77.
 complete the reformation of prisoners following their release. Isolated and with easy access to drink, the men committed breaches of their ticket-of-leave conditions and were trapped in a cycle of reoffending. He asked for a ‘supply of devoted men’ to come to the colony and support the work.45 With sufficient ministers, he was full of hope for a new form of penal colony: ‘[A]s English prisons, when ruled in conform- ity with benevolent and Christian principles, may become reformatories, so may a colony, ruled in the same way, become a reformatory also.’46
 Hale pleaded for high levels of religious intervention both in prison and once men were released to work in the community. This required government support for the payment of salaries to clergy and school- teachers, as well as the construction of churches and chapels. The chal- lenge was that the view of some parliamentarians, stridently backed by figures such as Charles Dickens and advocates for harsher sentencing, was that chaplains were ineffective as evaluators of the potential of prisoners to reoffend. In the 1856 SC on Transportation, several wit- nesses were quizzed in relation to the capacity of the chaplain to perceive when prisoners were deceiving them. There was a particular concern about boys leaving Parkhurst and arriving in British colonies. Although the chaplain attempted to follow up on the boys, he could provide them neither with jobs or a new way of life, particularly in the absence of a home, or intact family, to receive them.47 Captain Irwine S. Whitty, former governor of Parkhurst Prison, testified about the system for discharging young men. Asked ‘How far, in your experience, is the judgement of the chaplain in these matters to be attended to?’, he replied strongly in the affirmative. When asked ‘You must be aware that there is a very strong feeling in the public which is encouraged by works of fiction and other causes, that a certain amount of hypocrisy and judicious temperance of conduct in a prison may enable a criminal to gain, not only the favour of the authorities, but a remission of sentence?’ To this he responded that the chaplains and governors observed the men’s conduct and knew them as well as was possible.48
 In their defence, prison chaplains were far from the naïve dupes that some members of the Select Committee appear to have assumed. The Rev. Joseph Kidd Walpole (1806–1862), chaplain of the Stirling Castle, the invalid hulk at Gosport, was one of those interviewed in 1856. Walpole had served as a missionary with the SPG in Madras before heading to New South Wales where, from 1845 to 1848, he was chaplain of the penal establishment and Benevolent Asylum in Sydney.
 http://www.digitalpanopticon.org/Recidivism While clergy at home remained positive about the need for chaplains in prison and for clergy to follow up as ex-convicts moved into the commu- nity, experience dulled the appetite for this in Western Australia. In 1853, Wollaston confided to his journal that ‘respectable people of the Upper Class are moving away – where they can – who once thought to make this colony the permanent residence of their children. They now dread the prospect of leaving them in a penal colony’.53 Chaplains nevertheless continued to do their duty, ministering in remote and challenging locations as new probation stations and itinerating missions were opened up. Among those who corresponded with the SPG, the Rev. George Pownall (later the first dean of Perth) advised that he conducted an evening ‘recreation’ for the ticket-of-leave men as an alternative to the pub. This involved a formula of tea, coffee, newspapers, chess and dominoes, but the men themselves had put together a music class, which was self-supporting.54 The Rev. Henry Thornhill reported on a Bible class attended by ten young men, three of them on ticket of leave.55 The Rev. James Stuart Price at Pinjarrah was active catechizing in people’s homes, reporting that there were about 200 ticket-of-leave men employed as servants, some of whom attended the services he provided at Pinjarrah, Serpentine and Mandurrah.56 All reflected on the challenges of a bush ministry complicated by the presence of recently released prisoners or those working for the government on public works, often in remote locations.
 What worked best, Adderley concluded, were establishments at home: cheaper, more effective and independent of the entanglements that were poisoning the path to self-government of the settler colonies and the false claims and falser hopes of reformation of penal reformers.
 chaplain. The cottage barracks for the pensioner’s guard to the convict establishment were handsomely designed and sited slightly further away from the main prison. With some care, the convict depot was integrated into the original plan of the town of Fremantle with King’s Square, which included Saint John’s Church of England (1843), and Queen’s Square to the north.69 The primacy given to religion and rehabilitation is reflected not just in the architecture but also in the high status, salary and accom- modation of the religious officers. In short, the system put in place in Western Australia was one of the most reformative ever attempted in the empire. On the whole it was successful in its aim of supporting the growth of the colony and reforming the prisoners who laboured towards this end.
 Abandoning transportation meant a resolute end to reformative experiments designed to assure colonists that prisoners could be made into better people, less likely to reoffend by sending them to the other side of the world. Demonstrating more effectively than anything else the essentially political character of British penal policy, Carnarvon’s knee- jerk reaction to the garrotting panic was to sponsor the passage of the draconian Security from Violence Bill (1863), which allowed the inflic- tion of 150 lashes in instalments of fifty – something long outlawed in the penal colonies. Those under sixteen would receive seventy-five strokes, inflicted in three lots of twenty-five.101 For critics, it seemed like a return to the severity that had been overthrown by the dismantling of the Bloody Code a century earlier.102 The passion and religious commitment of reformers such as Matthew Davenport Hill and Alexander Maconochie, and the consistent reports of chaplains and schoolteachers were ignored. The British opted instead for an increasingly severe system of penal servitude: hard fare, hard work and isolation. While transportation con- tinued for non-Europeans in the British Empire, for British and Irish prisoners the empire of hell was no more.
 This is not to question the very real suffering and degradation of the 185,000 British and Irish convicts transported to penal establishments between 1788 and 1875 or their impact on indigenous people and the colonial landscape. The work of convict historians continues to disclose how convicts supplied the imperial demand for labour to secure and extend the frontier of Britain’s remote settler colonies and naval bases. As humanitarian opponents of transportation stressed, convicts contrib- uted to the destruction of indigenous society in penal colonies, even though they did not choose to initiate these fatal contacts. Saxe Bannister (1790–1877), the former attorney general of New South Wales, denounced convict colonization as a system of extermination of the original inhabitants and demoralization of nearby regions: ‘from island to island outwards, our runaway conicts and unchecked sailors are still covering the whole ocean with our worst vices’.3 The agency and identity of convicts is reflected not just in the impressive infrastructure they created, largely for the benefit of settler colonists who came in their wake, but also in the way they represented their servitude, through memoirs, newspapers, letters and literature, some of it facilitated by the teaching and preaching of clergy and religious instructors. From the 1830s, the contested ideal of reformative transportation was mediated through chaplains, religious instructors, scripture teachers and committed lay- people at the highest levels of government at home and in the colonies. As discussed in Chapter 2, the convict colonies were conceived in the age of atonement, when a dark vision of human nature dominated British cultural politics. This book suggests that religious interventions and collusions in convict transportation were integral to the age of reform and not an aberration from it.
 colonies of Australia, the lure or prospect of reform continued to attract supporters for transportation.
 transportation to Australia, and was not matched elsewhere, for example in the case of French convicts, many of them recidivists, transported to French Guyana and New Caledonia.7 Earl Grey reflected this view when he responded in the House of Lords to news of the very large petitions which had been assembled by the Australasian League: ‘He was firmly persuaded that the system now in operation was that which led to the least evils, because they knew that in the Colonies the great majority of those who were sent out as convicts, though they might not be improved in heart, were, at all events, improved in conduct.’8 Grey’s views echo those of the doyen of the history of convict transportation, A. G. L. Shaw, who agreed that overall the system was not only effective in reducing recidivism but also considerably less punitive in its effect than the system of penal servitude which replaced it.9 Christian penal reformers looked to achieve something more than the ‘least of all evils’; they wanted a penal system whose implicit and explicit values aligned with doctrinal norms, including the internal, spiritual reformation of the criminal.
 Initially, as discussed in Chapter 2, it was the Evangelicals who framed the discussion about the standing of transportation. From the eighteenth century, Christian and secular utilitarians were opposed to transporta- tion and favoured the enlightened solution of the penitentiary, but con- struction was inhibited by cost as much as the usefulness of convict labour to settler colonialism. Evangelicals within the established church then moved to support the next best solution, which was to seek to create penal colonies which would entrench Evangelical values in the empire. In New South Wales, they were highly successful in this endeavour with every colonial chaplain being endorsed by the Evangelical party and many of their societies and principles being advanced by their leading representative, the Rev. Samuel Marsden. Even the parliamentary attacks of William Wilberforce were moderated by the belief that the system would receive the condemnation it deserved at the hands of Commissioner Bigge. In fact this did not happen. Bigge was ordered to make transportation an ‘object of real Terror’,19 not to abolish it; his religious reforms all concerned the settler community, not those who came in chains. The most important Evangelical attempt to make trans- portation the equal to the reformative machine that was the penitentiary was that of Colonel Arthur in Van Diemen’s Land. Chapter 4 showed how Arthur’s effective and authoritarian rule was underpinned by his Evangelical faith. Accused of creating ‘hell on earth’, he was supported to the last by his Evangelical friends. When the first great debate about convict transportation was launched by Archbishop Whately, it was Arthur, in collaboration with Bishop Broughton, who provided an effect- ive justification for the continuance of the system he had created – not ‘hell on earth’ so much as a penal purgatory.
 The first salvo in the campaign to abolish transportation was fired by Archbishop Whately who explained to Earl Grey that the transportation question was not ‘purely political’, but was ‘closely connected with morality’, to the extent that it justified an archbishop taking an interest in it.20 From this point it can be argued, with Whately, that the campaign to end convict transportation became a religious as much as a political issue. Chapter 6 examined the very different intellectual and theological roots of Whately’s thoughts on penal reform, how they had their origins in the Christian utilitarianism of predecessors such as Paley and Chal- mers. The real significance of Whately is that he was influential with the rising Whigs who would soon triumph in the polls, bringing in an age of unprecedented political, legal and social reform. Whately objected to transportation because he believed it was ineffective in reducing crime and impeded effective remedies for social maladies, including education for the poor and free emigration. Whately’s influence was wielded out of all proportion to the time he devoted to this subject because it was magnified by the Molesworth SC on Transportation. Whately provided radical Whigs, who were hostile to convict transportation and keen to promote free emigration and systematic (rather than convict) coloniza- tion, with archiepiscopal authority. Attacked by Colonel Arthur and Bishop Broughton, who opposed his Liberal Anglican churchmanship as much as his utilitarian arguments, Whately retaliated with an effective pamphlet campaign that captured the mood of policymakers which was swinging against claims for both the utility and morality of transportation.
 supporting the bombastic claims of the Molesworth Committee. Chap- ter 7 reflected on the bitter exchange between Judge Burton, for the Protestant establishment, and Father Ullathorne, for post-emancipation Catholics. Burton saw convict society in New South Wales as the prob- lem, in which convicts, emancipists and settlers alike were racing towards crime. Like metropolitan humanitarians, Burton considered convicts to be the deplorable source of violence against Aborigines, such as those engaged in wholesale slaughter in the Myall Creek massacre of 1838. While Burton demanded more Anglican religious instructors to remedy the problem, Ullathorne was more successful in securing Catholic chap- lains. In this he had the support of the Liberal regime in the colony of New South Wales as much as the government in Westminster. The ‘horrors of transportation’ were ameliorated by the liberal balm of equit- able distribution of government funding to the major denominations and dismantling the vestiges of church establishment in New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land.
 TheMolesworth SC recommended the abolition of private assignment and suspending transportation of convicts to New South Wales. But Molesworth’s barbs had no impact on Arthur, who progressed to ever higher colonial duties and unimpeached Evangelical reputation. Attempts to create liberal reforms of transportation continued, of which the most exciting was the experiment conducted by Captain Maconochie on Norfolk Island. Chapter 8 considered the religious roots of Macono- chie’s system, its borrowings from Richard Whately (and Wiliam Paley) and school reformers, who suggested the moral regime of labour-based (rather than time-based) sentencing, and the use of disciplinary regimes based on a symbolic economy. If Whately was a Liberal Anglican, then Maconochie can be viewed as a Liberal Presbyterian, whose system was supported by those who admired his tolerance, positivity and belief in the reforming power of labour. While Maconochie’s regime was relatively short-lived, the most significant investment in religiously-based reform was the probation system, considered in Chapter 9. The many flaws in the implementation of that scheme meant that it was denounced within and without the penal colonies by clergy and lay colonists alike. The ripple-on effect of the failure of probation was significant, bringing to an end the religious consensus that had supported transportation within the established church. With rising hysteria about unnatural crime, the sacking of the Lt Governor of Van Diemen’s Land and the outraged refusal of its Anglican bishop to accept the credentials of convict religious instructors, the system was doomed.
 The anti-convict campaign sparked by attempts to revive convict trans- portation to New South Wales and extend it to other colonies, including the Cape Colony, was discussed in Chapter 10. Church and missionary leaders argued that corrupt whites would damage missionary goals already complicated by ongoing frontier warfare in the Cape and unregu- lated emigration in the Pacific. Clergy participated actively in this cam- paign and the Rev. John West was the acknowledged moral leader of the movement. Religious leaders supported West’s Australasian League because they were persuaded that penal colonies were incompatible with God’s plan, as argued by Archdeacon Marriott in Van Diemen’s Land. But they also chose pragmatically to ally themselves with the rising democratic elements in the colonies, who were dominated by recent, free emigrants and who opposed the interest of the large-scale employers of labour. The central role played by the churches was recognized in the ‘Jubilee’ marking the cessation of transportation to Van Diemen’s Land in 1853, during which public thanksgiving services were held in Hobart at St David’s Anglican Cathedral, Chalmer’s Free Church, the Inde- pendent Chapel, Baptist Chapel and St George’s Anglican Church.21 In Launceston, St John’s Square with its churches was the centre of cele- brations, including religious services, a memorial arch, cake for the children, a loyal procession, the lighting of bonfires, tar barrels and rockets, and dinner for about 100 native-born colonists.22
 Without multiplying the examples, the social taint of ‘convictism’ was an early consequence of the anti-transportation campaign and it related less to the perceived dangers of convicts than to the corruption of all levels of polite society who had made use of their labour. Free colonists were keen to avoid the suggestion that, like the West Indian planters in relation to slavery, they were motivated financially to support the system. On the contrary, they argued, the convict system was an expensive imposition on both the colony and the Crown without delivering any economic benefits to them.
 In the east, a series of government inquiries and moral panic about unnatural crime led to insistence on a high degree of formal separation and classification at all probation stations. Typically, there were individ- ual cells, guards, a chapel and boundaries; most were established as far away from free settlements as possible. A very different landscape was presented in the series of mining sites associated with Horrocks. He was forty-nine, married and a respectable Manchester merchant when he was convicted of forging and uttering two bills of exchange and transported for fourteen years, arriving in Fremantle in January 1852. Horrocks seems to have been a man of considerable entrepreneurial gifts and Methodist leanings. In 1863, at his Gwalla mining settlement, Horrocks built a non-denominational church with separate pulpits for Anglicans and Nonconformists and open to all.41 A text inscribed on a cement tablet – prominently displayed – made its purpose very plain: ‘My house shall be called a house of Prayer for All People’ (Isaiah 56:7).42 Horrocks himself acted as minister until his death and was buried in the cemetery adjacent when he died at the age of fifty-five, six years after being transported to the colony. Churches have been identified at other mining sites associated with Horrox, anticipating the ongoing influence of Methodism in Western Australian mining communities.43

 From the early 1620s, English charters also embraced and anticipated  massive transfers of population as colonization’s purpose. Clearly the first  to do so was Sir William Alexanders’s “New Scotland” grant. Its emphasis  lay on colonization as an act of self-renewal undertaken by a population  “led forth into new territory, which they may fill with colonies.”72 The  sentiment became commonplace.73
 The impact of Blackstone’s Commentaries as a guide to the substance of  English law and procedure and as a stimulus to constitutional contention was  to be assisted by a phenomenon of empire—the networking and peripatetic  careers of colonial officials.24 As Bridget Brereton and John Bennett have  demonstrated in their biographical work, the movement between colonies of  judges with developed views on law and constitutionalism influenced legal  and political discourse in those possessions.25 Moreover, judges who needed  to test their understanding of the law were not shy about making contact with  their counterparts in other colonies who might have faced similar issues.26
 Elite hauteur, manipulation of the levers of colonial governance and  law, and an obsessive fear of disloyalty among the population were evident  in Upper Canada in the years after the War of 1812. The law officers of  the Crown and most of the judges were associated with a group described  as the Family Compact—including colonial officials, businessmen, and  churchmen—committed to preserving and replicating their own high  Tory, anti-democratic values in the governance of the colony.47 For the  Crown lawyers the justice system was a legitimate instrument for neutral- izing or even ridding themselves of those with a different vision of soci- ety. The exclusivist views of these men did not go unchallenged, however.  The presence of reformist lawyers, such as William Warren Baldwin, in  the Assembly in the early 1820s was to introduce the discourse of a more  liberal constitutional tradition, drawing strength from eighteenth-century  English country Whigs, Irish Whig ideology, and expansive readings of  Blackstone. Baldwin went on the attack against the Sedition Act. He argued  that as long as the Act, with its provisions for summary arrest and banish- ment, remained in force Upper Canadians were “without a constitution,  at least a free one.” “The statute,” he continued, “remained in force not  only in the face of Magna Carta, but directly in the face of all the statutes  made for the liberty and protection of the subject.”48 Baldwin began assert- ing that the Constitution Act of 1791 represented a compact between the  Crown and people of Upper Canada (reflecting his own Irish Whig heri- tage and the influence of Thorpe’s thinking), a compact that could not be  altered without the consent of the governed. This latter point represented  a position close to that of the English reformist and radical Whigs of the  mid-eighteenth century.49 Here were the seeds of what became in a short  time the reformers’ manifesto for the grant of responsible government.
 The peoples indigenous to North America did not view sovereignty or  kings this way. These were non-state societies governed through councils  of chiefs and elders representing networks of clans or extended families  within and between villages. Political order was intimately connected to  spiritual order, and both were oriented toward relations of kinship. Kinship  transcended temporal and physical boundaries: trees, water, and animals  were infused with spiritual life—with manitous—and survival necessitated  spiritual balance with them through constant gift-giving. Peaceful rela- tions with the elements of the natural world and peoples within that world  meant establishing and maintaining relationships of spiritual-kinship by  creating reciprocal obligations of care. To give or receive presents was to  renounce the status of alien and to become kin. The snake-manitou met  by the Saulteurs on their way to Niagara was a grandfather and gifts were  needed to ensure its good thoughts. This episode is not unrelated to the  message of the Great Turtle given in the shaking tent, that the Crown’s  representative would fill their canoes with presents. To establish political  relations was to create obligations of care between members of an extended family. To have a wealthy king as father meant having a caring relation  who would provide gifts, offer counsel, and ward off danger.17
 The parliamentary committee, therefore, had ample evidence before it  of the distinctive aboriginal language from Canada of Crown as father.  But the report itself reveals no outward signs that the committee appreci- ated the traditional meaning of that phrase for indigenous peoples, and  its recommendations were wholly consistent with Crown paternalism of  the common law parens patriæ variety. That indigenous peoples in Canada  themselves referred to the Crown as father seems to have reinforced the com- mittee’s vision of the Crown as protector of aboriginal peoples throughout  the empire, if only indirectly or implicitly. In its reports in later years, the  successor to the select parliamentary committee on aborigines, the (extra- parliamentary) Aborigines Protection Society, would continue to advo- cate paternal Crown control of indigenous peoples in British colonies and  would use to this end statements from Indian chiefs in Canada expressing  thanks for the protection of their “great mother the Queen.”56 The pater- nalistic and moralistic ideas advanced by these groups were received sym- pathetically in a colonial office run by the likes of Lord Glenelg and James  Stephen, humanitarians closely linked by family ties to Wilberforce and  the Clapham Sect.57 Over time, this brand of moralistic paternalism would  be woven with other strands into the theory and practice of empire.58 On  an abstract level, it would inform theories of liberal imperialism developed  by utilitarians such as J.S. Mill.59 In practical terms, it would justify par- ticularly aggressive—indeed oppressive and abusive—government policies,  such as the Indian residential school system aimed at the forced assimila- tion of aboriginal peoples into Euro-Canadian society.60
 Part III Frontiers of Justice Samuel Marsden’s Civility  The Transposition of Anglican Civil Authority to Australasia Andrew Sharp I It is appropriate that the study of the colonial transposition of British  government should focus on an array of impersonal and abstract   instruments—sovereignty, occupation, the rule of law, natural rights— not least because such instruments can have quite concrete effects in  establishing the terms of intelligibility and argument for the exercise of  colonial rule. It is no less appropriate, though, that such study should  also investigate the much less abstract and impersonal issue of the “char- acter” or “persona” of those charged with wielding such instruments in  the concrete exercise of government. Eighteenth-century English society  remained firmly under the sway of the Anglican settlement of religious  civil war, which had installed broad-church Anglicanism and the com- mon law as the two central pillars of social government.1 It also remained  a society of “offices”—that is, a society in which duties and rights were  packaged in interlocking role-specific bundles—such that the exercise of  social authority was no abstract matter. It required rather the cultivation of  a specific character or persona—the office-specific personality of the king,  magistrate, parson, midwife, philosopher, husbandman, and so on—that  formed the condition for successful occupancy of an office and the exercise  of its social powers.2 The colonial transposition of English social authority thus took place in and through the movement of particular “official” per- sonages: governors, lawyers, missionaries, soldiers, and magistrates. It is  no surprise then that the office through which the combined authority of  Anglicanism and common law was concretely exercised in England—the  dual office of clergyman and justice of the peace—should have had such  decisive importance for the exercise of this authority in colonial Australia  and New Zealand. It was as the occupant of this double office that Samuel  Marsden (1765–1838) earned his celebrated or notorious place in the his- tory of colonial Australia and New Zealand. He personified the mix of  evangelical rectitude and judicial implacability that was required by the  “character” of his office, even though this has been reduced to the level  of personal foible by an often unsympathetic later historiography. At first,  especially before the Macquarie years, Marsden’s character was, naturally  enough, largely judged by his fellow settlers as a function of his person- ality. It was after all a society in which roles were unclearly differentiated  and taken ad hoc by those who would and could fill them; and so appear- ance, energy, and temperament counted for much. Few appreciated his  office and character: what he lived for and habitually practiced. What is  remarkable is that a politics (and later, a historiography) of personality  continued to provide the frame for judging Marsden’s actions, even after  New South Wales had become an extended society in which offices and  personae had become, in fact, more determinative than individual temper- ament. In attempting to understand the early stages of the transmission of  English legal and religious culture to New South Wales, then, it is vital to  study the man’s office and the character cultivated for it, without reducing  these to personal foible, for it is in the character of pioneers—the auctors of  a new or transplanting society—that lodge the deep structures of control  that they bring with them.
 Many of Marsden’s generation, though, did support the export of  protestant Christianity.4 In London in May 1809, Rev. Legh Richmond  preached to the annual meeting of the Church Missionary Society to  Africa and the East (CMS). He took as his text the injunction of Jesus in  John 11:16 to “Feed my sheep.” He urged his hearers to extend their finan- cial support to the organization’s ramifying missions and to pray for their  success. One of his congregation, Marsden himself was home, busy orga- nizing an Anglican mission to New Zealand. In his sermon, with a strik- ing eloquence that was long remembered,5 Richmond, appropriately to the  occasion, imagined a “statesman,” a “merchant,” a “natural philosopher,”  and a “curious traveler” examining a world map from their separate points  of view. (It is notable that he did not imagine a “colonist,” an uncommon  and unattractive figure at the time).6 The Christian “beholds the world’s  map” in a very different way from the others. “He has a subject of investi- gation far beyond them all. What they have overlooked and disregarded,  is everything to him.” He looks for “the visible kingdom of Christ”; then  he will see “how small a part of those immense tracts of country which the  map presents to his view, so much as know whether there be any Christ!” In fact Marsden had seen the world exactly this way when he first left  for New South Wales in 1793. His diary of the seven-month voyage out  records his single-minded commitment to bring the gospel to the convicts  and to the heathen natives of “New Holland.”7 The salvation of souls was  to be his life’s work. So it was not a new man who left England for the last  time in 1809 to the strains of the “Old Hundredth” Psalm.8 It was simply  one who was reinvigorated by an eighteen-month stay in his homeland  and who now had further flocks in mind: the New Zealanders, and the  growing numbers of convict, free, and freed settlers in New South Wales.
 Under Hunter and King, Marsden was among the most prominent  magistrates of the colony, burdened with a great number of administra- tive as well as pastoral and judicial tasks. His experience led him to offer  his thoughts in three extended papers around 1806, intended for King,  his successor William Bligh, and the authorities in England.22 The papers  discussed unmarried convict women living with men, the toleration of  the Catholic religion among the Irish convicts, and the trade in spirituous  liquors. As a recent writer has shown, Marsden’s opinion of the morals and  law-abidingness of convict women was low; he disapproved of the military  élite’s trading and monopoly in hard liquor as a medium of exchange; and  most of all he abhorred the Irish Catholic convicts.23 Each was excoriated  as a corrupting source of sin and crime.
 Hunter and King felt the same about the Irish: the two continually com- plained to Downing Street of those among them who were sent out for their  parts in the 1798 rebellion. They were “ignorant, obstinate, and depraved,”  “turbulent and worthless characters,” “insolent, refractory, and troublesome,”  “perjurers,” “wicked and disaffected,” “discontented,” and of “troublesome  spirit.” Above all they were “seditious.”24 Marsden, reflecting on his and his  fellow magistrates’ experience of Irish unrest,25 wrote in his Irish paper: The Toleration of the Catholic Religion would not only be dangerous to  the present Inhabitants; and to the Government; but also to the rising  Generation; and would lay the Foundation for future internal Wars and  commotions. The Catholics who have Children . . . would bring them up  in their own Persuasion; and would instil into their Minds all the Hatred  against Church and State, which they themselves possess.
 School teachers would join the clergy in that task: “Men of tolerable  Education and good Morals, who would willing devote their time and  Study to instruct the rising Generation.” Marsden was, then, an integrationist, pursuing a protestant and rural  ideal. He considered it possible to transform the population by the appli- cation of a non-doctrinal ethical Christianity, hardly considering, until  much later, possible Catholic, dissenter, and even Methodist objections to  the Anglican church’s dominating the colony. And these sentiments were  consistent with his record. He had recruited schoolteachers and (mainly  dissenting) pastors for New South Wales among the LMS refugees from  Tahiti and Tonga and organized their payment by both governors and the  Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. He had agitated for the building  and maintenance of churches and schools. He had played a major part in  the founding of a female orphan school, and a female factory for secluding  and educating young women in useful productive skills. In London he was  to promote the continuation and extension of his program of Christian  education and the reform of sexual relations.40

 Mackerel was a vindictive passerby in one of many early modern English  towns. In New South Wales in 1795, the brawl between Boston and the  New South Wales Corps constituted a much more obvious and important  rupture of the illusion of universal Peace. Boston v Laycock occurred in a  nascent colonial town: the only place where a plausible imitation of order  could be maintained. It involved some of the most important and notori- ous free men in the colony: free businessmen and members of the New  South Wales Corps. They represented two major and opposing interests  in a settlement largely comprised of convict men and women who them- selves constituted a threat to public order. When the parties to Boston v  Laycock brawled, everyone saw. When they disagreed in court over how  best to keep the Peace, everyone heard. Indeed, as the participants knew  as much about the law as most of their lay judges, their arguments carried  disproportionate weight in the colony. If Mackerel’s urination showed the  contestability of Peace in early modern England, then this public spat in  early Sydney shook the little colony at its legal foundations.
 These proposals were often aimed at generating commercial and, par- ticularly, political interest and support. To build political coalitions and  to present a “respectable” face to government and the public, promoters  stressed the moral and economic independence offered by emigration as  well as the greater freedom of action offered by colonial settings. In the  case of South Australia and New Zealand, many promoters of coloniza- tion were loosely connected through support for various ideas of “colonial  reform” and “systematic colonization.”4 Such proposals were not without  their critics, particularly given the questionable credentials of prominent  promoters such as Edward Gibbon Wakefield. In British debates colonies  could be presented as being socially fragile, bereft of the stability that long- standing institutions of law, religion, and property might be seen as giv- ing a society. To try to counter such perceptions, systematic colonization  proposals often involved detailed proposals for institutional structures and  constitutional relationships. Such proposals were designed to show respect- able authorship and provide assurances of colonial stability.5
 Altering the law on oaths and evidence had been a recurrent issue among  lobbyists and commentators on imperial affairs in the early nineteenth cen- tury. Issues of slave and indigenous evidence were often of concern to the  Colonial Office. A series of contentious reforms in 1809 and again in 1828  allowed limited categories of unsworn testimony in the Cape Colony, as  part of attempts to assert control over and anglicize Cape institutions and  social structures.17 As Russell Smandych has explored, following the aboli- tion of slavery the office sought to prevent colonial assemblies, restricting  the admissibility of evidence by ex-slaves.18
 Ostensibly “philanthropist” groups set up in association with the South  Australian colonization scheme advocated allowing unsworn indigenous  testimony.19 However, the testimonial capacity of Aborigines was of lim- ited concern to the South Australian lobbyists before the colony’s founding  legislation was passed in 1834. Colonization plans reflected intellectual  currents, but they also reflected political pressures and preoccupations.  The metropolitan promoters of South Australia focused on convicts and   irregular settlers as the colonial challenges facing their schemes. Aboriginal  rights emerged as a late and hurriedly addressed issue.20 However, a  number of systematic colonization lobbyists from the South Australian  scheme moved on to formulate proposals for New Zealand settlements.21  The volume of information available in Britain about New Zealand and  the level of interest in Māori society encouraged promoters to theorize  how Māori society might interact with colonial government and society,  and to use such theorizing as part of political lobbying. Admitting Māori  testimony became a stock means of claiming an informed and “enlight- ened” approach to colonization.22 Nonetheless, references to evidentiary  capacity in colonization proposals had limited impact on government. In  1838 Lord Glenelg deflected New Zealand Company proposals for the  admission of Māori evidence in any new colonial system, saying the issue  was too sensitive to be resolved in the abstract.23 Imperial legislation was  predominately reactive. In the absence of a particular political controversy  there was limited political will to respond to abstract appeals to principle  from London observers, particularly given the self-interest of promoters  seeking to purchase land directly from Māori.24

 Meanwhile, the colonial project as an imperial project was rapidly devel- oping as the British Government increasingly intervened to defend, support and maintain its possessions around the world. Capitalist or ‘company’ colonialism was well underway, not least in India where the East India Company (EIC) controlled extensive territories. By 1840, the missionary project was also in full swing.48 Originally named ‘The Missionary Society’, the LMS had catholic pretensions that lasted well beyond its transition into a decidedly nonconformist, and predominantly Congregationalist, organisation. The seed of the LMS germinated in 1795 during the Evangelical Revival and amidst a flurry of missionary society formation.49 At home, it sprouted substantial sup- port networks facilitated by the proliferation of Britain’s churches and chapels in the first half of the nineteenth century.50 Sunday schools, which attracted high numbers throughout the century, proved par- ticularly fertile ground both in galvanising young fundraisers and providing a forum for the dissemination of missionary propaganda.51
 Early LMS workers in southern Africa tended to be of a working-class, artisanal background.59 There was a high proportion of Scots and some Europeans.60 During the early nineteenth century, LMS missionaries to southern Africa acquired a reputation for sexual improprieties (includ- ing with African women) and hostility to settlers.61 In the 1830s, some campaigned against the effective enslavement of the KhoiKhoi and the post-emancipation vagrancy legislation.62 Reflecting wider enthusiasm for humanitarianism in this period, LMS missionaries contributed to the Aborigines Select Committee’s reports and mobilised networks of infor- mation and patronage to bring the violent abuses of indigenous people by Europeans to the attention of the metropole.63
 The performance of a missionary wife’s civilising duties, however, differed across colonial sites. When Price wrote from Bechuanaland that it was her wifely duty to keep her husband ‘comfortable & his home civ- ilized & Christian-like’, she suggested the crucial role of home-making.49

 Counterfactuals  are,  of  course,  impossible  to  prove. One  cannot  assert,  for  instance, with any degree of certitude, events that did not in fact occur, nor name that centralizing figure  who  might  have  been  India’s  Bismarck,  Mazzini,  Atatürk  or  Garibaldi  in  the absence  of  the British. But  historical  events  find  their  own dramatis  personae,  and  it  is unreasonable to suggest that what happened everywhere else would not have happened in India. From such an initially hybrid system could have emerged a modern constitutional monarchy  and  political  institutions  built  upon  the  Mughal  administrative  system,  as modified by the Marathas. But these are hypotheticals. The British came, and no such non- colonial India emerged.
 Part of the problem was that the Indian social structures were unfamiliar to the British, whose own villages survived in a largely feudalistic relationship to their landlords. Empire was in many ways the vehicle for the extension of British social structures to the colonies they conquered. The socio-political constructs that the British made in their Empire were primarily  reflections  of  the  traditional,  individualistic,  unequal  and  still  class-ridden society that existed in England. The architects of Empire, responding to what they knew, sought  to  recreate  the  rural  arcadia  of Tory England, where  local  government  since  the sixteenth century had been controlled by those with high social prestige and ruled by an established  squirearchy.  Instead  of  the  autonomous  village  governments  the  British dismantled  in  India,  English  villages  were  in  the  hands  of  the  traditional  lords,  the grandees being supplemented by gentry attached to them. The English tried to find similar structures  in  the  traditional  societies  of  their  colonies,  and  when  they  could  not,  they invented  an  approximation  of  them.  Thus  was  born  the  ‘indirect  rule’  system  of government  that  characterized  much  of  the  Empire,  with  power  devolved  to  an  entire hierarchy of greater  and  lesser  imitation  ‘gentlemen’, many given British-invented  titles like ‘Rai Bahadur’ or even knighted (and, in a couple of cases, ennobled) for their pains. This was both less expensive for the Empire and, as with the English system at home, it was  run  by  complicit  amateurs,  so  there  was  no  need  to  create  a  professional  class  of Indians who would wield, and then seek to exercise, political authority.
 Yes,  it  brought  in  a  supposedly  free  press,  but  ensured  it  operated  under  severe constraints,  and  planted  the  seeds  of  representative  parliamentary  institutions  while withholding the substance of power from Indians.

 Across empires ideals of childhood held out the tantalising promise of tying  together societies composed of ‘settlers’ and ‘expatriates’ proclaiming diverse eth- nic affiliations. Recent histories have begun to revise older views of French and  British ‘communities’ in East and Southeast Asia as mere accomplices of impe- rial expansion, revealing these groupings of settlers, businessmen, officials and  religious workers instead as fractured and fissiparous. Robert Bickers, Christian  Henriot, Eric Jennings, J. P. Daughton and others have revealed that they were  rarely committed to any overarching programme or imperial aim.11 In the face  of such diversity, those determined to assert the nation on the ‘frontier’ rallied  behind more aloof genres of colonialism. As they built claims for racial differ- ence upon evidence of the impossibility of white settlement, childhood became a  key resource through which racial difference could be defined. Consequently, the  question of how to raise children in nonsettlement colonies linked the ‘low prag- matism’ of colonialism, as Bickers and Henriot have termed it, with high politics.12
 Far from being the ‘indirect rule’ with which the British Empire was often as- sociated, governance in the British Crown Colonies of Hong Kong and the Straits  Settlements was intentionally direct. Both formed part of an imperial system  with a constitutional structure that confined merchant power, closed off wider  representation and concentrated power in nonelective executive and legislative councils and a governor (who was monitored by the Colonial Office and parlia- ment).76 This system was intended to avoid the pitfalls of ‘older’ colonialisms, in  particular those of British India where large Anglo-Indian and poor white pop- ulations had come to be condemned as a problem, and centres such as Shanghai,  where municipal government endowed ‘settlers’ with a powerful voice.77
 Following the uprising a British parliamentary select committee reappraised  conditions in India. The committee endorsed a new vision of state-run coloni- alism as more distant and aloof. Authorities perceived entanglement—for which  they held settlers primarily responsible—as blurring the lines of racial identity  and eroding authority. This shift heralded a quite different political vision of the  colonial future and one that clashed with the interests of planters in India, many  of whom had raised children there. It was in the teeth of settler resistance to this  new line that medical authorities in the pay of the state marshalled arguments  based upon evidence of children’s health behind attempts to prove the impossi- bility of white settlement. These medical and administrative interventions had the  effect of producing European children in colonial India as the ultimate symbol of  white racial endangerment and of the degenerative impact of the tropics. Young  people’s vulnerability made them exemplars of national cultures whose exotic  bodies served as a site of ‘essential’ civilisational difference. Children’s presence  came to validate claims for the tropics as endangering whites, but also, by exten- sion, assumptions that geographical dislocation offered proof of a civilisational  superiority that was fixed in the environment.14
 The notional distinction between ‘true’ childhood—voiced by Knollys in Hong  Kong—and that which was not childhood in the true sense of the word emerged  in the wake of liberal reformers’ efforts to advance child protection through state  intervention. In the mid-nineteenth century, metropolitan child labour reformers established the economically worthless, domestic childhood as a middle-class  ideal. This ideal was driven into sharper relief after 1870 as evangelical-inspired  activists and school attendance officers laboured to achieve its extension across  class lines. In Britain, Enlightenment thinking had advanced assumptions of the  supposedly essential malleability of children and their special receptiveness to  environmental influences. Reformers therefore focused not only upon longer- term solutions to address the moral and physical problems of the labouring poor,  such as urban renewal, but also on the retrieval and reform of children from  working-class milieux.
 It did not take long for the impact of this social movement to ripple out to  empire, where the Contagious Diseases Acts had originated. The first was im- plemented in 1857 in Hong Kong, while a second, passed in 1867, had provided  police there with additional powers.16 The success of the metropolitan reformers’  campaign tactics soon led them to extend their critique to the colonies. And as  demands for the repeal of the acts extended to empire, so too did other aspects  of the purity movement. The 1880s emerged as a period of reflection upon sin at  home and abroad. Stead’s Pall Mall Gazette published an article in which ‘Public  Servant’ asked, “Is Empire Consistent with Morality?” (He answered the question  with a resounding “No!”)17 For a growing number of critics the male-dominat- ed society of empire ‘commissioned sin,’ and in light of this elite commentators  argued for imperial reform through the introduction of domestic values, that is,  through the presence of wives, families and children.
 Sir John Pope Hennessy, the reform-minded governor of Hong Kong, was  keenly aware of such criticisms. During his governorship (1877–82) the Crown  Colony had repeatedly come under fire from both metropolitan campaigners and  its own liberal-minded chief justice for its lax moral standards. Hennessy himself initiated an inquiry into aspects of Hong Kong’s Contagious Diseases Ordinance  but failed to convince the Colonial Office to repeal it. Struggling to defend the  colonial record amid condemnation of the acts (which remained on the statute)  and evidence of ‘child slavery’ (discussed in Chapter 8), he turned to census data  to argue, “The tropical Colony where European children flourish cannot be very  unhealthy.”18 Drawing a veil over disastrous sanitary conditions, brothel slavery  and other problems, Hennessy connected ‘progress’ with the proliferating pres- ence of European children ‘Out East.’ The governor was not alone in identifying the presence of the European child  as a barometer of imperial-moral health. As the medical and social costs of male  profligacy to British imperialism came under attack, other residents of Brit- ish-governed territories in Asia joined this chorus. Alicia Little, a travel writer,  anti-footbinding campaigner and sometime resident of Shanghai, attacked the  old bachelor-dominated ‘mess system,’ claiming that “the greatest change of all”  was “the superseding of the old hong life by family life. Shanghai is full, happi- ly, now of ladies and children and they have broken up the junior messes.”19 In  Singapore, Dr. David Galloway, a Scottish medical doctor who had arrived in the  Straits in 1895, celebrated children as corroborating the ideal of the dutiful wife  as mother.20 In Hong Kong the chaplain to the resident British armed forces, the  Reverend E. J. Hardy, explained in a lecture of 1903 how “wife and children are a  kind of discipline” in the tropics. For these commentators, children’s presence in  empire was suggestive of a sexually disciplined colonial masculinity. The family  with children, in their view, might provide a far more authentic foundation for  social order built around the home than could bachelorhood in the messes and  chummeries.21 Trans-colonially, ‘true children’ emerged as a corrective to empire’s  ‘spoilt children.’22
 In this vein, in 1889 James Cantlie, by then one of Hong Kong’s foremost medi- cal doctors, declared before a meeting of the Hong Kong Literary Society, “A home means in its essential sense a place wherein children can be reared.”23 Having  arrived in Hong Kong two years earlier with his wife and baby son, Cantlie was  himself engaged with the challenge of realising the colonial home. Whilst in the  metropole, he had authored Degeneration amongst Londoners (1885) and played a  leading role in ‘Tropicalising’ readings of the labouring poor in London’s slums.24  In Hong Kong, this prominent though controversial supporter of the domestica- tion of metropolitan male working-class culture underlined the essentially degen- erative impact of the tropical environment upon children’s health. Nevertheless  he clung, like Hennessy, to the notion of the child as barometer of the moral health  of a community being redefined in terms of ‘exile.’ The commentaries of Cantlie and others drew their power from metropolitan  notions of mother and child as a powerful moral unit. These had deep historical  roots, being tangled up in Britain with Puritan traditions of the family and mar- riage. From the 1840s, evangelical writers, congregational ministers, temperance  and moral reformers and physicians invoked ideals of the family as an affective  relationship, and the home as a sacred and intimate space, separated from the  outside world of work, competition, the market and politics. Adultery and com- mercial sex embodied in the figure of the prostitute or ‘public woman’ contra- vened the spiritual essence of reproductive sexual union in the home. Through  the close links it developed with the reform of labour practices, philanthropy  and evangelicalism, childhood for some educated observers came to represent an  essentially ethical space, a space of innocence and one ideally to be protected.25  As James Cantlie was at pains to emphasise, in the tropics it was children and not  their mothers who assumed the mantle of supreme referents of the ‘home,’ and  by extension European civilisational superiority.
 Members of the influential and ideologically diverse French colonial lobby  (or Union Coloniale Française) found the prospect of settlement in ‘new France’  tantalising. As Marie-Paule Ha has shown, lobbyists threw their weight behind a  fin de siècle campaign promoting women’s emigration to the colonies, organised  by the Société Française D’Émigration des Femmes.55 While others supported  emigration partly as a solution to fin de siècle problems of depopulation and  a ‘blocked’ metropolitan marriage market, the colonial lobbyist Joseph Chail- ley-Bert identified it as a means of ensuring that the French colonial presence in  Asia would not only persist but take on a higher social tone. In the propaganda  whipped up around this campaign supporters advocated the careful selection of  women capable of ‘improving’ colonial societies which were considered at this  time in France to comprise felons, frauds and fruits secs. But the presence of  these women was also a means to an end: the production of a new generation of  children capable of upholding and performing Frenchness authentically in a way  that critics argued mixed-race children born of unions between male colonials  and native women were not.
 British doctors and hygienists in Hong Kong and Singapore dwelt primarily on tropicality as a threat to population quality to be resolved by an early return to the  metropole. Assumptions about gender in empire and the imperative of return led  them to concede somewhat greater authority to mothers over their own children.  By contrast, in Hanoi and Saigon some experts identified the management of  childhood in the tropics as fundamental to aspirations that empire might form  part of a project of national regeneration. Hence, at a time when in the metro- pole French men increasingly conceded responsibility for their children to an  emerging partnership between women and the interventionist republican state,  in colonial contexts where the state was weaker and culture was more male-dom- inated and masculinist, experts and fathers reasserted paternal responsibility for  colonial childhood.
 Cultural Contagions: Children in the Colonial home s In the late imperial era childrearing came to be identified as exemplary of moral  order and good governance came to be more closely linked to domestic values.  The home emerged as a site of colonial power, and in the process children took  on a social and cultural significance that far outstripped their numerical presence  in the tropics. As adults recast children as exemplars of supposedly homogeneous  national cultures, their actions within the home—their encounters with native  servants, nursemaids, and others—began to attract interest at the highest levels  of colonial society. As we have seen, hygienists, some of whom viewed children as  ‘perfected degenerates’ and others as ‘acclimated auxiliaries,’ became deeply con- cerned with childrearing practices. And yet these experts were only too well aware  that they lacked influence over the shape and structure that colonial childhoods  ultimately took within the home. In practice, as this chapter argues, childhood in  colonial contexts was profoundly porous, mixed and disruptive of the very claims  for racial homogeneity that it was called upon to impart.
 To be sure, such checks constantly broke down. For instance, European chil- dren overcame incomprehension by learning Asian languages or pidgin English.  Some taught their amahs European languages too. Though common languages emerged, Europeans checked amahs’ authority by denigrating these as essentially  ‘childish.’ From the mid-nineteenth century, Canton pidgin English was frequent- ly derided by European observers as a “gross caricature of the language of the  nursery” and a “barbarous and childish patois.”25 By construing pidgin, which  by the turn of the century had all but disappeared from commercial domains, as  an essentially childish tongue used in the home, commentators accommodated  it within British elite assumptions about childhood as a separate ‘world,’ distinct  from that of adults.
 In this regard, the child-servant relationship mirrored the child-environment  relationship discussed in Chapter 2. Since Asian servants were often regarded as  ‘outgrowths’ of this environment, this is hardly surprising. Both relationships  locked children into a trajectory leading inevitably to degeneracy and the end  of innocence. But both were also ultimately productive of British elite colonial  culture. They affirmed middle-class women’s elite status and underpinned the  orthodoxy of sending children ‘Home.’ This allowed colonial homes to remain  primarily spaces of childhood. The adolescent in the colonial home by contrast  embodied the alarming prospect that intimate relations set down across lines of  class and race might persist into adulthood. Lord Northcliffe, visiting Singapore,  summed this problem up quite succinctly, and its solution, when he noted: “The  European children here seem happy. I saw them playing today guarded by their  Chinese or Malay amahs of whom they are very fond. These nurses spoil them,  however, and they have to be ordered home when they are seven years of age.”36
 In Hong Kong, Singapore and other contexts, childhood had come to be close- ly linked to moral reform. In effect, the colonial childhood rested upon theories  of disease conflating physical and moral health and dirtiness. These produced the  Chinese child as distinct, as the quote from Phoebe May above illustrates. With  purity under threat, from outside and inside, ideal childhood required displace- ment beyond the impure. Prophylactic measures intended to control microbes,  pathogens and disease vectors focused upon the invasive agency of the Asian (and Eurasian) child. The resulting interventions underpinned assumptions that  ‘public’ health was secured in domestic spaces. But paradoxically, as this view of  childhood was elaborated trans-colonially, it produced efforts toward the hy- gienic regulation of the home in British contexts that were notably less didactic  than in Saigon and Hanoi.
 In January 1861 F. R. Kendall, an agent for the Peninsular and Oriental Steam  Navigation Company resident in Singapore observed, “No one here seems to take  an interest in Christmas somehow. . . . There is nothing to remind one of the sea- son at all.”5 When Charles Buckley organised his first Christmas gathering a few  years later it drew only twenty participants, mostly from his small Sunday school  class at St. Andrew’s Church. However, the celebration soon began to attract wider  interest. Buckley’s philanthropic gesture resonated among members of the small  merchant-dominated community as it gave greater public prominence to a cer- tain idea of British leadership and civil values at a moment when Singapore’s  elite was seeking to draw closer to London. Singapore had long been an Indian  dependency, but by the mid-1860s its merchants were petitioning London for  separate Crown Colony status. Before the onset of formal colonial rule in 1867 the  shared ambition to break free of rule by the East India Company sustained the early development of collaborative interethnic relations between European elites,  Chinese merchants (towkay) and English-speaking ‘Straits Chinese.’ In Singapore,  permanent communities of Chinese (mainly of Hokkien descent) predated for- mal British rule, as did the ‘Peranakan,’ Malay-speaking ancestors of early mi- grants from Penang and Malacca. Though they had resided in port cities of Asia  for centuries and married into Malay communities, this group retained aspects  of Chinese identity. However, many Chinese emigrants who settled also became  part of an Anglophone community and took on key roles in the growing admin- istrative and commercial life of the city. For example, Chinese merchants emerged  as members of government boards and voluntary institutions and as justices of  the peace. The Singapore Chamber of Commerce, the only formal organisation  of the early colonial period, created in February 1837 to communicate with the  London government, was open to all.6
 Far from confining themselves to domestic interiors, educated women were at  this time taking an increasingly prominent role in public.33 In British elite culture  new notions of childhood, sentimentalised and sacralised, were an accompani- ment to the domestic ideal of womanhood. The stark contrast between this elite  norm and the ‘waifs and strays,’ ‘hooligans’ or ‘street arabs’ who could not live  up to it galvanised a flurry of action intended to improve the condition of poor  children. Evangelical reformers increasingly saw their own children as adjuncts  in a battle to reverse the secularisation of society, and to raise its moral tone.  The initiatives of middle-class organisers such as the Boys’ Clubs and Institute  movement that had emerged in London in the 1870s and the Boys’ Brigade (1883)  reflected the desire to tap the energies of children and to address the yawning class  divide. Some feared that if evangelical zeal did not infect the younger generation  of ‘smart little children,’ momentum would be lost.
 Carabelli’s proposal and the response it received were also significant for the  light they shed upon a wider and increasingly bitter battle over whom or what  Indochina was actually for. In the metropole republicans and Catholics had by  now drawn battle lines penetrating the home. For each, the family offered a model around which society might be reorganised, and children figured prom- inently in their competing visions of the nation. For republicans children were  model democratic citizens-in-training, as the antislavery campaigner Victor  Schœlcher had famously suggested.59 For Catholics the family was a space for  the socialising of children and countering secularism. In a context of growing  religious strife in France the influential work of the late mining engineer and  conservative sociologist Frédéric Le Play informed a rising tide of right-wing  criticism blaming the decline of patriarchy upon an effeminising, egalitarian  republic.60 As J. P. Daughton has shown, these debates also played out at one  remove in colonial space. And here, in centres where patriarchal ideologies re- mained deeply ingrained, the colonial government’s willingness to entertain  notions of children as partners or auxiliaries of the state raised fears over a direct  threat to Catholic authority.61
 revolutionary philosophical tradition, from the ‘assimilationist’ approach of Paul  Bert to the more aloof ‘association’ of Jules Harmand. Casting the colonised as  a child sidestepped the oxymoron of an aristocratic republican rule and neatly  encapsulated the shift away from assimilation toward an associative line.
 Young people’s prominence in the public disturbances of the postwar era  posed a special problem for colonial elites. They had made children and child- hood symbolically central to justifications of liberal imperialism. But in the ear- ly twentieth century the young generation appeared to be leading anticolonial protest. Reform-minded Asian elites grasped for the symbolism of childhood  as they pursued nation-building agendas. Moreover, newly created international  organisations, in particular the League of Nations in Geneva (founded in January  1920), championed universal ideals of childhood as a basis upon which to rebuild  the postwar order. Drawing at times upon the moral leverage of such new inter- national agencies, Asian reformers highlighted disparities between Western and  non-Western childhoods and critiqued prewar narratives of empire as paternal  and benevolent. These criticisms exposed the peril of building justifications of  liberal governmentalities around appeals to unstable categories of youth.
 In the years before Duy Tân came to the throne, the conditions that led French  officials to arrange his accession took shape. At the turn of the century, cross-bor- der links with Canton, ironically facilitated by French modernisation projects, enabled young reform-minded individuals to tap into new ideas about mod- ernisation in the restive territories of northern Vietnam. The Qing emperor’s  abortive ‘Hundred Days Reform’ of China from 1898 provided inspiration. These  reforms resonated with special force among young intellectuals in northern Vi- etnam because here Chinese cultural influence remained evident in Vietnamese  traditions, institutions and beliefs. The ongoing battle for reform in China con- tinued to inspire young antiforeign and reform-minded elements in Vietnam  who were convinced that the limits of traditional sociopolitical organisation had  been reached.
 In the early 1920s, in centre after centre organisers struggled to start league  branches up again or closed them down definitively. In Singapore the Ministering  Children’s League shrank back within the confines of St. Andrew’s Cathedral be- fore finally closing in the autumn of 1923, with “no hope of revival.”27 In Penang,  the branch closed in 1922 but reopened in 1924, though by the early 1930s its  membership had slipped to just thirty children. This mirrored a general decline  in the organisation’s global membership to four hundred branches and 24,000  members and associates by 1924.
 Social networks linked the Kuk with the Tung Wah ‘Chinese Hospital,’ the ultimate  symbol of elite Chinese philanthropy in Hong Kong. Within and around these  institutions a coherent, local and mostly self-made elite emerged. As Elizabeth  Sinn has shown, many of its members saw philanthropy as “an instrument that  makes financial worth symbolically equivalent to moral worth” and believed that  the “dispensation of charity legitimises the accumulation of wealth.”37 The dy- namism of the league in Hong Kong following the admission of Chinese girls to  its structures reflected its value to these wealthy entrepreneurs. Class may have  failed to function as a bridge to interracial mixing in other social settings, as John  Carroll has shown (and Chinese continued to be excluded from European club  memberships for adults), but the league offered a space where elite Chinese and  European children could act as something closer to equals.38
 As the colonial government’s interventions in areas such as immigration pol- icy raised fears among Chinese that their interests and privileges were being en- croached upon, spokesmen for the Straits Chinese used Baby Shows to reassert  their claims upon modern, elite standards of living. Those who took up this task  were, significantly, among the most forward-looking and intellectually engaged  sections of Chinese society. The Nanyang Chinese Students Society (with the  support of the Children’s Aid Society) emerged to take over the running of Baby  Shows in Singapore by 1934. The events modelled a radically denaturalised, trans- formative conception of Chineseness predicated upon the disciplined hygienic  modernness of the child, and a vision of the family as a unit of consumption  and not only production.69 Chinese organisers proved far less anxious to insulate  children and childhood against the commercial orientation of the shows. Held  at the site of the Great World Cabaret, fancy dress competitions, concerts and  commercial goings-on all but overshadowed the medical authority on display.
 ‘generat ional tensions’ :   saigon and the semaines  de l’enfance As wider tensions unsettled established iconographies of colonial childhood,  new visions emerged to shore up the administration’s disintegrating moral claims for empire. The most important centre in this was again Saigon, as the principal  venue for open intellectual critiques of colonialism. Because Saigon’s elites resided  in a colony, not a protectorate, more liberal-minded residents anticipated their  city might play a key role in evidencing ‘progress.’ Here Cochinchinese elites used  public print media and other means to discuss international affairs, and there  had long been a greater sense of contact with Europe. Urban intellectuals also  wrote about the extremes of wealth and poverty they observed. They refracted  their reflections through new political lenses as they engaged with the question  of how France was treating the races whose progress it championed. A rising  tide of criticism, both French and Vietnamese, provided a mutual stimulus to  philanthropic action.83
 intimate heights: Children, Nature and Colonial urban planning s In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Europeans looked to the man- agement of the middle-class home and public displays of children in new rituals to  evidence a general reordering of empires along more ‘moral’ lines. But as children  migrated toward the epicentre of colonialisms’ cultures, elites extrapolated ideals  of childhood from the home into planning policies launched from the highest  levels of the colonial state. In particular, stakeholders marshalled childhood be- hind deeply controversial projects for the segregation of space. Demands for racial  enclaves turned quite explicitly upon the needs of children, or more specifically  what adults defined as their needs. The management of space emerged as another  crucial domain in which elite ideals of childhood linked up with colonial policy  and transformed the relationship of empire.
 However, this new disease paradigm never entirely overcame indifference and  even resistance within the Colonial Office and the colonies. New theories of the  vectoral propagation of disease only slowly won adherents in the colonies. Be- cause bacteriology connoted special expertise and planning at one remove, it sat  uneasily with the pragmatism that the British claimed to cherish in their empire.  The new perspective from the laboratory—hidden in the field—was one that  allowed foreign experts to rival the authority of administrators. It jarred with  desires to hem back social commitments by the state, and conflicted with visions  of imperial authority grounded in established environmental interpretations of  racial vulnerability, and their associated hierarchies. Instead of bringing about ex- tensive investment in public health, these new findings therefore often informed  planning interventions that shored up established orthodoxies. One of them was  that safety lay in the imposition of greater social and physical distance, not simply  between coloniser and colonised but between wealthier and less wealthy sections  of the populace.10 As planners sought to realise prophylactic segregation in major  centres in British Asia, these tensions inspired a revival of enclaves built around  the fragile, contested constituency of the European child.
 Claud Severn and his successors were well aware that measures intended to  split ‘settler’ sentiment might incur the wrath of elite Chinese. However, they seem  to have remained optimistic that the most important sections of Chinese opinion  would ultimately accept another reservation. This was perhaps partly because, as  we saw in Chapter 5, childhood was by this time reaching new levels of significance  as the focal point of a vibrant culture of elite, interethnic collaboration.74
 The presence of agricultural colonists had a far-reaching impact upon the  social tone of expatriate communities. Planters had grown accustomed to seeing  themselves as a kind of ‘landed gentry’ in British Malaya. However, as rubber pric- es bottomed out, their growing precariousness compelled them to divest many  trappings of elite family life. They cancelled plans to take home leave and to send  children home to be educated. As the crisis lengthened, planters complained of  feeling that “most married people are to be marooned here for ever.”115 In these  circumstances some began to emphasise a more radical line and they marshalled  dystopic visions of the degenerate European child behind a campaign for eco- nomic redress.
 After writing again to the Straits Times on 24 September to condemn confessional  groups, Allan (or his associates) drew the row to the attention of the Protestant  Educational Institute in London (established to ‘fight Popery’ in England), which  took up the case with the Colonial Office.18 The Colonial Office demanded that  the governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Frederick Weld, make a full report to  colonial secretary, Edward Stanhope, on 24 January 1887.
 As we can see, in the face of provocative claims for the toleration of child slavery  across Asia, British and French officials developed quite similar, defensive re- sponses. As moral reform swept onto the metropolitan agenda, in Britain after the  outcry over the Contagious Diseases Acts and the scandal created by W. T. Stead’s  exposé on child prostitution or “white slavery,” and in France as successive gov- ernments sought to establish the secular values of a modernising republicanism,  European and Asian merchants in empire centres feared these revelations might provoke heavy-handed metropolitan intervention. So too did colonial officials  keen to preserve stability and to avoid ‘unnecessary’ expenditure. However, flat  denials that slavery could not exist where it had no legal status were no longer suf- ficient. Therefore, instead of attacking what Smale, Allan, Silvestre and Landes had  all identified as linked practices of child cession, domestic servitude and brothel  slavery, colonial governments eschewed abolitionist intervention and played for  time or used orientalist arguments to deflect criticism.
 Effectively sinicising what was patently a community-wide problem required  more careful official oversight in more ethnically plural Singapore than it did  in Hong Kong. Consequently, in Singapore the Kuk came to be seen not as a  Chinese philanthropic initiative but as “a Government scheme worked by the  Chinese Protectorate.”27 Acting colonial secretary C.W.S. Kynnersley boasted, “No  Chinaman is employed in a position of authority higher than a Revenue officer  or a detective.”28 And while European suspicions of the Po Leung Kuk in Hong  Kong resulted in a critical enquiry into its work, when Elizabeth Andrew and the American medical missionary Dr. Katherine Bushnell complained in 1894 that “a  systematic slave trade in girls exists at Singapore,” the government flatly refused  an enquiry into the Straits Kuk.29
 The Colonial Office was prepared to accept this line, but in the febrile postwar  context reform-minded evangelical progressives infused with the sense that the  moment for change had arrived, were not. Soon after, Hugh Haslewood, a lieuten- ant commander of the Royal Navy posted to the Naval Chart Depot, and his wife,  Clara, who arrived in the colony in the summer of 1919, emerged as vociferous  critics of the phenomenon. Alerted to the issue by a sermon delivered at St. John’s  Cathedral on the subject of girl bond servants, Clara Haslewood publicised their  plight by writing a series of letters to Hong Kong newspapers castigating colonial  authorities for tolerating “child slavery.”58
 Frustrated by their inability to undermine this defence, the Haslewoods began  to emphasise the mui tsai system as synonymous with the abuse of young children.  By focusing on a specific, age-related vulnerability, they linked their cause to a  lively contemporaneous debate over adoption in Britain and abuses stemming  from regulatory shortcomings.60 By locating bond service at the extreme end of a  range of objectionable forms of labour impacting upon children under colonial  rule, they also connected their campaign to noisy, concurrent condemnations of  child labour in other colonial contexts, notably evangelical-led protests in other  major centres along the China coast.61 These aligned neatly with the critiques of  influential experts in Geneva keen to monitor colonial governments’ ‘civilising’  claims.
 The Haslewoods tapped into a narrative of child rescue that had special reso- nance in the British metropolitan context. From the 1830s, British reformers’ as- sertions that every child had the right to an ideal childhood advanced in conjunc- tion with demands for labour reform. In struggles to extend legislative protection  and free, compulsory education, reformers constructed childhood as vulnerable  and ideally noneconomic, protected and happy. Evidence of the denial of this ideal  presented moral reformers with a powerful tool. And as the Haslewoods and their  supporters drew upon the emotive weight of the unfree child, the momentum  began to shift in their favour.62
 The Hong Kong government and its defenders were on difficult ground. Leo  Amery, undersecretary of state for the colonies, found himself defending bond  service as a customary ‘unfreedom’ comparable to that of a ‘normal’ British child- hood, arguing, “I do not think that even in this country either adopted or other  children can always get away as freely as they would like, and perhaps that is  sometimes a good thing for them.”65 Amery’s point was that the notion of a ‘free’  child was nonsensical, predicated as it was upon the suspension of liberty within  the authoritarian structure of the family. However, equating the ideal childhood  in Britain to bond service in China was risky at a time when reformers were draw- ing attention to the most lurid aspects of the mui tsai system and childhood had  emerged at the forefront of liberal internationalist efforts to reshape the postwar  order. Moreover, by now in Hong Kong an increasingly vociferous ‘Anti–Mui Tsai  Society’ (established in September 1921) led by Chinese Christians with support  from local labour guilds was undermining a defence based upon cultural sensi- tivity to ‘Chinese’ norms and values. Dismantling the mui tsai system was a key  goal of nationalists and Christian Chinese who identified childhood as crucial to  nation building. In August the same year, Dr. Yeung Shiu Chuen, who became the  society’s secretary, attacked the system as inimical to Chinese ‘prestige’ and ‘civili- sation,’ and as “producing a low grade nation.”66 In 1922 the group appealed to the  Legislative Council for abolition on the grounds that mui tsai were slaves. With  the orientalist defence in tatters the government in London finally decided to act.
 This shift came about in part because, as Rachel Leow has also argued, the  report presented new evidence that unfree child labour existed not only among  Chinese but also among others, notably the Malay.83 The trans-racial dimensions  of this problem had long been known, as revealed by the case of Elizabeth above.  So what prompted the government to dispense with the older convenience of  the orientalist mui tsai strategy and to embrace the report? Crucially, by the late 1930s new circumstances connected the fate of unpaid child labourers to wider  debates over public health, the controversial issue of the Singapore naval base and  the ‘United Malaya’ project. In 1919 embarrassing revelations of the government’s  toleration of brothels led to metropolitan criticism of Singapore as the ‘Cesspool  of the East.’84 The government would eventually ban prostitution in 1927 and make  brothels illegal in 1930. But these measures did not prevent venereal disease and  they motivated the pugnacious Straits Settlements Association and its allies to  launch public attacks upon brothel closure. These campaigners rejected the ‘ex- pertise’ of ‘do-gooders’ “sitting at the other side of the world” and even demanded  the reenactment of the Contagious Diseases Ordinance.85
 In a context where serious political concessions were impossible the gov- ernment by now urgently required new evidence to underpin its claims to be a  ‘benevolent bureaucracy.’88 However, this need stemmed less from the need to  address Chinese protests than from desires to accelerate ‘decentralisation,’ a policy  intended to bring the Malay Peninsula more closely under British control. Much  earlier, in 1926, Governor Laurence Guillemard (1919–27) had set out this goal by  insisting that the “various parts of Malaya can only attain their full development  by working together as members of one united Malaya.”89 Picton-Turbervill’s re- port emerged at a time when Governor Shenton Thomas sought a means of ad- dressing both the political controversy of the ‘Social Question’ and the challenge  of unification.
 This was why, when the furore over mui tsai had risen again in 1929, officials  in Hong Kong had leapt to ‘fairyland’s’ defence. G.E.J. Gent of the Colonial Of- fice received reports of new voluntary initiatives, pushing out the boundaries of  charitable child welfare still further. These included the establishment of a Hong  Kong branch of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children  (NSPCC).96 Others, such as the police-run Waifs and Strays club, also emerged as  part of this defensive reaction. The governor of Hong Kong, Sir Cecil Clementi, a  staunch opponent of the compulsory inspection of mui tsai, presided at the inau- gural meeting of Hong Kong’s branch of the SPCC in January 1930. According to  him, the allocation of funds demonstrated the colonial government’s attachment  of “so much importance to this matter [the protection of children].”97 Soon after,  Clementi left Hong Kong to take up the governorship of the Straits Settlements,  but he continued to describe the mui tsai legislation as a disaster for poor children,  whom he believed were better catered for as bond servants within the elite family.98
 Official histories of Hong Kong emerging in the 1930s set up paternal coun- terclaims to female reformers’ demands by recasting British colonial governance  within a surprisingly sentimental frame. Officials here had long eschewed meta- phors of nature or kinship in preference for a discourse of development as ration- al, technologically competent progress. This had often portrayed Hong Kong as a  triumph over nature, a ‘barren rock’ transformed into a showcase of British-led  modernisation.99 Now, however, officials began to indulge in paternal referenc- es to the Crown Colony’s former ‘infancy.’ It was significant that their gaze was  retrospective, that they claimed to be looking back on the child-colony from the  perspective of a present in which it was already ‘mature’ (in contrast to a young  and turbulent China over the border). For such views negated justifications for external intervention and ushered female reformers towards the anachronistic  position of belittling a colony that had already ‘grown up.’100
 Part of the reason was because religious authorities in France, Hanoi and Sai- gon were far less inclined than their British equivalents to use evidence of ‘unfree’  children to attack the colonial government. Historians reflecting on the charac- teristics of antislavery movements more generally, prior to and during this peri- od, have contrasted a powerful British antislavery movement possessing a broad,  evangelical mass power base with a French equivalent suffering from long-stand- ing divisions.119 Certainly, the establishment of Cardinal Lavigerie’s Anti-Slavery  Society in 1888 had seen the French Catholic Church overcome associations of  abolition with revolution to emerge at the forefront of a reinvigorated metropol- itan antislavery movement. However, the society focused its efforts largely upon  western and equatorial Africa—areas of empire where Christian influence had yet  to be consolidated—not Indochina, where the French Catholic presence in Asia  long predated, and inspired, formal colonial rule.
 Moreover, as the republican state rolled back clerical privilege at home, rep- resentatives of the Church preferred to work tactfully, not confrontationally,  alongside authorities in the colonies.120 In Saigon and Hanoi religious authorities  enjoyed support from influential figures within the administration and used sub- tle pressure rather than open propaganda to address controversial social issues.121  The Anti-Slavery Society adopted a notably emollient tone in correspondence  with Governor Albert Sarraut, dismissing allegations that slavery was still tolerat- ed in Indochina.122 Perhaps this is unsurprising, since the society’s president from  11 October 1909 was none other than Charles-Marie Le Myre de Vilers, Cochinchi- na’s first civil governor, who had failed to act on Silvestre and Landes’s calls to  openly confront child slavery.
 The quite different political preoccupations of French feminist-led and  left-orientated antitrafficking organisations were also important in obstructing the emergence of a broad-based challenge to the official line. Metropolitan anti- trafficking movements (with which various feminist groups aligned) had taken  up leading positions in international efforts in this field before the First World  War. Like the British women’s movement, the French antitrafficking movement  had developed out of late-nineteenth-century fears over the abduction of women  into prostitution, or la traite des blanches. Campaigners identified the toleration of  brothel registration as the primary cause of this problem. In Britain, the success  of the women’s movement in achieving the repeal of the Contagious Diseases  Acts encouraged a broader focus. After winning suffrage through the 1918 Rep- resentation of the People Act (at least for women over thirty), British reformers  could afford to turn their attention to improving the condition of other vulnera- ble groups, notably children, empire-wide. In contrast, French feminists suffered  repeated setbacks in the struggle for suffrage and other social and legal rights and  this severely curtailed the scope of their demands.127
 Alice Conklin has persuasively argued that the French perceived their com- mitment to safeguarding freedom in the colonies as qualitatively superior to that  of other nations. Republican France, she notes, “prided itself, and its colonialism,  as achieving, if nothing else, an end to slavery in its colonies.”136 With economic  difficulties threatening to fragment the liberal centre in Europe critical voices fell  quiet. At a time when a broad consensus was emerging in metropolitan France  that empire was quintessentially humane, even critics such as Viollis appeared to  be “inhibited by her own Republicanism” while those on the left, such as Lou- is Roubaud, vaunted colonisation as the “essential condition for success” in the  antislavery campaign, and proposed cooperation on this front between British  Malaya, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Siam.137
 From the early 1920s colonial officials had begun to slant reports sent to League  inspectors in this direction. Questionnaire replies typically indicated, “Police ac- tion is very delicate in affairs relating specifically to the Chinese.”144 If this was a problem, it was largely one of the government’s own making. From 1871 to 1885  the French authorities permitted Chinese in Indochina to establish congrégations,  organised on the basis of language and ethnicity and endowed with powers to  police, tax, assist, educate and repatriate members.145 Membership of the five large  Chinese congregations was heavily concentrated in Saigon and Cholon. When  French police did make efforts to challenge Chinese privilege and regulate vice, as  in Cholon in 1903 and 1912, community leaders’ protests ensured that such initi- atives were swiftly curtailed.146 Congregations successfully resisted the regulation  of domestic life, securing exemption from legislation registering servants in 1904  and scuppering plans for a regular immigration service in 1906.147
 British antislavery campaigners, in concert with Chinese Christians and other  reformers, exposed orientalist arguments and used universalist visions of child- hood to challenge colonial authority. Though the campaigners’ principal focus  was Hong Kong, the colonial government based in Singapore eventually moved  first to dismantle the orientalist defence and then embrace a wide-ranging com- mitment to protect the welfare of child colonial subjects. By contrast, in Saigon  and Hanoi, even after colonial government and League reports revealed direct  links between trafficking and prostitution, no similar official reevaluation of the  state’s commitment to Asian children followed. For here, evidence of ‘unfree’  children posed a more potent threat to a form of governance more closely asso- ciated with an ideology of humanitarian ethics, but also one facing anticolonial  movements rejecting the French nation as a source of benevolent enlightenment.
 From this vision of an unrealised past, segregated schools emerged as a solution  preempting a dystopic future. They would permit the realisation of an ideal of  childhood, while usefully concealing the failings of those whose performance of  it fell short.
 Leaders of the Church and missionary groups in Hong Kong found the in- troduction of flagrant racial legislation disquieting. The Anglican bishop, Joseph  Hoare, opposed the segregationist policy and resigned from the education com- mittee in protest before it even completed its work. That he should take this  view is unsurprising given religious workers’ adherence to universalist Christian  ideals presupposing the equality of children before God. Catholics opened many  schools in China but more often established orphanages, evidently influenced by  assumptions of sacramental grace; that baptism in infancy equated to salvation.  A romantic Catholic tradition of childhood elaborated in the aftermath of the  French Revolution sometimes figured baptised children as a pure spiritual force.  As D. E. Mungello has shown using the example of the promotional materials  of the Holy Childhood Association, such a view could efface racial divisions be- tween children rather than undergirding them. Evangelical Protestants of the  LMS and the low-church Anglican ‘Church Missionary Society’ did not always  accept Catholic claims of sacramental grace, and preferred to emphasise Bible  study as a route to salvation and belief in adulthood. However, as evangelical  opinion had hoved away from uncritical acceptance of the doctrine of original  sin, childhood also emerged as an ideal site for Protestant action, for the ‘rescue’  and reform of individuals, and their preparation for doing the work of God.63
 In these empire centres debates surrounding education raised children’s  awareness of age as a key category of experience and societal transformation. For  many young Chinese, events in Paris on 4 May 1919 lit the touch paper. The refus- al of the Allies to support Chinese claims for the restitution of Kiachow triggered  the May Fourth Movement. This spilled over into Singapore where Chinese stu- dents took to the streets on 19 June 1919. The government imposed martial law.  After this Chinese students conspicuously refused to celebrate the Allied victory  on 19–20 July 1919. In 1917 the introduction of guoyu (National Language) in  teaching at Chinese schools, such as the one funded by Tan Kah Kee and Lim Nee  Soon, revealed links between diasporic Chinese youth and the new republican  government of China. This raised fears that the Communist-influenced Kuo- mintang government in Canton held sway over the students. As revolutionaries  brought in antiforeign texts, schools became battlegrounds for the Kuomintang  and the Chinese Communist Party. The self-identification of children as ‘youth’  raised the possibility of links across a ‘generation’ incorporating workers and stu- dents of both sexes in an alliance of age.
 Moreover, lurking behind Brévié’s vision of a racially plural but culturally  French elite was the assumption that ‘pure’ French youth would quite “natural- ly” take the lead. In 1939 the official report on the “General Conclusions of the  Inquiry on the Child of Indochina” reiterated this quite explicitly by stipulating  that French youth had “a great role of initiative to play” in working up what was  described as a “kind of colonisation infantile.”130 This vision of leadership by youth  would be given much fuller expression after July 1940 under the pro-Vichy regime  of Governor General Jean Decoux.131
 The solution Haffner proposed to this problem lay in the very gardens under  his direction. In a detailed plan sent to the lieutenant governor of Cochinchina,  Augustin Fourès, he sought funding for what he called an ‘agricultural orphanage.’  Haffner proposed an experiment in which Eurasian youth would be schooled in  the Botanical Gardens to become a new cadre of farmers. ‘His’ orphans, taught  en paillote in a four-year course, would learn techniques that would enable them  to bring the fertile lands of the heights and plains into productive relation. This,  Haffner hoped, would solve the familiar problem of finding new crops suitable  for export (the only really successful export so far was rice, a fact which he blamed  on indigenous cultivators’ innate conservatism). The director felt sure young Eur- asians would become willing experimenters and a “leader class in agriculture.”  An additional benefit was that they would not suffer the same deleterious effects  as ‘full-blooded’ Europeans through exposure to the environment. As ‘hybrids’  themselves, Haffner also somehow imagined the orphans would be more ‘natural- ly’ predisposed to mastery of the techniques of greffe la selection and hybridisation.  And by lessening French reliance upon the Chinese and disseminating modern  techniques among the Vietnamese, he argued they would help to improve colonial  relations. Rounding off this unsettling combination of domestic and imperial  economics, Haffner argued that the harvests the orphans produced would ensure  that the whole project paid for itself after just a few years.9
 Because the society was voluntary and did not depend upon government fund- ing, it not only won official sponsorship but could also gesture toward quite radical  aims, such as ‘emancipating’ the métis into Frenchness, that is, full citizenship.13 A  speech by the president of the ‘active committee,’ Nicolaï, published in the journal  Mékong on 20 May 1894, identified the métis as the potential basis of colonial society  for “it is there, among the offspring of our elders that we will find the heart, the  soul of our new France, this new France that, today, we have the duty of raising in  our own image, kneaded from our own flesh and blood.”14 Even Lanessan praised  this philanthropic effort, “embodying the work of concord and fusion,” the assimi- lative genre of colonialism for which Saigon was well known.15 The local press also  celebrated the Saigon oeuvre for demonstrating that the French presence in Asia  was flexible and absorptive in contrast to a British equivalent that was aloof and  austere, a “foreign body in the organism . . . threatened from one day to the next  with expulsion.”16 Evidently, similar concerns were emerging in Hanoi around the  same time, for the head of the Post Office, a member of the Public Works Depart- ment and a pharmacist together created a society there in 1897 with related aims.17
 Liberal reflections upon mixed-race people as worthy beneficiaries of state  support in the colonies derived not only from an inclusive notion of British impe- rial subjecthood based upon blood, but of the Eurasian as a child. Colonial visions  of ‘rootless’ and ‘culturally lost’ children connected with dystopic metropolitan  ideas of childhood split along the lines of a racialised class difference. But by  the 1880s impressions of street children in the metropole had shifted away from  midcentury assumptions of irretrievable racial alterity. As a wave of Christian  voluntary institutions led a drive for social purity in the face of growing secular- isation, every child came to be seen as potentially salvageable, capable of being  rescued to ‘true childhood.’ Re-exported to empire, such contentions obviously  threatened the practical consideration of running colonies such as Hong Kong on  a shoestring (the Colonial Office expected Crown Colonies to be self-sufficient).  So in response to Smale’s intervention, Governor John Pope Hennessy summoned  expert opinion. On his behalf, the German missionary from the London Mis- sionary Society, Ernst J. Eitel, who was also inspector of schools, explained that  for decades Eurasians had taken full advantage of the educational infrastructure.  Many boys had studied English within the colony’s schools. He noted that the boys are invariably sent to the Government Central school where they generally distin- guish themselves, and as a rule these boys obtain good situations in Hongkong, in the  open ports and abroad. The girls crowd into the schools kept by Missionary Societies.
 Indeed, the sense of reciprocity between Europeans and Eurasians in Singapore  spilled over into paternal gestures within the emerging voluntary sphere. French  and Spanish Catholics engaged heavily in social work among this group. As part  of an Anglican-oriented response, C. B. Buckley’s philanthropic ‘Christmas Treat’  celebrated and succoured the Christian children of poorer Eurasian families, in  particular those attending the colony’s schools and those with links to St. An- drew’s Cathedral.47 Consequently, if there was a ‘Singapore childhood’ on display  in the Treat from the late 1860s onward, Eurasian children were in large part its  public embodiment—though this group was never explicitly separated out and  defined as such, but instead fit within an overarching, plural vision of childhood.
 However, while racial intermediacy appears to have been less heavily proscribed  in Singapore for longer, around the turn of the century a variety of state-imposed  reforms imperilled the privileges that Eurasians had carved out in colonial soci- ety. When young Eurasians attempted a patriotic gesture by forming a Volunteer  Corps in August 1897, C. P. Lucas at the Colonial Office revealed that the colonial  secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, “strongly expressed” the view that such a develop- ment was “undesirable.”48 In 1904, Governor Sir John Anderson formally barred  ‘non-Europeans’ from senior appointments in the Straits administration.49 In  1910 another ruling barred Asians and Eurasians from administrative posts in the civil service, forcing them into inferior grades (as mechanics, typists, clerks  and train drivers).
 Whilst in Hong Kong exclusionary practices had prompted the odd letter  to the editor, in Singapore completely new journals or newspapers emerged to  serve as mouthpieces through which Eurasians could respond to this provoca- tion. Though these were often short lived, as in the case of the Singapore Eurasian  Advocate (1888–91), they sought to define and promote a discrete community and  its demands. After 1904 Eurasian interest groups also began to cohere around  public meetings held to protest the colour bar. One produced a petition that was  despatched to the British Parliament.50 Churches also provided an institutional  focus around which such energies found expression. Wealthy, elite Eurasians (of  the so-called double ten) had established early links with philanthropic culture as  patrons, but also noteworthy in this climate was the emergence of a new ‘genera- tion’ of Eurasian youth making more assertive demands in defence of what they  defined as their ‘community’s’ interests.
 Caught in the midst of this bitter debate, métis protection societies had given up  radical assimilationist positions but now sought to emphasise the importance of  their work by recasting Eurasians as vulnerable children.
 In the crisis, the paradigm of ‘maturity’ proved valuable both in interpreting  policy to London and in developing new bases for collaborative relations with  the Chinese elite. John Carroll has argued that a long-standing, carefully culti- vated and profound social distance separated Hong Kong’s British and Chinese  elites.94 However, from 1911, as we have seen, spectacular celebrations of childhood  bridged this social divide. During the war these efforts proceeded in new formats,  such as bazaars. In peacetime, Governor Stubbs’s wife, who was president of the  Ministering Children’s League, refashioned it into an umbrella organisation en- compassing much other philanthropic work. Because of this, child-centric vol- untary work exemplified and distinguished a ‘mature’ civility, and the language  of age emerged as one that Eurasians could draw upon to articulate a sense of  shared Anglo-Chinese interests in times of unrest.
 As the Great Depression hit Hong Kong from 1929 and competition for clerical  positions intensified, younger Eurasians became more keenly aware of the lack  of any ‘community’ leadership capable of defending their interests. This was per- haps unsurprising given that so many of the wealthy Eurasian elite had aligned  themselves with Chineseness. The problems of the younger generation were quite  different. And some now felt the need to create new institutions capable of pro- tecting their distinctive needs and concerns. An important example was the phil- anthropic ‘Welfare League’ (or Tongren hui), which held its first general meeting  in July 1930. Though Sir Robert Ho Tung served as president, the real energy was  supplied by younger members such as the thirty-seven-year-old solicitor Lo Man  Kam and Charles Graham (Carl) Anderson, the league’s secretary, who was in his  early forties.103 In a speech announcing this initiative, Anderson, who had been  born in Hong Kong to Eurasian parents, defended the notion of a Eurasian ‘com- munity.’ He located its essence not in terms of race or civilisation but maturity,  good citizenship and a fusion of blood. As he put it: We feel we are a community. . . . It has been said of us that we can have no unity, and  since even the semi-civilised tribes of Africa have it, this, though palpably absurd, is a  challenge to be faced and an insult to be wiped out. . . . With the blood of Old China  mixed with that of Europe in us, we show the world that this fusion, to put it no higher,  is not detrimental to good citizenship.104
 In this appeal Anderson located maturity in blood that was figuratively ‘old.’ Ul- timately, it was the Anglo-Chinese phenotype that distinguished Eurasians from  others still arriving on the civilisational stage. However, Anderson located Eur- asians’ ‘maturity’ in the blood of ‘Old China’ rather than Europe. Even younger  Eurasians, then, seemed to hark back to an older China, one where cultural Con- fucianism afforded their fathers’ generation a less exposed position within the  overarching framework of ‘Chineseness.’ This was a rather nostalgic response, but one that is unsurprising given that it was forged in the face of conditions  of depression that were eroding privilege and hastening societal fragmentation  defined along more intensely nationalist lines.
 Because Singapore society was more obviously plural than that of Hong Kong,  in the early twentieth century official policy focused upon reinforcing divisions  between constituent groups in order to prevent unrest. Fitting all of those resi- dent within racial categories required remarkable contortions and elisions, as Joel  Kahn has shown.106 But as the colonial state undercut Eurasians’ privileges the  latter proved adept at combining strategically with other Anglophone groups to  ‘express the views of domiciled communities.’ The Malay Tribune, for example,  a newspaper started in 1914 with support from Lim Boon Keng and Eurasian  benefactors, appealed to the English-speaking of all races and provided a vehicle  for such views.107

 There is no doubt that the Levant Company unreservedly  accepted that it had some responsibility for the spiritual well-being  of its overseas communities. The Church of England did not  impose chaplains on the company’s overseas establishments and no  religious authority in England controlled or supervised the indi- viduals who served in that capacity. The obvious such authority  would have been the Bishop of London, under whose jurisdiction a  royal order of 1634 placed the English church at Delft, and by  implication English churches in other overseas settlements. No  evidence has been found that this was ever interpreted to apply to  the Levant chaplaincies. The company was not bound by its various  charters to supply its agents in the field with the services of the  church, and there is no indication that it took the initiative in  imposing clergymen on the factories.
 The Protestant EIC communities in India felt themselves  similarly threatened by the many converts of Portuguese  missionaries. In the early seventeenth century the EIC chaplain, Matthew Cardrow, found a Catholic mission of the Barefoot  Carmelites already established at Isfahan, in Persia. Pope Clement  VIII had dispatched them there in 1604, with a threefold brief to  find out about Persia, investigate the possibility of political alliance  and make known the Christian faith. The Carmelites called the EIC  men ‘heretics’,44 but gave lodging to the factory’s Scottish Catholic  doctor45 when he fell out with the company. If the Church of  England chaplains of the Levant showed no real interest in  proselytizing, whether or not there were opportunities, it was partly  because they predated any concerted Protestant enthusiasm for it.  There were undoubtedly zealous individuals operating in the region.  In the late seventeenth century, for example, Dudley North wrote  about an Englishman, ‘John the Quaker, [as] a sort of pilgrim to  Constantinople, for converting the great Turk’.46
 That the company held to its religious principles and that  successive factory communities continued to want the services of a  chaplain, perhaps conceals a subtle change of attitude towards the  Church during the eighteenth century. Greater confidence and  increasing materialism had reduced God-fearing dependence on the  Church to what Spear, in his work on the British in eighteenth- century India, calls ‘true piety without enthusiasm’. Respectability was highly important in eighteenth-century British society and  (Spear continues) a clergyman representing ‘the most genteel of the  professions’ had become ‘the indispensable adjunct of any gather- ing of gentlemen’.48 It would seem probable that this applied  equally in the educated and privileged factory communities of the  Levant Company. Even if religious fervour was becoming less  fashionable, the chaplains were still necessary for the comforting  normality of their presence and the traditional services they pro- vided to their flocks. While the social life of the more remote and  closer-knit community at Aleppo revolved around the English  chapel (which was never more than a room set aside in the consul’s  house within the Great Khan), there is little to suggest that at  Istanbul and Izmir the communities had such a focal point. In  neither place were they billeted together as in the Great Khan at  Aleppo, so individuals had more personal freedom. The  seventeenth century habit of starting the working day with morning  prayers may have grown lax in the changing spirit of the eighteenth  century, though it was apparently still in place at Aleppo as late as  1778 when the factory chancellor was paid from Levant Company  funds for reading prayers during a gap between chaplains.49
 The East India Company, too, became less religiously zealous  and its traditional proactive concern for the spiritual and moral  welfare of its servants waned as the eighteenth century progressed.  Although its new charter of 1698 stipulated that every ship of ‘500  tons burthen’ should carry a chaplain, for the next 60 years the  increasingly mercenary directors were careful to ensure that the  ships did not exceed 499 tons. During this period too they not  always observed the rule that ‘every garrison and superior factory’  should have a chaplain.50 This was a far cry from the earlier strict  religious observance of the EIC factories, where attendance at  prayers had been compulsory and the sabbath was very strictly  observed. Britain’s growing supremacy and imperialist interest in  India allowed EIC chaplains to expand their activities in ways that were never at any stage available to their counterparts in the Levant  factories. They became heavily involved in the education of local  children, the care of orphans and other charity work, including  raising money for asylums and famine relief. They thus had a role in  paving the way for the Protestant mission societies that streamed  into India from the early nineteenth century.
 At the same time, in Iskenderun, Parsons tells us, there was a  Roman Catholic church with a burial ground under the charge of a  friar from Jerusalem. The English and Dutch (as Protestants who  preferred anything to Catholicism) were traditionally buried in the  graveyard of the large Greek church of St Nicholas – ‘a church  without steeple or bell’ but with a seminary that could accommo- date 12 students being educated for the priesthood. The students  wore black gowns and trencher caps, and were instructed by three  Greek priests, the most junior two of whom were very ignorant. He  adds that the Greek church had a good church plate, which it  always deposited with the English consul for security.54
 Sarah Searight comments that Levant chaplains often seemed to  share the view of most educated Englishmen of the period that  Muslims were beneath contempt and made no attempt to bridge  the gap between Islam and Christianity,61 but there is insufficient  evidence for us to judge just how common such an attitude may  have been. It is a fact, however, that these seventeenth and eigh- teenth century Church of England clergymen had no brief to foster  Christian–Muslim relations. Some of the bigotry and intolerance of  the early seventeenth century is perhaps reflected in the writings of  Charles Robson, one of the earliest of the Levant Company  chaplains, who served at Aleppo from 1625 to 1630. In a letter to a  fellow clergyman in England, he writes about an aqueduct bringing  water to the city ‘into curious cisterns, which are in the courts of  their Mos’kehs or churches, where either it is fetched for private  use, or forct to wash the stinking feet of the profane Turke before  they enter into their bawling devotions’.62
 CONCLUSION  The initiative that led to the presence of clergymen at the principal  English factories in the Levant for over two centuries came from  the communities themselves. In the more God-fearing early years  of the company this arose from genuine feelings of need for the  protection and support of a church in these distant outposts. There  was no shortage of Christian churches of Eastern denominations in  the Levant, and there had long been a strong Roman Catholic  presence in the region. However, England and the Levant  Company were firmly Protestant and the communities wanted their  own Church of England to be represented among them. By the  eighteenth century, a clergyman had also become a drawing-room  accessory in polite English society, a change in role that was  reflected in the small groups of essentially privileged and well- educated Britons who resided at the Levant factories. He was by  now required for the respectability he brought, as much as for the  performance of the usual functions relating to baptisms, marriages,  deaths and worship.
 Leiden, although a Protestant foundation, was open – uniquely  in seventeenth-century Europe – to students of all religions and  had attracted many dissenters from Britain.37 At this time, the  English universities were in the grip of the Church of England, and  admission was barred to dissenters. Under the 1707 Treaty of  Union, Scotland had retained its own separate established Church,  which was Presbyterian, and there was no such ban on attendance  at Scottish universities.38 Alexander Russell would thus have been  exposed to the influence of fellow students whose experiences  ranged from far beyond his native Edinburgh.
 CONCLUSION  The Levant Company’s apparent shortcoming in providing medical  care at its overseas factories must be seen in the context of the  times. The indications are that, even by the eighteenth century,  doctors did not enjoy any great repute, but fell into the category of  ‘worth a try’ when the need arose. Clergymen were regarded by the  less pious in much the same way, and there remained indeed a  certain blurring between the two professions and little specializ- ation in either. Divinity or medicine were the only subjects, besides  law, that universities had to offer, and, faced with such a limited  choice, it is reasonable to assume that for many, perhaps the  majority, vocation had little role to play in the direction their  education took.
 Chapter 6 investigates the British colony in Morocco in the context of a rather neglected theme in the history of Britain’s presence overseas. Power projection here is regarded through the lens of, chiefly Protestant, churches and cemeteries. Leaving aside the issue of proselytising, the consolidation of British communities in the Near East and North Africa, as elsewhere, inevitably led to the need for Protestant churches and for cemeteries. Their well-being and their survival were often seen to mirror the fortunes of the British community, in terms of its identity, self-image and prosperity. This was particularly true as, by the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, British political and commercial ascendancy in Morocco had begun to wane. Long-standing British expatriates, many of whom were intimately connected with Protestant worship in the towns and cities of Morocco, generally guarded their religious observance jealously. So too burial and memorialisation were important facets of identity, as well as of status. The shifting political backdrop in Morocco, with the establishment of the French Protectorate from 1912 – which demonstrated starkly what could be achieved in Morocco, and, in a sense, what the British Government had forfeited – and then the transition to independence in 1956, highlighted the increasing marginalisation of the British community.
 The fragmentary evidence concerning worship and memorialisation among Britons in Morocco is illustrative of many of the issues that arose in this regard. The protection of such sacred spaces became highly charged, not least as they often appeared to symbolise the security of the British community. This was true concerning notions of the preservation and sharing of British values as well as commercial fortunes. Often, the Church of England struggled to project its influence in such places. Ambiguous and also shifting diocesan control tended to exacerbate existing concerns within expatriate communities about their future. Missions and missionaries were often called upon to furnish chaplains but it was common for such appointments to be seasonal and there was a recurring sense of spiritual needs, as well as missionary work, being neglected.95 The discussions that occurred of the shortcomings of some of those men appointed to minister to expatriates, seemed to reinforce a sense of unease relative to the colony’s prospects. Encroachments, whether of the physical variety, for example from the reconfiguration of public space, from the authorities in the French Protectorate or from the Moroccan authorities, had to be resisted as unwelcome intrusions into the old Morocco, in which Britain had been the dominant power. The Foreign Office and its representatives in Morocco were sometimes found wanting concerning the support offered in this context. Typically, issues bearing upon sacred space were dealt with at consular level but, so closely interwoven were they with the fabric of Britain’s power projection, that it was not uncommon for their discussion to raise questions about national prestige and the prestige of the Church of England, as the Established Church.

 In fact, the Trotters had wider involvement in missionary activity. In retirement, Lt. Col Henry Trotter served on the council of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. His grandfather was William Otter, Bishop of Chichester, an outspoken defender of the British and Foreign Bible Society. His half-sister, Lilias Trotter, was a celebrated missionary in North Africa, and his brother, the Archdeacon Edward Bush Trotter, took a keen interest in Anglican missionary work.79
 During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Foreign Office, and its personnel, in London and overseas, was manifestly and understandably more preoccupied with living rather than with deceased Britons. Historians of British foreign policy have also, in general, eschewed the church and the churchyard and related issues bearing upon sacred space, although, of course, discussion of the role of missionaries and their interaction with the Foreign Office has begun to increase.1 This chapter examines aspects of the relatively neglected subject of Foreign Office involvement in British graves located in British, European and international cemeteries in Morocco. It also considers issues that arose concerning Protestant Churches there and touches, briefly, on matters raised by the presence, from the mid-1870s, of various Protestant missions which were active in Morocco from that time.2 The chapter does not explicitly discuss, in detail, issues bearing upon war dead and the relatively small number of British servicemen who died in Morocco, its airspace or in its waters during the Second World War.3 Rather, it presents a case study of the interface of administrative and international history in peace time, and of the use and control of sacred space, and, to a lesser extent, of public space, against a changing political backdrop.4
 These fore-mentioned cemeteries had considerable importance for expatriate Britons: their preservation was frequently regarded as an issue of personal, as well as national, prestige. The April 1904 Entente Cordiale between Britain and France did not eviscerate official British interest in Morocco, but it did wane in varying degrees thereafter. The expatriate British population, which was often referred to, not least by itself, as the British ‘colony’ and later ‘community’ struggled against this trend. It also resisted the threatened cancellation of various capitulations which, from their inception in 1856, until their abandonment in 1937, were seen to embody British rights and interests in Morocco. So too, in a sense, did the cemeteries, which, as the twentieth century progressed, were a constant reminder of the ‘old Morocco’, in which Britain had predominated in commercial and diplomatic terms. Their importance was accentuated by their location. In several cases, they stood next to places of worship, either in buildings which were readily identifiable as churches, such as St Andrew’s, Tangier, and St John the Evangelist, Casablanca, or buildings which had been consecrated for worship. Typically, these places of worship were overseen by committees, comprising leading expatriate Britons, which the local consul chaired. At Tangier, the church became closely intertwined with local expatriate politics and social hierarchies.12 These churches were central to expatriate life. As that existence came under threat, first from French political and commercial ascendancy, then from increasing levels of Moroccan administrative self-sufficiency, as well as from urban development, cemeteries attained increasing symbolic importance. However, as memories of old Morocco faded, and as the surviving British colony dwindled, and with it, funds to maintain the cemeteries, official support for their upkeep became more muted. In fact, for some time the attenuation of official support for expatriate Anglicans, had been apparent. From the mid-nineteenth century, if not before, financial constraints led the Bishop of London to derogate ministrations on the European Continent to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The latter body, as well as the Society for Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK), were also constrained by reductions in funding received from government.13
 Consular staff and diplomats, where present, were also at the heart of the British colony. They were pivotal to local efforts to maintain patriotism and British values. In Tangier and in other Moroccan towns and cities, consuls also played a key role concerning churches and cemeteries. They were, for example, closely involved in fund-raising efforts and in discussions about the maintenance and upkeep of churches.14 They acted as a conduit for enquiries about graves from relatives of the deceased.15 At Tangier and at Casablanca, consuls sanctioned or vetoed alterations to headstones, a function which reveals a good deal about the communities over which they presided. At the most basic level, consuls, as the enumerators of births, marriages and deaths within the British colony, recorded the key indication of its well-being. Often, they, and British diplomats, where present, led church services, played a leading part in church fund-raising and festivals, and made representations to the local authorities on church-related matters.16 They were also closely involved in efforts, in other areas of the colony’s life, to improve cohesion among its members, notably commerce.17 Soon after the establishment of the French Protectorate in 1912, this was one further area in which the British colony began to feel increasingly insecure. The striking development of French Morocco completely overshadowed correspon -ding developments involving Britons. Moreover, the construction of French Morocco and then of independent Morocco, often quite literally impinged upon these sacred spaces. At Casablanca, the Anglican Church of St John the Evangelist, built in 1906, and its cemetery, stood behind solid stone walls, and was rapidly surrounded and dwarfed by the new town, with the Place de France at its centre, and by a network of servicing roads, the expansion of which periodically threatened the cemetery’s continued existence. Thus, the church and cemetery, as with other British churches and cemeteries in Morocco, often appeared to echo the fate of the British colony.
 Mogador The Protestant cemetery at Mogador (Essaouira), where British merchants had sought to establish and expand their interests for some years, faced threats of a different kind.33 Consecrated in 1870, it served a small community of apparently largely transient Europeans and at some point, it was divided into Protestant and Catholic sections.34 Its upkeep and maintenance fell initially to European residents and then to the consular corps. Some of these residents attended Anglican services, which were led by the British consul or his nominee. Services were held in a building specially granted by the Sultan through the administrations of Sir John Hay Drummond-Hay, when minister to Morocco.35 Regular congregants expressed concerns about obtaining sufficient sums for the maintenance of the cemetery and church from expatriates, and bemoaned their neglect concerning pastoral provision. In July 1894, Robert Johnston, Vice-Consul at Mogador, wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, noting that since his arrival at Mogador in 1878, he remained ignorant if the Moroccan coast was under the authority of any bishop. He considered that occasional visits by clergymen in search of health or en route to other countries, was insufficient and he suggested that members of the Church at other Moroccan ports would agree with this view. Johnston’s concerns were possibly heightened by the death of two of his children in the previous five years.36 The Archbishop’s Chaplain, Colin Campbell, provided limited reassurance in July 1894, as did the Bishop of Sierra Leone, in whose see the city then stood, and who visited Mogador in 1902.37 But these gestures did not fully assuage the sense of neglect, something which was amplified by concerns about attendance at services. In July 1902, Archibald Madden, who in 1900 had suggested the addition of an evening service, proposed to close the church from the early summer to late autumn as he needed a day off from his combined consular and pastoral functions. During that period, many of the congregation were absent.38 Here, as on the European Continent, the issue of Britons who chose to live abroad was not a priority.39
 Concern for the cemetery was also reflected in discussions that had occurred in 1927 for the appointment of a permanent chaplain and a furnished parsonage. Previously, chaplains were generally temporary appointments funded by the British colony, aided by the Colonial and Continental Church Society.64 This practice was disruptive, and so, in the summer of 1927, the church committee appointed Gerald Selous to chair a sub-committee to investigate the feasibility of a more permanent arrangement. Selous explained the broader purposes of the sub-committee when writing to the Earl of Selborne in June 1927, in order to request his involvement as honorary president of its campaign: ‘A well-chosen married Chaplain is a great power for good in this small British community, spiritually, socially, and educationally, for it would be expected of him to inculcate the British outlook into the British children here….’65 Such an appointment could only strengthen British interests in Morocco at a time when the future of the capitulations was uncertain. Concerns about the Britishness of the colony, which had emerged before the First World War, and which continued during it, persisted. Elsewhere, Selous estimated the British colony at between six and seven hundred. Of these, however, only between one hundred and one hundred and fifty were Protestants.66 Furthermore, he calculated that there were merely thirty-eight English children, but a further eighty Gibraltarian and ninety-six Maltese children.67 As such, the chaplain’s role as educator was particularly important. As Selous explained to Lord Maclay, the shipping tycoon, and patron of the Southern Morocco Mission, when seeking his ‘moral and material support’ in July 1927, many English children attended French schools. Inevitably, they acquired a French outlook: it is evidently essential that British children should be convinced to the very core of their being that Britannia rules the waves and Wellington won the battle of Waterloo etc., etc. To be thoroughly British one must in childhood have absorbed the British doctrine.68
 When these discussions resumed in 1934, it was hoped that the Bible Churchmen’s Missionary Society (BCMS), whose mission had begun work in Morocco in 1931, would provide a permanent chaplain for St John’s. This duly occurred, with the appointment of Fred Morris, who remained in post until 1939. The appointment appeared to be relatively straightforward but the issue of his accommodation less so. As the society pointed out, if, as was being proposed, a parsonage or other accommodation were to be built in the church grounds, this would potentially afford the church control over the appointment.71 By the late 1930s, other issues had emerged, including payment of taxation on the guardian’s hut in the church grounds. Much more pressing was the state of the roof and a lack of funds to repair it.72 The Fall of France, concerns about the possible occupation of Morocco, and dwindling attendance at divine service, partly due to the departure of many Britons from Casablanca, made matters worse, temporarily, not least because of reduced subscriptions to church funds.73 The excitement provided by very large congregations of American soldiers, and various gifts bestowed by them, not least a beautiful oak pulpit from General George Patton, soon gave way to renewed concerns about the fabric of the church. As Cecil Green, who was officially Chaplain at St John’s since 1939, but an assistant there from 1934, noted in August 1948, discussions about the acquisition of church ground by BCMS in order to construct a house for the bishop, had revived discontent among the British community towards the mission and at a public meeting the British community had, with one abstention, unanimously voted against the cession of land.74 Rented accommodation in Casablanca was extremely scarce. This became apparent in the case of the Rev. Philip Meldrum, and his wife, who had come to Casablanca, ostensibly on a temporary basis, with a view to assuming the chaplaincy for the small British community at Rabat. Alfred Houghton, BCMS’s General-Secretary, wrote to the Consul-General at Casablanca, at Meldrum’s request, in order to reserve for purchase a prefabricated house in the Quartier Bourgogne.75 Thus, in various ways the importance of St John’s as a symbol of Britain’s presence persisted. At a time of street protests and unrest in mid-July 1955, Cecil Green noted with amusement that the Sunday service was attended by only six people: a motley, if interesting group. While the service proceeded, the Church Secretary abstained, preferring to seek Divine guidance by mowing the Church lawn.76
 It was perhaps a good thing that he did so. Threats, of one kind or another, to the church persisted. By way of example, in 1975, a petition from businessmen prevented the removal of the Church and cemetery to make way for a new road.77 The association of British consuls at Casablanca with the Church Council ensured that such matters did not escape official notice. So too did Cecil Green’s long tenure as chaplain. In early 1981, Paddy de Courcy-Ireland, the Consul-General, and chair of the Church Council, wrote to Green’s colleague at BCMS Headquarters, the Rev. John Ball, to express his concerns about Green’s health and his future and also that of two of his colleagues who ran a clinic at Amizmiz.78 This correspondence reflected a strong desire that Green’s successor should be a good fit with the British community but also with the political environment. For that reason, de Courcy-Ireland had expressed the view that Green’s successor should not have a missionary connection.79
 Occasionally, the church fringed with high politics. At a time of heightened international sensitivities, in July 1912, and when regular church attendance within the British colony was dwindling, the minister at Tangier, Sir Ernest Satow, had sought advice as to how to respond to requests for the use of the church from German and French Protestants. The possibility that, one year, the church might be loaned to a French pastor but refused to a German might cause problems.85
 When making his case in 1936, Ellis had accentuated the official con nection, arguing that Tangier was a diplomatic centre and was seen as such by other nation -alities. He further noted that the relationship between the Church of England and the English Crown was well-known and that the prestige of the Church of England as a whole would decline if the connection was severed and the church handed to a missionary body. Ellis explained that the British Crown held the church yard in perpetual lease and the church had been built by private sub -scription.103 Indeed, upon the chaplaincy’s incorporation into the new bishopric its amended rules were signed by Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary, as well as by Cosmo Lang and by Bishop Wright.
 When confronted with such developments, members of St Andrew’s displayed a degree of determination as well as resistance to change. A case in point was their lukewarm attitude towards efforts, from the mid-1970s, to encourage ecumenical activity among the various churches in Tangier. Mary Bull, who was the People’s Warden and Ecumenical Secretary, was personally extremely dedicated to this task but there is a strong sense that relatively few of the regular congregants at St Andrew’s had any real interest in becoming personally involved in these initiatives.117 Indeed, Bull herself bemoaned the fact that St Andrew’s had gone ‘too high’, a view which she felt was shared by many other members.118 In 1982, they also resisted the proposed removal of war graves from St Andrew’s cemetery by the War Graves Commission. Moreover, they offered to accommodate any military graves removed from Bubana.119 However, there was a sense that times were changing. By way of example, increasingly American Protestants in Tangier, including the American consul-general, were being considered for burial in St Andrew’s cemetery, and they had begun to play a greater role in its oversight.
 Rabat The marked sensitivities surrounding St Andrew’s and its British-by-birth congregants, was apparently in stark contrast to the small British diplomatic community at Rabat during the late 1960s. As there was no suitable place for worship for Anglicans in Rabat, its members occasionally used the Chapel of the Little Sisters of the Assumption and were also offered accommodation in the French Cathedral Presbytery or in the Franciscan Friary.121 When Herbert Ward, Honorary Chaplain at the British Embassy, contemplated his retirement, he suggested that one of the friars of the Society of Saint Francis might replace him. Conceivably, also, because the settled British presence at Rabat was very limited, no objection was made to the removal of the remains of two Britons from the old European cemetery, Place de la France, Rabat to Cimitière de Khébibat in Rabat.122
 On a more general note, the chapter is illustrative of a still neglected facet of Britain’s presence overseas during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: expatriate communities. At a macro level, in certain places and at certain times, there is evidence to suggest that the Foreign Office and its representatives on the spot regarded them largely as a nuisance or did not actively seek to establish further British enclaves without the settled empire. Much more research is needed to expose the extent and nature of connections between expatriates and officialdom as well as the extent to which, collectively the strength and well-being of expatriates might be regarded as an indicator of national strength and well-being. One of the few individuals to articulate the view that they ought to be so regarded was Henry Knight, Bishop of Gibraltar (1911–20). Writing during the First World War, he noted that expatriates were in effect representatives of their country, embodiments of the Christian life of the Anglican Communion as well as of the national character. Moreover, he perceived British colonies in his diocese as ‘avenues and channels of British trade’, where British capital and interests were involved. As such, he argued that their religious and temporal interests ought not to be neglected.142

Clarendon had also expressed the view that chaplains must be carefully selected. It was essential that they should not seek to disrupt established arrangements in terms of existing chaplaincies or to proselytise.

 Journalists, historians and social reformers argued in similar vein, proposing that empire federation should embrace America in a ‘Pan-Saxon Alliance’ of the English and American people. H. G. Wells would later call this a ‘great synthesis of the English-speaking peoples’, with its ‘head and centre’ in the ‘great urban region developing between Chicago and the Atlantic’.25
 Thatcher's public commitment to these ideas represented a notable shift in her own outlook and was prompted by her sharp turn against the EU. But there was continuity too in some of the sentiments she expressed, not least in terms of her own ongoing commitment to the Atlanticist ideal, which was still, in her mind, the core of the Anglosphere. Now blessed by Thatcher, this cause became of increasing interest to a new generation of Eurosceptic Conservative politicians and commentators, including David (later Lord) Howell, John Redwood, Daniel Hannan, David Davis, Norman Lamont, Liam Fox, Bill Cash, David Willetts and Michael Howard.
 During the long years of Labour rule in the UK, these governments provided a sympathetic international milieu around which the peripatetic ranks of think-tankers, MPs, intellectuals, media moguls and business donors associated with the Anglosphere could develop their networks, ideas and influence. The model for this kind of transnational Anglophone communion had been cast by Lionel Curtis in the first half of the twentieth century. Curtis worked variously as a government adviser, an Oxford don, a political pamphleteer and an author and was the prime mover in the Round Table movement and founder of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (popularly known as Chatham House). In the course of all this activity, he travelled regularly in the British dominions. Although few have matched his prolific output and influence, later Anglosphere enthusiasts were often following in his footsteps, though travelling towards a very different destination. As we saw in chapter 1, Curtis ended his career supporting union in Europe and a wider international Western federation. The architects of the twenty-first-century Anglosphere were developing arguments in favour of dismantling the European bloc and promoting a new, Atlanticist world order.
 For proponents of this outlook, including Trump, the EU's perceived inability to deal with the rising threat of political Islamic radicalism was the primary justification for Brexit. For Trump, this has made the UK an important point of reference, a conviction reinforced by some of his advisors' links with Nigel Farage and other British Eurosceptics. More generally, the political and corporate networks which the new president has assiduously cultivated are transatlantic in character and outlook and emanate from a longstanding set of networks and institutions which have often been committed to the ideals of the Anglosphere. These include such organisations as the Heritage Foundation, the Charles G. Koch Foundation, the Cato Institute and the (now disbanded) Atlantic Bridge.
 Gladstone’s “anxiety” marked the culmination of a decades-long movement that represented the Armenian cause as an imperial duty realized through British diplomacy. The vision found strongest expression in the person of Gladstone himself, described by one contemporary as a “humane man” with a “keen sense of the religious bearing of political questions.”11 Born in Liverpool in 1809 to a relatively prosperous, evangelical merchant family, his life and career spanned the nineteenth century. His father was a self-made man and sent the young Gladstone to Eton in 1821 and later to Christ Church at the University of Oxford. His education taught him self-reliance and helped him to forge important relationships with notable political and religious figures of the time. These experiences, according to his biographer, Colin Matthew, led to Gladstone’s belief that the purpose of liberal education was to reinforce orthodox Anglican Christianity.12
 His interest in orthodox religion during a period when Anglicanism was undergoing intense scrutiny from within led to a lifelong respect of the Eastern Orthodox Church as a unifying national and religious institution for Near Eastern peoples and would deeply influence his personal and political life.
 Religious, secular, and political advocacy organizations came to share this vision. They found inspiration in Gladstone’s advocacy on behalf of Ottoman Christian minorities who belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Church which he had embraced in his early years. Eastern orthodoxy, many believed, belonged to a religion sharing a common origin with Anglicanism.22 Anglicans and Nonconformists alike embraced the cause, raising money and performing relief work in the Ottoman Empire.23 Such activism cast humanitarian intervention as a simultaneously moral, religious and imperial duty that Gladstone, shown as a Christian crusader in Figure 1.1, maintained would “serve civilization” (Figure 1.1). In 1876, advocates founded the Eastern Question Association as an umbrella organization to advocate for Ottoman minorities that included Bulgarian, Armenian, Assyrian, and Greek Orthodox Christians.24
 Links with the Ottoman Empire in general, and Armenia in particular, were further strengthened by understandings of the region as the cradle of civilization and the birthplace of Christianity. Critics maintained that the end of the Crimean War offered a new opportunity for the West to reconnect with its ancient past in the East. “Since the 17th century there has been but little direct intercourse between the Orthodox East and the Protestant West,” observed one journalist, “but the great events of the last few years, which have opened for England such a career in the East, cannot fail to bring the subject very prominently before every one.” Anglicanism symbolically rejoined Eastern Orthodox Christianity in its birthplace in the Holy Land with the building of a memorial church at Constantinople to commemorate the war and unite Britain “with the members of the ancient churches of the East.” The British built this Anglican Church as a war memorial. It was “assigned a conspicuous site upon the hills which crown the Bosporus” and represented “a trophy of our heroism and our faith.”35
 A monument to Christianity and victory over its Russian rival, the church promised to unite Orthodox peoples with Anglicanism in the Holy Land. The memorial church still exists today.
 The Association continued into the early twentieth century much along these same lines as a “non-partisan and non-governmental” organization.

 The Status Quo  a n d the A dm i n istr ation  of the Holy Pl aces One of the urgent and sensitive challenges that faced the OETA administration  was the administration of the Holy Places in Jerusalem. Th e British policy toward  these sites was based on the Ottoman framework, which was introduced to Jeru- salem by the Ottoman authorities in 1852 (based on an even earlier position from  1757), referring mainly to the Holy Sepulchre and its legal status, and giving par- amount position to the Orthodox Church. Th e Ottomans originally introduced  the concept of “Th e Status Quo in the Holy Places” as an attempt to regulate the  right of control and access to the Christian holy sites in Jerusalem and Palestine.  Th e status quo was settled by a series of documents and decrees that were set by  the Ottoman Sultan Abdül Mecid in 1852, following the old dispute between the  Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and the Roman Catholic Church, which resulted  with the subsequent intervention of European powers in the Crimean War. Th e  decree, which was later confi rmed in the Congress of Berlin in 1878, established  the rights of several churches in relation to the Holy Places, including the ways  of public worship, decorations used in the shrines, and the ways of usage and  exercising ceremonies and rites.43
 A fourth type of business network that emerged in the context of eigh­ teenth­century German migration to British North America was based on  the transatlantic ties of Protestant clergymen. Thus the Lutheran pastors  whom the Halle institutions founded by the pietist August Hermann  Francke (1663–1727) sent to Pennsylvania and other colonies in order to  minister to the German Lutheran settlers there were not only concerned  with the state of immigrants’ souls but also took care of some of their  material concerns. They used their ties to church institutions in Europe to  forward letters, post search advertisements in newspapers and handle  inheritance cases.37 Above all, they imported books and pharmaceuticals  from the workshops of the Halle institutions in substantial quantities.
 refugees from all over Continental Europe who met in London. In these  circles discussion focused on the best way how to create an egalitarian  society. One method, proposed among others by Karl Marx and Friedrich  Engels, was active propaganda in Europe to cause a revolution which  would then, they believed, lead to the next stage of social development  and to communism. An alternative suggestion regarding the formation of  a communist society, however, referred to the creation of communitarian  settlements in the non-European world. Far away and undisturbed from  the influences of European capitalism, these settlements should be nuclei  from which the communitarian ideology would spread outwards and  from there over the rest of the world. Thus, so the defenders of the argu- ment claimed, communism could be realised in the present, which was  better than simply theorising about an ideal society in the future.
 The latter point of view was central to debates among socialists in  London in the 1840s. Protagonists of the idea of forming communitarian  colonies included the British socialist Robert Owen, who set up a number  of cooperative communities in Britain and the United States, the French  socialist Etienne Cabet, who launched the communitarian settlement  Icaria in the United States, and, on the German side, Wilhelm Weitling,  who was one of the most ardent fighters for communitarian colonies   in the non-European world. Weitling had developed an interest in com- munitarianism in Paris and Zurich. When he had to flee to London in  1844, he got in touch with Robert Owen and propagated his plan for over- seas communities among the German socialists in the Kommunistische  Arbeiterbildungsverein. There, a major debate about the topic took place  in 1845. Weitling’s opponents demanded that socialists should concen- trate their powers in Europe to fight for their goals. Distributing them- selves all over the world would weaken the socialists’ position in Europe.  Even though Weitling gained some support, he could not convince the  members of the Kommunistische Arbeiterbildungsverein to support his  projects. In 1846 he left London and one year later founded the colony  Kommunia in Iowa.12
 He was convinced that a European state that wanted to play an important  role in international politics should have overseas colonies. They not only  added to the international prestige of a nation, Bunsen believed, but were  also beneficial to the political and social situation at home. Being an emi- nent personality in the Protestant missionary networks of the first half of  the nineteenth century, he was, furthermore, involved in the foundation  of Protestant missionary communities in Africa. He hoped that they  would bring Western civilisation and Protestantism to the dark, heathen- ish regions of the world. As a diplomat in London, Bunsen aimed to estab- lish a German emigrants’ colony in California in the early 1840s. He was  supported by Prussian officials in London and the United States and by  the Hamburg merchant Karl Sieveking. Although he had advanced far in  his negotiations and the Foreign Office seemed to have tolerated his ambi- tions, the government in Berlin refused to support the project.15
 In the field of religion, Anglo-German co-operation was based on simi- lar preconditions. Around 1800, a wave of evangelicalism swept over  Britain, Continental Europe and North America. In order to spread the  gospel among the ‘heathen’, a large number of new missionary societies  were founded. The British clergy regarded the empire as entrusted to  them by God and felt it to be a moral obligation to make use of the oppor- tunities it provided for missionary work. Despite evangelical enthusiasm  for converting Africans and Indians to Protestantism, there were not  enough volunteers to cover the high demand for missionaries. Societies in  Basel and Berlin, on the other hand, had the candidates for missionary  work, but they lacked the overseas infrastructure and the financial means  to establish their students in the southern hemisphere. Thus it was agreed  to send out clergy from Basel and Berlin as members of the British mis- sionary societies, in particular of the Church Missionary Society and the  London Missionary Society. In the first half of the nineteenth century, a  high percentage of the missionaries in British missionary societies were  German-born.30
 German missionaries’ integration into British missionary societies fol- lowed a similar pattern. On the one hand, there were tensions and   conflicts regarding denominational discrepancies between Anglican rep- resentatives of the Church Missionary Society and the Reformed and  Lutheran Protestants of Basel and Berlin. German missionaries were   not prepared to make theological concessions to Anglicanism. On the  other hand, they became part of the process of British expansionism in  many ways. They were convinced of the superiority of Protestantism and  Western values and supported British missionary societies in propagating these in Africa and South Asia. For example, they assisted the Church  Missionary Society’s plans to develop the cotton industry of Western  Africa as a morally legitimate enterprise. They also adopted certain pat- terns of thinking of British missionaries and began to define their mis- sionary work in relation to secular aspects of expansion.36
 While many Germans settled in Britain, many others transferred them- selves directly to parts of the British Empire, or else went there after  spending time first in Britain. German scientific explorers, fascinated by  the findings brought back from British colonies, were attracted from the  late eighteenth century onwards to areas of the Empire. German mer- chants, as they were drawn to the British mainland, were also attracted  out to imperial destinations, and could be found alongside their British  mercantile brethren in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and elsewhere.  British commercial policy, and Britain’s domination of shipping, encour- aged German colonial entrepreneurs to remain close to the British impe- rial infrastructure. British missionary activity, meanwhile, was supported  by, and often drew on the active help of, German churches and groups.   A common Protestantism, and a particularly close relationship between  British Evangelical groups and German Protestantism, underpinned a  range of jointly supported projects abroad. While tensions existed  between German and British missionaries on the frontline of the empire,  German missionary activity, like its commercial counterpart, also never- theless depended to a great extent on the infrastructure of the British  Empire for its existence and operation.2
 Theodor von Bunsen, a prominent member of the Centralverein. Koerber  herself sent a newspaper article reporting the founding of the Centralverein  to Ottawa.57 Koerber’s plans for a transnational network of ladies’ societ- ies fitted well into the programme of the Centralverein. Even more so, her  acquaintance with Otto Hahn enhanced her credentials. In his 1866 and  1878 publications, Hahn had demonstrated that his thinking about emi- gration moved in the same direction as that of the Centralverein, espe- cially when he defended emigration as a way to establish lasting  commercial and cultural connections with overseas territories.58 With the  founding of a Württemberg branch of the Verein für Handelsgeographie,  Hahn quickly became the Centralverein’s most important source of infor- mation about Canada.59 Addressing audiences which were considerably  more conservative than himself, Hahn managed to craft an ingenious  argument for promotion of German emigration to Canada and against the  acquisition of German formal colonies.60 His arguments probably met  with some disapproval but he couched them in such nationalistic terms  that even the Deutsche Kolonialverein under the leadership of Prince  Hohenlohe-Langenburg took note of his cause.61 Throughout the 1880s,  Otto Hahn was Canada’s voice among Germany’s colonial advocates and  power elites.
 1914, the Prussian State Church in particular intensified its transnational  activities, strengthening the legal and organisational framework for an  increasing number of diaspora congregations to become attached. These  acted as an important vehicle to embed the nationalist rhetoric produced  within the Reich into emigrants’ notions of belonging and ethnic identity.  Their pastors had been ordained in Germany, representing a specific kind  of ‘Pastorennationalismus’. On the eve of the First World War, 27 German  protestant congregations existed in Britain: ten in the capital and another  17 in provincial cities, catering for a considerable percentage of the  migrant community.36 Pastor Münchmeyer, in a sermon before his con- gregation in Glasgow, describes the flood of patriotic enthusiasm on the birthday of our beloved Kaiser, which  had a particularly religious slant in our German congregations in Britain  […]. It was a telling testimony of the fact that the love towards the German  empire and its monarch constitutes an ever stronger point of unity for our  diversely composed congregations.37
 The overlapping of religious and secular spheres can be seen on a purely  personal level. In Britain, the pastors were board-members of the  Flottenvereine. In 1913, seven out of 12 board-members of the Glasgow  Flottenverein were also office bearers in the protestant congregation.41   A similar situation existed in Edinburgh, where Professor Julius Eggeling  was the chairman of the local navy club, as well as an office bearer in both  the protestant congregation in Edinburgh and the Association of German  Protestant Congregations in Great Britain and Ireland. Nation and Church  stood in a symbiotic relationship, just as in Germany.

In piecing the life of Churchil ’s headmaster together, I have drawn upon various unpublished primary sources, such as parish records of christenings, marriages, and burials; public records of birth, marriage and death; the English census, which has occurred every decade since 1841;10
 MacDonalds and members of allied clans were slaughtered by Presbyterian supporters of Cromwell; the MacDonalds being Catholic and Royalist (see Campbel , 1885).
 The latter custom was a means of ascertaining how religiously committed undergraduates had been if and when they later wanted to become fellows of their college, which ultimately required them to be ordained as deacons (Smyth, 1940, p.146).
 However, in the context of 1868, Sneyd-Kynnersley was espousing what might be called ‘radical conservatism.’ By 1868, there was vehement conflict within the Church of England. In the 1830s, John Henry Newman (1801-1890), an Anglican who later became a Catholic Cardinal, had led the Oxford Movement. The Oxford Movement, which began at the university, believed that Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and Protestantism were all ultimately branches of one Catholic Church and its members argued for a return to the ancient traditions of this Church, preserved in the practices of the Roman Catholic Church in particular. They were criticised as Romanising and secretive by evangelicals, in part because their movement was tremendously successful. Under their influence, Anglicanism became more like Roman Catholicism: The Eucharist became more central to worship and began to be taken more often, services became more ritualistic and symbolism- laden, vestments became more widespread, clergy began to dress distinctively, and Anglican monasteries and nunneries were established (Herring, 2010). There were various shades within this movement. The  Tractarians were the most extreme. Named after the Oxford Movement’s publications  Tracts of the Times,  they were general y highly sympathetic to Rome. The  Ritualists, with whom Tractarians crossed-over, were more concerned with issues such as the form of worship and the use of vestments.
 By the 1860s, Ritualist priests were fundamental y altering the nature of Church services, sometimes leading to violent disruptions from congregation members (Herringer, 2014, pp.13-14). The Tractarians evoked hatred among many evangelicals, in a society which was still strongly religious. Rugby headmaster Thomas Arnold wrote, in a letter to Queen Victoria, that, ‘I look upon a Roman Catholic as an enemy in his uniform; a look upon a Tractarian as an enemy disguised as a spy’ (Brown, 2002, p.540). For many Victorians, Catholicism was ‘foreign’ and associated with Britain’s enemies; embracing it was a kind of treason, and Tractarians were fifth columnists, a view often extended to Ritualists and even to the entire High Church (Mazurek, 2017, p.88). Evangelicalism became more ardent, partly in response to the rise of the Oxford Movement (Bebbington, 1989). This, in turn, led to most Ritualists stressing that they were reviving a distinctly Medieval English form of Christianity — they were ‘Anglo-Catholics’ — which fitted with the late Victorian Romanticising of Medieval England (Welby, 2016). A minority, however, simply imitated the Roman Catholic Church (Morris, 2016, pp.22-23).
 Taking communion while seated was a practice associated with the evangelical movement; the Low Church (Johnson, 1997), as was the infrequent taking of communion (Balmer, 2004, p.414). The evangelical movement became strongly influential in England during the nineteenth century. It was characterised by fervent religious belief in traditional doctrines, personal conversion, religious experience, conversion of non-evangelicals, puritanical attitudes, personal morality, and the rejection of perceived Catholic aspects of the Church such as pedantic ritual observance, clerical dress and church adornment (Bebbington, 1989). Britain’s main student evangelical movement — known as the Christian Union — was established at Cambridge University in 1877, six years after Oxford, Cambridge and Durham Universities were compelled to open their doors to non- Anglican students. The Christian Union had long been preceded by informal student evangelical meetings, which the authorities termed ‘enthusiasm’ (Barclay & Horn, 2002). Sneyd-Kynnersley’s petition can be understood as a pre-emptive strike — on behalf of the High Church — against the growing evangelical movement. The symbolism of this petition was important and we will see why in a later chapter.
 A Clerk in Holy Orders and Tory Activist The following year, Sneyd-Kynnersley was effectively outed as an extreme High Churchmen – a Tractarian - in the political magazine Truth.  A highly critical article published a list of every Anglican clergyman – over a hundred of them - known to be members of the Confraternity of the Holy Trinity; a ful y Tractarian society which had been established at Cambridge University in 1857

 Once socialism was accepted, then those who wished to leverage social status would virtue-signal, or try to showcase their intelligence and bravery, by questioning ever more aspects of the traditional society, leading to an arms race where more and more foundations of the ‘traditional’ society which had made Britain ‘rule the waves’ were undermined, a point which has been discussed more broadly by the German psychologist Volkmar Weiss (2007). As people became more comfortable, with religiousness predicted by stress (Norenzayan & Shariff, 2008), they became decreasingly religious and stopped caring about religiously-sanctioned views of how they should live their lives. At the same time, some members of the educated classes attempted to play for status by mocking and pulling apart the established religion. In 1963, the Bishop of Woolwich, John A.T. Robinson (1919-1983) published  Honest to God (Robinson, 1963) , in which he denied every key doctrine of the Church of England and effectively denied that God existed at al . And those who wished to leverage social status by virtue-signalling helped to create an arms race through which the welfare state became ever more lavish, meaning there was no reason at all to follow the traditional model of the family. This helped to undermine the traditional model of the family, which had existed for so long, because it meant that there was no longer any financial disincentive to have children outside of marriage. This arms race — this constant move to question everything, at least within just about acceptable boundaries — led to a constant drift away from everything which had held the country together before the War.
 We have already seen that there is fairly wide agreement among what are known as ‘social cycle’ theorists with regard to the indicators that civilization has reached its summer and is making its way into Autumn. Societies, in the Summer, are characterised by aristocratic rule and by a form of religiousness which binds the society together and is highly ritualistic in nature. This form of religiousness promotes positive and negative ethnocentrism; these qualities themselves being central to societies which triumph over other societies. As such, this society’s God (or gods) regards the society as somehow uniquely chosen, with all other societies less godly to varying degrees. Societal membership is, therefore, effectively a matter of bonds of ancestry, though people who refuse to abide by the society’s rules — which are divinely ordained — will be exiled or executed. This Cult is crucial to holding the society together, because it promotes cooperation as God’s will and exposes those who might defect.

 None of these colonies experienced indirect rule in the form it was intended.
 There is much corruption and staggering improvidence in ruling circles, but at least the elite aspires to include the hundreds of millions of the dispossessed in the open, secular, and free society whose benefits they enjoy.
 in the colonies was that of Anglican clergyman.39These changes may have done something to narrow the intellectual and social distance between them and Whitehall; they also tended to widen the gap between them and the non-official white community in their colony. Like Judges, Governors were moved around a good deal. The average length of a governorship in our period was less than five years, and one rarely lasted more than seven years. Governors thus had a commitment to the Empire as a whole much more than to the particular colony they were administering. Like Judges, Governors (and Colonial Secretaries, who often were promoted to gov- ernorships) tended to enforce a common pattern of rule based on instructions received from Whitehall.40 Further, as not only men of Government but professional gentlemen, they often held low opinions of the scantily educated commercial men seeking to make their fortune in the colonies by farming or by trade.
 Besides settlers and traders, there was a small number of clergy and missionaries in Fiji, chiefly Methodist, filling no simple single role and holding no single view. On the whole, those involved in spreading Christianity and in ministering to native Fijians were very critical of settlers’ treatment of them; but other clergy, attached to settlements, tended to share the enthusiasm of their congregants for further white settlement and economic development. The editor of the Fiji Times was himself a Methodist lay preacher. As the example of Sir William McArthur demonstrates, it was not hard to see in the South Seas “commerce and Christianity” advancing hand in hand.
 The Whitehall indulgence shown to Gordon was underpinned by his high social and political position, unusual for a colonial Governor.

 Representing the colony on various diplomatic missions seems to have given him an interest in colonial government in a warmer clime.
 But the nexus between the colonial state and the orthodox patriarchy, and even the liberal reformers, need not be traced to the dubious politics of non-interference, or simply to the “colluding patriarchies” that sought to limit the rights of women in India and Britain;89 the roots for a common ground may be found in colonial  knowledge, a reliance on scientific expertise erected upon an inflated presence of racial anxieties.

 . . . . When this [ a disaggregation of what has been termed the 'business'  lobby] is done, the contrast commonly drawn between officialdom and  business loses much of its validity because it is apparent that an important  segment of the non-industrial business elite consisted of gentlemen who  moved in the same circles and shared the same values with those who had  their hands on the levers of power - and often managed their investments  too. Imperial and imperialist policies did not issue from a conspiracy by a  covert minority but from the open exercise of authority by a respected elite  who enjoyed the deference of those they governed. Like-mindedness was  certainly extended abroad, but it began at home.
 Those observations are certainly correct, but they do 1_10t explain why,  given the answer provided by the economic calculus, the 'respected elite'  continued to enjoy 'the deference of those they governed'. Obviously, the  established policy of recruiting the bureaucracy from the public schools and  from Oxbridge meant that the men with 'their hands on the levers of power'  did share the views of the 'gentlemen capitalists'. Moreover, it is clear that the  House of Commons was 'a quintessentially patrician legislative body dominated  by the elite classes, business, and the professions. The members had attended  ancient universities and the major public schools and they were "club men"  with a vengeance'. 35 But none of these factors was immutable. In a democracy,  rules can be changed and politicians defeated; and even in California, lobbyists  have discovered that, in the face of widespread public concern, their efforts  are not always successful.
 More generally, these firms were not particularly successful lobbyists,  either collectively or individually, and Lord Inchcape is a peculiar case. Their  primary ideological attachment seems to have been to the principle of extreme  business autonomy, and they often deliberately eschewed opportunities to draw  closer to the state for fear of permanently eroding that autonomy .11 Inchcape's  sub rosa links with officialdom were, if anything, viewed with distaste by  other expatriate businessmen. One, Henry Gladstone, son of the prime minister  and head of the firm Gillanders, Arbuthnot & Co., denounced Inchcape's  activities in the harshest terms. 12
 imperialism, since my great great grandfather arrived in New Zealand in the 1860s, becoming the Wrst of a family succession of West Coast gold and coal miners. But this same family history also included a narrative of political and communist radicalism that was in contrast to the reverence of my mother for that last great British imperialist, Winston Churchill. If family history has not made me particularly susceptible to an uncritical acceptance of British imperialism, then neither has it had much to do with my appropriation of the other subject of this work, namely Anglicanism. Aside from my mother, Christian, and more speciWcally Anglican, inXuences in my upbringing were notional. My father was a gentle atheist who was surprised, but not opposed, when his son began to train for the Anglican priesthood, and I have now been a priest for thirty years. However, readers of my two previous books on Scottish Episcopalianism (Anglicanism), as well as this one, will not, I trust, Wnd that that commitment has in any way prevented me from being critical (some have said, hostile) to that church when it is warranted by my study of the sources.

 History of the British Empire, dealing with its origins.4 Notwithstand- ing this observation, Armitage believes that no particular pan- Protestant theory or support for empire emerged in either England or Scotland during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries because of the fractured nature of British Protestantism between the episco- palian Church of England and the presbyterian Church of Scotland.
 Consequently, religious conceptions of empire played little part in imperial identity and justiWcation until the eighteenth century.5
 While there were internal divisive obstacles in the way of develop- ing a British pan-Protestant ideology of empire in the early modern period, there were some individuals and groups among English and Anglican Protestants who did draw a connection between Protest- antism and colonialism. Dissenters and Puritans saw North America as either a religious Utopia for voluntary settlers, or as an asylum for religious exiles.7 Both conformist and Puritan Anglicans also saw the 4 David Armitage, The Ideological Origins of the British Empire (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 63 n. 8. 5 Ibid., 63–7, 99. 6 Louis B.

 Sermons by Church of England clergy in support of the beleaguered Virginia Company were one of the few signs of Anglican interest in missionary work in the seventeenth century. They were perhaps encouraged to do so because they did not have to practise personally the emigration that they preached to others. Called upon by the company’s backers to stimulate interest in its struggling colony, these preachers constantly drew attention to the poor comparison that England’s religion in the New World made with the more vigorous Spanish Catholicism spreading its erroneous version of Christianity there. They also viewed mission as a potential national undertaking, as in the Wrst such sermon in 1609 by Robert Johnson.
 However, these sermons had little eVect in promoting trans-Atlantic settlement, as missions were not a major stimulus for English colon- ization in the seventeenth century,10 even though the promoters of the scheme of settlement in Virginia did advertise their colony as a means of spreading Protestantism and wealth.11 ‘The principal andmain ends 8 Ibid., 9–12. 9 Andrews, Trade, Plunder and Settlement, 319. 10 Ibid., 32. 11 Canny, ‘The Origins of Empire’, 10.
 Even the English government made some connection between colo- nialism and theChurchof England in the seventeenth century. Colonial governors early in the reign of James I were required to promote the established religion of England in the areas under their jurisdiction.
 They were to ensure that ‘the true word, and service of God and Christian faith be preached, planted, and used . . . according to the doctrine, rights, and religion now professed and established within our realme of England’.15 This resulted in about a dozen churches being built in Virginia by 1634 and another Wfty by 1668, though in other North American colonies state-sponsored Anglicanism made little headway against established Congregationalism or other forms of predominant non-Anglican Protestantism.16
 Britain’s global expansion.’21 She has shown how imperialism was connected to the nationalism of the eighteenth-century English. I will endeavour to demonstrate that it was also associated with their religion, at least in the outlook of their Anglican leaders as they preached up the empire from the eighteenth century. Thus, I will argue, an oYcial and conscious Anglican concern for empire, and for missions by the Church of England, dates continuously from the foundation of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) in 1701. The annual sermons, and the published extracts of its missionaries’ reports at its annual general meetings (which were continuous from 1701 until the 1840s) allow investiga- tion into the formation, maintenance, and adaptation of an Anglican discourse of the British Empire from the beginning of the eighteenth century to the mid-nineteenth.
 The public views analysed in this work were not necessarily those espoused by the whole Anglican Church, either in its colonial or its metropolitan form. Bernard Porter has recently questioned whether there was any large scale imperial concern domestically in Britain,22
 and it is true that interest in the empire and its religious imperatives and implications was probably conWned to a minority of Anglicans, especially in the eighteenth century, the majority being preoccupied withmatters at home. However, whenmeasured by the membership of the SPG alone, Anglican imperial-mindedness, in terms of missions, represented a signiWcant minority that grew in size throughout this period. The Annual Sermon and Report were circulated only to mem- bers of the SPG for most of this period, but these included all of its colonial clergy and missionaries, as well as its few hundred members.23
 The following century the Church Missionary Society (CMS), under its secretary Josiah Pratt, was more alert to the potential of publicity in generating support, and accordingly he founded the Missionary Register in 1813 to be just such a vehicle for its membership and for the wider Evangelical Dissenting audience beyond that. It must also be 21 Kathleen Wilson, The Sense of the People: Politics, Culture and Imperialism in England, 1715–1785 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 24. 22 Bernard Porter, The Absent-minded Imperialists: What the British Really Thought about Empire (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), ch. 1. 23 H.P. Thompson, Into All Lands: The History of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, 1701–1950 (London: SPCK, 1951), 109.
 remembered that the Church of England was a multi-faceted organ- ization, so it was unlikely that any Anglican, nomatter how important, could express the mind of the entire church at any one time or over any one matter. Therefore, to reXect this diversity, I will focus initially, in the eighteenth century, on Anglicans connected to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, who were those in that church who did have an explicit concern for empire and Anglican missions within it.
 However, as this concern for empire, and for mission in the empire, widened among Anglicans in the late eighteenth century, other Angli- can voices will be heard from that period onwards, including Evangel- ical ones. The primary sources used for the investigation of these Evangelical and non-Evangelical Anglican public views of the British Empire are at the heart of the institutional engagement with the English–British Empire (the term is used to encompass the empire both before and after the union of parliaments in 1707, and to suggest the necessarily English bias of Anglicans), via the principal Anglican mission societies of this period, the SPG and the Evangelical CMS.
 This work is, rather, a history of the public views of bothmetropolitan leaders of the Church of England in England, and of Anglicans in these British colonies, regarding the church and the empire, and about the colonizing and colonized populations to be found there.
 All the Anglicans selected for investigation in this work are those whose views were suYciently signiWcant to warrant publication, and therefore, through publication, form part of a public discourse by Anglicans on the British Empire during the eighteenth century and the Wrst half of the nineteenth. By and large, these men were mostly those in positions of leadership within the metropolitan Church of England or its emerging colonial oVshoots, or they were Anglican missionaries in the various colonies under investigation here, namely North America, Bengal, Australia, and New Zealand. These four colonial contexts have been selected in this examination because North America was the earliest sphere of missionary Anglicanism; India witnessed a revival of the church–state partnership in the period following the loss of the thirteen colonies in North America; and Australia and New Zealand were the Wrst British colonies to implement a new paradigm of imperial Anglicanism that had developed in England during the 1840s.
 Finally, the book is also concerned with the engagement of Anglicans institutionally, as a church, with the empire, and therefore focuses attention on the changing nature of the Church of England’s partnership with the state, and also on ecclesiology—that is, its own self-understanding as a community of faith. The Anglicans investigated here did not stand alone, but were self-consciously and institutionally part of an older collective institution, the Church of England. They upheld an identity that was consciously ecclesias- tical, and saw themselves, ecclesiologically, as part of an on-going community of faith and belief that had a history and tradition that, although their particular theological dispositions interpreted it diversely, was something they received and consciously applied to their present context. So these Anglicans were, in this period, conW- dent of their church’s traditional beliefs and culture and, conse- quently, desired to export it to the British colonies for reasons to be explored here. In other words, it is impossible to investigate ‘Anglicanism’ and empire without also paying attention to the institutional Church of England, because the church provided the indispensable context for the beliefs of the Anglicans here scrutinized.
 Anglicans and Empire: Historical Interpretations The connection between English religion and the English (and later, British) Empire has largely been explained as the history of the export, from the 1790s onwards, of British Christianity to the British colonies following the so-called Protestant missionary movement, itself consequent in turn upon the Evangelical Revival of the mid- eighteenth century. However, this is to begin the connection between Anglicanism, missions, and empire a century too late. In 1701 a royal charter inaugurated a new society for the maintenance and spread of the Church of England in ‘foreign parts’, that is, in those new territories acquired by England as overseas colonies. From 1702 the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) established a tradition of providing annual sermons preached on the anniversary of the society’s foundation. These were printed and distributed, along with the society’s annual reports, which increas- ingly contained extracts and précis from reports of the society’s missionaries. In these two sources, one derived from the centre of empire, and the other from its colonies, the public theology of the SPG in England, as expressed by its oYcial preachers and mission- aries between 1701 and 1844, was the most sustained eVort by the Church of England in that period to wrestle with the religious implications of the new overseas empire acquired by the British from the early eighteenth century. These sermons and reports gave rise to the Wrst oYcial Anglican construction of English–British imperialism. It was also an Anglican discourse genuinely concerned— from the very Wrst decade of the Society’s existence—with evangelism and conversion of both indigenous peoples and white colonists. Conse- quently, this chapter will argue that the eighteenth century witnessed the commencement of a genuine Anglican missionary consciousness, which can be understood as part of a pan-European eighteenth-century Protestant revival of piety.
 In contrast to the attention paid to Evangelical missions,1 the mis- sion of the SPG has not received much scrutiny from historians. Apart from a recent history of the SPG, which is rather patchy in its critical assessment,2 modern historical assessment of the society has mostly been in passing, withinworks onwider themes. An exception is an essay by Boyd Schlenther in which he examines the society’s role in a reinvigorated Anglicanism in colonial North America. According to Schlenther, the society saw itself as a ‘handmaid to Empire’, combating the inXuence of Roman Catholic France and Spain in imperial terri- tories.3 This judgement that the SPG was a largely uncritical supporter of British imperialism from the eighteenth century onwards is the prevailing historical consensus among those historians who pay the society any attention at all. Jonathan Clark, for example, refers to it as a ‘bastion of British imperialism’ during the eighteenth century, whose support for an Anglican hegemony in North America exacer- bated Dissenters’ fears in those colonies of an Anglican establishment.4
 1 The literature is enormous and growing annually with the revitalization of interest among church historians, and historians more generally, in the history of Christian missions as sources for studies in the wide range of subjects concerned with colonial interaction. Mostly these works focus on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries rather than the eighteenth, due to the prevailing historiographical connec- tion made between Evangelicalism and the origins of British Protestant missions. In addition to works on Evangelical British missions cited throughout this chapter, some of the most recent monographs include C. Peter Williams, The Ideal of the Self- Governing Church: A Study in Victorian Missionary Strategy (Leiden: Brill, 1990); Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth-Century England (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1999); Kevin Ward and Brian Stanley (eds.), The Church Mission Society and World Christianity 1799–1999 (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2000); papers from the North Atlantic Missionary Project; Brian Stanley, The History of the Baptist Missionary Society 1792–1992 (Edinburgh: T & T Clark, 1992); A.F. Walls, The Missionary Movement in Christian History (Edinburgh: T & T Clark, 1996). 2 Daniel O’Connor and others (eds.), Three Centuries of Mission: The United Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, 1701–2000 (London: Continuum, 2000). 3 Ibid., 131. 4 J.C.D.

 It provoked the reaction of Dissent, domestically and in the colonies, against what was viewed as an Anglican desire for colonial supremacy.5
 Outside the chronological scope of this work, James Greenlee and Charles Johnson comment that an imperial theology persisted in the SPG longer than in most nineteenth-century British missionary soci- eties.6 However, aside from this view of the society as pro-imperialist, it has received little detailed examination.
 The SPG was founded to be a missionary society, and there are grounds for taking its missionary ethos in the eighteenth century— and therefore its inXuence in propagating an understanding of the British colonial world that provided the context for its missionary endeavours—more seriously than has hitherto been the case among historians. In a recent work on the origins of the eighteenth-century Protestant missionary movement, Andrew Walls has drawn attention to its European origins. Walls points out that this is in contrast to the usual British historiography, which regards William Carey’s book, Enquiry into theObligations of Christians toUseMeans for the Conversion of the Heathens (1792) as initiating British Protestantmissions, which in turn led to the development of missions on the Continent and overseas.
 In contrast, Walls pushes the origins of Protestant missions back to the Wrst half of the eighteenth century in the German Pietist and Moravian initiatives of Halle and Herrnhut, associated with Auguste Francke and Count Zinzendorf. These continental Protestant move- ments led directly to the Danish mission at Tranquebar in 1706 and to missions in Labrador and in Greenland in 1722. The much later work of William Carey in 1792, according to Walls, therefore marks the beginning not of Protestant missions but rather of British participation in what was by then an already ‘well-established continental tradition’.7
 Walls is undoubtedly correct in setting the origins of Protestant mis- sions within early eighteenth-century European Pietistic revivalism.
 However, he unfortunately maintains a late eighteenth-century dating for the British participation in that Protestantmissionary awakening, by retaining an identiWcation of British missions with Evangelicalism that is all too common in the literature.8 Consequently, for Walls it was the Evangelical Revival that provided British Protestant missions for the Wrst timewith committed personnel and the voluntary societies to direct them. According to Walls’s interpretation, the British dimension of the European missionary movement still begins in the late eighteenth century as a consequence of the outworking of the Evangelical Revival because he retains William Carey as its initiator.9 But British overseas missions predated Carey and the Evangelical Revival, with the forma- tion of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) in 1698
 and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts in 1701.10 Walls’s revision of the customary dating for the origins of Protestant missionary consciousness and activity would be even more convincing if he had pointed to these missions, rather than the Evan- gelical societies of the 1790s, as marking the beginning of British participation in a European-wide Protestant missionary consciousness.
 The failure of historians to recognize that the origins of British Protestant missions lay not with the Evangelical missions at the end of the eighteenth century but with these two earlier Church of England societies can be attributed to two reasons. There is either the prevalent equation of British missions and Evangelicalism, or a dismissal of a missionary consciousness among the eighteenth-century churchmen 8 For example, Brian Stanley in The Bible and the Flag: Protestant Missions and British Imperialism in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries (Leicester: Apollos, 1990), 55–6, is content to accept the customary dating of the missionary awakening in Britain as originating with the Evangelicals and William Carey in the 1790s. The premier historian of British Evangelicalism, David Bebbington, also conWnes British overseas missions to the fruit of the Evangelical Revival in his Evangelicalism in Modern Britain: A History from the 1730s to the 1980s (London: Unwin Hyman, 1989), 12, 40–2.
 9 Walls, ‘The Eighteenth-century Protestant Missionary Awakening’, 24, 34. 10 It appears that the original name of the SPCK in 1698 was ‘the Honourable Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge’.

 who comprised the membership of these societies. For example, the same volume in which Walls’s essay is found is, according to its editor, concerned only with Protestantmissions, yet there is nomention of these non-Evangelical mission societies despite its inclusive title, Christian Missions and the Enlightenment. In fact, as the editor later admits, the essays are solely focused on the missions of Evangelical Protestantism, though these are very late comers into Enlightenment culture compared with the two older Anglican societies.11
 There is, among some recent historians, either a disparagement, or even a denial, of a missionary consciousness among the Anglican churchmen who preceded the Evangelicals; or a tendency to reduce the work of these two Anglican societies to that of the mere mainten- ance of established religion among colonists without any concern for the evangelization of indigenous peoples. Brian Stanley, for example, contrasts what he calls the ‘formal’ Christianity of eighteenth-century Anglicanism, with its emphasis on Christianity as part of national culture, with the religion of the later Evangelicals who emphasized individual faith, or what he questionably calls ‘real Christianity’, and which he sees as alone prompting missions and conversions.12 The same distinctions are made more recently by Catherine Hall in her history of the Baptist envisaging of empire, in which she describes the Evangelical Revival of the eighteenth century as witnessing ‘the re-emergence of vital, serious or real Christianity, as compared with the nominal focus which had come to dominate Christianity’.13
 A more explicit denial of the existence of any motivation for mission among the membership of the SPG and the SPCK is found in an essay by Penny Carson. Examining the evangelistic motivations behind the British missions to India she maintains that the Anglican bishops ‘were not distinguished by a passion for the dissemination of Christianity among the indigenous population of the colonial territories’. Further, she asserts that ‘most High Churchmen before 11 Brian Stanley, ‘Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation’ in his Christian Missions and the Enlightenment, 2, 4. 12 Ibid., 11, 14. 13 Catherine Hall, Civilising Subjects: Metropole and Colony in the English Imagin- ation, 1830–1867 (Oxford: Polity Press, and Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2002), 86.
 the Oxford Movement held aloof from missions’.14 John Walsh and Stephen Taylor also believe that the SPG showed very little interest in converting the native populations of North America in the British colonies there, devoting its resources instead to the support of the colonial settlers.15
 Elizabeth Elbourne may be right in claiming that it took a long time for Anglicanism to develop a popular missionary culture, but that did not mean that an awareness of mission imperatives was entirely absent among elite Anglican circles in the eighteenth century.16 What Carson terms a ‘missionary impulse’ did not originate with the formation of the Evangelical Church Missionary Society (CMS) in 1799, as she suggests.
 Instead, an authentic missionary culture towards the English–British Empire—albeit a minority one—with identiWable elements and prac- tical outcomes, was already present in Anglicanismwith the foundation of the SPCK and SPG nearly a century before William Carey or the inauguration of the CMS in 1799.
 In fact a genuine concern for mission, understood as evangelism of non-Christian or nominally Christian populations in the empire, among eighteenth-century High Churchmen has already been pointed to by a number of historians. In his insightful biography of the late eighteenth-century High Churchman Bishop Samuel Horsley (1733– 1806), F.C. Mather pointed out that early in his career Horsley became an active member of the SPG.17 As a member of the society’s Barbados committee he did oppose the Evangelical push for missionaries among the population of India, believing that the British had no divine man- date to overturn the religion of another country.18 But this did not prevent him supporting evangelism in crown colonies (such as among 14 Penny Carson, ‘The British Raj and the Awakening of the Evangelical Con- science: The Ambiguities of Religious Establishment and Toleration, 1698–1833’ in Stanley, Christian Missions and the Enlightenment, 48, 49. 15 John Walsh and Stephen Taylor, ‘The Church and Anglicanism in the ‘‘Long’’ Eighteenth Century’ in John Walsh, Colin Haydon, and Stephen Taylor (eds), The Church of England, c.1689–c.1833: From Toleration to Tractarianism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), 15. 16 Elizabeth Elbourne, ‘The Foundation of the Church Missionary Society: the Anglican Missionary Impulse’ in ibid., 249. 17 F.C. Mather, High Church Prophet: Bishop Samuel Horsley (1773–1806) and the Caroline Tradition in the Later Georgian Church (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), 14, 237. 18 Ibid., 244.
 the slaves of the West Indies) as opposed to India which was then still largely governed by Indian rulers. Nor was support for the missionary work of the SPG limited to bishops. Probably its leading protagonist at the end of the eighteenth century was the wealthy High Church banker, William Stevens. W.M. Jacob, in an examination of the lay piety of the eighteenth century, has demonstrated how the work of the SPG attracted wealthy laity who gave it substantial donations, seeing in its evangelistic work a dimension of the century’s emphasis on charity.
 Jacobs has also identiWed the SPG and the SPCK as precursors of the voluntary societies of later Evangelicalism.19
 However,much of thisHighChurch concern for evangelism is found in the late eighteenth century, and therefore could be said to derive not from its own theological tradition but from the inXuence of the contemporaneous Evangelical Revival. But, as will become evident in this work, the evangelistic concerns of these late eighteenth-century High Churchmen were expressed by earlier advocates of the SPG throughout that century. Proclaimed by a variety of its oYcial preachers, and practised intermittently in the North American colonies, this eight- eenth-century missionary concern indicates that some in the society had always sought the evangelization of non-Christians and slaves, in addition to the more prominent care for the faith of British colonists.
 Indeed, an imperial evangelism was embedded in the purposes of the society from the start. Craig Rose has demonstrated that for their founder, the Revd Thomas Bray, both the SPG and the SPCKwere to be exemplars of an ‘evangelical philanthropy that was designed to achieve domestic and foreign conversions through an exercise of benevolent charity’.20
 Neither was the SPG’s concern for evangelism of British overseas territories entirely aspirational. The society’s colonial clergy did evangelize among non-Christian populations in the British territor- ies, which were the only ones that legally fell to the SPG within the terms of its royal charter. Bray was conscious of the need for his society to convert the Native Americans, and this was undertaken to a larger extent than is often recognized. According to its most recent 19 W.M. Jacob, Lay People and Religion in the Early Eighteenth Century (Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996) 50, 158, 184. 20 Craig Rose, ‘The Origins and Ideals of the SPCK, 1699–1716’ in Haydon and Taylor, The Church of England, c.1689–c.1833, 179–80.
 historian, by the end of the eighteenth century the society’s missionaries were involved with forty-six Native American tribes. They were most successful with the Mohawks, who became predominantly Anglican.
 So therewas a genuine evangelizingmissionary culture of engagement with the English–British Empire within the SPG, which was publicly proclaimed in England, though it was a minority one in the colonies themselves. This work attempts to examine that public discourse, and to delineate the characteristics of that non-Evangelical missionary and imperial culture of eighteenth-century and early nineteenth-century Anglicanism formed in England and in the colonial contexts. One major source for this exploration is the anniversary sermons that annu- ally celebrated the society’s foundation. These sermons were a major occasion in the public life of the Church of England. They were preached before members of the society every year on 15 February to commence the annual meeting of the SPG, usually in the parish church of St Mary-le-Bow in London. These congregations included many 21 O’Connor, Three Centuries of Mission, 32–4. 22 Ibid., 34–7.
 These sermons were then published alongwith the annual reports of the Society, which contained portions or summaries of reports from its missionaries in the colonies. These publications were distributed throughout England and in the colonies, and thereby constituted the promulgation of the oldest continuous Anglican discussion of the empire among Anglicans at home and abroad.
 Notwithstanding the SPG’s forging of this connection between empire and Anglicanism, a number of historians of the early English and then British Empire have dismissed religion as a major causative factor in the emergence of imperialism. Kenneth Andrews, in his history of the early empire, came to the conclusion that overseas territorial acquisition by the English took so long to occur in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries because colonization and mis- sions were very much secondary to trade and piracy, which brought quicker returns for less eVort. The contribution of religion in this period was not to missions or to colonization but in the propagation of an anti-Spanish rhetoric that stimulated overseas adventuring by the English in terms of plunder.23 Jack Greene has questioned the alliance between religion and commerce in the construction of British identity made by Linda Colley. He believes that the predominant opinion among Britons at home and in the colonies was that liberty was basic and this, rather than Protestantism, boosted commerce, and not the other way around, as Colley maintains. Britons pointed to their history of intellectual and political independence as a funda- mental cause of their break from Rome and their development of a commercial empire.24 This reduction of a religious dimension to English–British imperial expansion has been underlined recently in the work of David Armitage, who maintains that there is nothing particularly Protestant in the origins of British imperial ideology.
 A Protestant ideology for the origins of the empire did eventuate, but this, according to Armitage, was only with the work of Bishop White Kennett in his Bibliothecae Americanae Primordie of 1713.25 It is Kennett who begins the construction of an empire that is commonly understood to be Protestant, commercial, maritime, and free.26 But Kennett wrote this work—a printed catalogue of some 300 books he and his friends had assembled on American topics—to form the basis of an American library for the SPG.27 It was the context of the society, and Kennett’s very early and active membership of it, that provided the already existing environment for the development of his and other Anglicans’ concerns for the North American empire. More particularly with regard to the Church of England, Armitage believes it ‘never became a uniWed, imperial Church, least of all in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries’, because it was eVectively just one of a number of ecclesiastical bodies in the English–British state.28
 Armitage’s view of the Church of England rather downplays its inXuential established status in the most populous and powerful national component of the British state.
 The Enlightenment examination of the natural world was a worship of that world’s creator. The Church of England was intimately involved in this scientiWc and geographical quest because it believed that it was a counterbalance to Protestant ‘enthusiasm’ and Catholic superstition alike.29 While Drayton puts Anglicanism centre-stage in the British Enlightenment discovery of the overseas world, Jonathan Clark and Linda Colley have brought religion to the forefront in the domestic history of eighteenth-century Britain.
 Jonathan Clark, in the second edition of his seminal English Society, has postulated that during the long eighteenth century England was a dynamic and successful ancien regime founded on monarchy, aristo- cratic and hierarchical social order, and religion, predominantly in the form of the established Church of England. Anglicanism retained its prominence in this society through a hegemonic dominance, rather than any eVective monopoly of religious control.30 With regard to the empire, a domestically inXuential Anglicanism, therefore, formed one of the ties that bound together the transatlantic empire. However, when the Church of England attempted to export its English hegemony to the North American colonies it became a major factor in precipitating the American War of Independence. The Anglican expansionist push of the eighteenth century, chieXy by the SPG but also by some colonial Anglicans, enabled powerful Dissenting congregations in the American colonies to portray Anglicanism as militant, expansionist, intolerant, and persecuting.31 For Clark, religion consequently plays a major part in the history of the eighteenth-century British Empire.
 Linda Colley is the other scholar to place religion, or more spe- ciWcally Protestantism, and imperialism in a central position in eighteenth-century Britain. For Colley, Protestantism was one of the major factors contributing to an emerging British identity in the eighteenth century, along with war, patriotism, and a commercial empire. A common Protestantism united the formerly disparate and independent parts of Britain following the Act of Union between England and Scotland in 1707, Wnding expression in recurrent wars against Catholic France for imperial mastery, prompting the popular growth of a Protestant patriotism that maintained that Britain was particularly blessed by God. Colley has been criticized, not least by Clark, for overlooking the divisions within British Protestantism, but, as Tony Claydon and Ian McBride have recently concluded in their work on Protestantism and national identity, while Clark and Colley may have overdrawn the power of the Church of England or of a uniWed British Protestantism, it now seems undeniable that 30 J.C.D. Clark, English Society 1660–1832: Religion, Ideology and Politics during the Ancien Regime, 2nd edn. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), ch. 3. 31 J.C.D.

 there was a close link between religion and national identity.32 This national identity had an imperial dimension in the eighteenth cen- tury due both to wars with Catholic France for overseas territories and to the transatlantic connection of Britain with her North Ameri- can colonies. In the latter, Anglicanism played a role through the SPG missions.
 But if religion was an important ingredient in the development and understanding of national identity, was it also a case that Christian missions were involved in this connection also? To what extent were missions responsible not just for the export of British religion but, in the case of Anglican missions, for an English identity as well? There is a prima facie case that Anglican missions did have the eVect not just of making Christians in colonies but of supporting a sense of Englishness or Britishness there as well. The historian of colonial Anglicanism estimates that loyalists were a minority of Anglican clergy in Revolu- tionary America.33By that time a number of the clergywere native-born or non-English, and not directly missionaries of the SPG;34 most American lay members of the Church of England, Woolverton con- tends, were also not loyalists.35 But a more recent historical assessment estimates that among the Anglican clergy working in North America a majority of those employed by the SPG became loyalist exiles,36 an assessment that does not include the likelihood that there were additional SPG clergy with loyalist sympathies who nevertheless stayed in America. So society clergy were more likely to have a stronger sense of Englishness than their non-society Anglican counterparts. It is also interesting that the indigenous population among which the society had the greatest conversions, the Mohawks, was also the native group that fought for the British in the Revolutionary War and went into exile in British North America (later Canada) with their SPG clergy 32 Tony Claydon and Ian McBride, ‘The Trials of the Chosen Peoples: Recent Interpretations of Protestantism and National Identity in Britain and Ireland’, in Tony Claydon and Ian McBride (eds.), Protestantism and National Identity: Britain and Ireland, c.1650–c.1850 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 26. 33 Woolverton estimates that of 286 colonial clergy, 150 were patriots.

 afterwards.37Consequently, there does seem to be a connection between the SPG clergy and a sense of English or British identity that translated into loyalism in revolutionary North America.
 That same connection between Britishness and Anglican missions does seem to have been present later, in colonial New Zealand, though here also the evidence is uncertain, lacking more research.
 (Though they may also have been taking the opportunity to settle old scores with traditional enemies.) In addition, during these wars and subsequently, a number of indigenous prophetic movements Xourished among the Maori, whose leaders identiWed a need for the preservation of a Maori spiritual identity over against the missionaries’ Christianity, which they believed was too allied to European culture and colonial dominance.40 Therefore, again there is some evidence that points to Anglican missions promulgating a sense of British identity among their evangelized subjects. However, this did not always result in a pro-British outcome, for it could also lead to criticism of British colonial policy, as when, in 1860, Bishop Selwyn and the missionaries criticized the government’s land grab in the Waitara region as being contrary to British law.41
 An indication that this more colonially contextualized, critical interpretation was beginning to inXuence missionary historiography, Norman Etherington maintains, came when Stephen Neill in his Colonialism and Christian Missions (1966) took seriously the anti- missionary approach of Robert Rotberg’s Christian Missions and the Creation of Northern Rhodesia, 1880–1924 (1965).44 However, this judgement needs qualifying. While criticizing missions, Neill also wanted to defend the missionaries, claiming that they were often the only supporters that oppressed indigenous peoples had, even if 42 R.C. Delavignette, Christianity and Colonialism (New York: Hawthorn Books, 1964), 50–71. 43 E.A. Ayandele, The Missionary Impact on Modern Nigeria, 1842–1914: A Political and Social Analysis (London: Longman, 1966), 331. 44 Norman Etherington, ‘Missions and Empire’ in Robin W. Winks (ed.), The Oxford History of the British Empire, vol. 5: Historiography (Oxford, 1999), 307.
 While they were often at work beyond the boundaries of the colonial power, missionaries most often believed they were better judges of the common good than the local people. Consequently, this often resulted in missionaries supporting colonial rule as a means of protection for indigenous peoples, or desiring the prolongation of colonial control, with the result that, in general, missionaries were enthusiastic supporters of their country’s colonial expansion.
 Andrew Porter has also restated the connection between religion and imperialism in a 1993 article in which he drew attention to the ways in which this relationship changed over time during the nineteenth- century British Empire. At the beginning of the century Protestant missions preferred to keep the state at a distance—especially Noncon- formists, whose suspicion was fuelled by their domestic experience of the oppressive British state. This distancing between religion and empire was conWrmed by contemporary theology, which emphasized the availability of salvation to all and the responsibility of the converted, rather than the state, to spread the gospel. However, a much closer relationship developed during the nineteenth century, in which mis- sions and their supporters were prepared to use the state to overcome temporary barriers to the gospel, such as hostile locals and white settler governments, or to facilitate the security of missionaries in their localities. Yet, despite this closer connection with state imperi- alism,missionary self-suYciency remained an intermittent theme. This was partly a consequence of the growing denominational neutrality of the British state, but also because of emerging pre-Millennialist views of the total depravity of human corruption, and increasing govern- ment restrictions on missions. Consequently, by the early twentieth century the distance between missions and the imperial government had re-emerged. Nevertheless, Porter aYrmed that Britishmissions did demonstrate a support for empire that shaped ‘a nationalistic mis- sionary imperialism’, which, in qualiWed and critical ways, contributed to a spiritual and moral inspiration for British imperial expansion.52
 Porter does agree with the ComaroVs that the cultural contact between missions and local cultures was far from a one-way or one- sided aVair in which all power and inXuence lay with the evangelizing missions. The resources oVered by the missions, such as education and the Christian religion itself, were often appropriated by local peoples for ends that were not withinmissionary control. In addition, missions could have a liberating eVect on local peoples and conse- quently be welcomed—for example, by low-caste peoples in India as a means of defending their cultural, economic, and political interests.
 Notwithstanding Porter’s criticism of the concept of cultural imperialism with respect to Christian missions and their relation- ship to European imperialism, most commentators have generally accepted, to some degree, the validity of the charge. Two of the latest authors on the connection between religion and British imperialism, James Greenlee and Charles Johnston, Wnd that missions were mostly a mirror of widespread British rhetoric and expansionism in the decades between 1870 and 1918. Generally, the British Empire was regarded by its missionaries as a providential agent for evangelism or simply a neutral guarantor of missionary opportunity in a ‘spiritual free trade’ in British territories. This was the missionary equivalent of Cobdenite middle-class Liberal orthodoxy, though colonial oYcials frequently found such missionaries meddlesome and uncontrollable in the Weld.66 A more explicit imperial Christianity developed in the 1890s, in a revival of Christian imperialism combined with appeals for support based on imperial agendas that tended to shade into a jingo- istic Christian imperialism.67 So, for Greenlee and Johnston, British Protestant Christianity ‘was for the most part comfortable with imperialism’ by 1900, when it received a rude shock from the Boer War and the Boxer Rebellion, which began to undermine existing hopes of religious cooperation with a moral empire.
 Porter has, accordingly, argued for a historical revision of the mission- aries’ relationship with both colonial and imperial governments—a relationship that missions could not always avoid—on the basis that they generally subordinated that imperial connection to their own religious commitment. Whether they were for or against the British Empire, missions and missionaries were generally propagandists of Christianity before they were political or cultural supporters of the imperial enterprise.68
 But the prevailing view of historians remains that British Christian- ity, in all its variations, was generally supportive of empire in principle while, at times, criticizing some colonial practices as immoral or unjust, particularly to indigenous peoples. This connection existed from the genesis of England’s Protestant identity in the sixteenth century and persisted until the twentieth, when more critical questions about empire began to be raised substantially for the Wrst time within British mission societies and churches. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the export of a saving and only true faith in Protestantism was accepted as at least oVering support for English territorial expan- sion. Trade and commerce became more important than religious values as reasons for imperial expansion in the eighteenth century, but during that century these became allied with the idea of Britain as a champion of Protestant liberty in its commercial wars against France.
 According to Christopher Bayly, with the loss of thirteen of its North American colonies British imperialism revived around a newly conW- dent conservatism in which aristocratic and autocratic values were emphasized alongside the establishment of the Church of Eng- land.69 That church was understood to be especially valuable in reaYrming conservative social values at home and the inculcation of imperial loyalty in overseas colonies where it was to be promoted, with state support, to British settlers and non-Anglican Christians.
 middle classes, allied with the Whigs, began to support free trade capitalism as a moral force, at odds with oYcial support for a mon- opolistic Anglicanism that was becoming politically impractical after the enfranchisement of Catholics and Nonconformists in the late 1820s. That retrenchment of government support for Anglicanism, allied with the increasing inXuence in British society of inter-denom- inational Evangelicalism, gave fresh impetus to all forms of British Protestantism to engage with imperialism in the form of expansive missions to the heathen peoples of the empire. Generally the result was that British Protestantismwas imperialist throughout this period. That this included a strong dimension of cultural imperialism, which sought to remake in Western ways indigenous identities in colonized societies, has—as we have seen—been the subject of debate, though British Protestants at the time generally accepted as be part of their civilizing agenda in the mission Weld. However, it remains true that scholars proposing such cultural imperialism have failed to address the diversity within the supposed cultural uniformity of British Protest- antism because they have largely conWned their investigations to Evangelical missions. Where they have paid attention to non-Evangel- ical missions, most scholars have also argued that Anglicanism, and particularly non-Evangelical Anglicanism in the form of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, was the most uncritically imperialist of all the varieties of British Christianity. For example, while he does not develop his remarks in detail, Jonathan Clark believes the SPG in the eighteenth century embraced the Wrst British Empire within ‘a single imperial vision’.70 It is the purpose of this work to identify what that vision was for the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
 I will argue that it was the SPG that began, for Anglicans, a sustained and conscious construction of empire. In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, as the principal Anglican body focused on the empire through its concern for missions, the SPG was able to unite Anglicans in England in contributing to this construction, because for the Wrst time in the history of the Church of England there was a corporate body focused on the empire. In doing so, Anglican clerical leaders of various theological and political hues, and their missionary clergy, developed a number of themes, some 70 Clark, Language of Liberty, 173.
 of which have been identiWed by scholars with regard to Protestantism and empire. The SPG protagonists pushed these further in the service of a particularly Anglican understanding of what God and their country required of the established church in this imperial endeavour.
 A British Protestantism, as posited by Colley, may have been too diverse and internally oppositional to provide a common factor for British national identity. However, an Anglican construction of imperial identity was on oVer for some British Protestants, from 1701, through the publications of the SPG. This Anglican religious cons- truction of an English–British imperial identity was a virtual SPG monopoly for most of the eighteenth century, but was gradually joined by other voices as Evangelical and colonial Anglicans, such as the CMS, began to contribute their own understandings of empire by the Wrst half of the nineteenth century.
 Nevertheless, it is reasonable to regard these sources as providing more than an individual body of authorial opinion, for these pub- lished views were those of either the summit of the authorized Anglicanism of their day, or of clergy regarded as experts because of their colonial or missionary involvement. In these sources they were not mere private persons, but leading clerics or missionaries setting forth their views in major publications of missionary agencies connected to the Church of England. Therefore, the texts written by these preachers, colonial bishops, missionary bodies, and colonial clergy and missionaries have a good claim to be regarded as indica- tive of the outlook of contemporary oYcial Anglicanism.
 realities in the colonies, such ideals were still powerful and inXuential promoters of imperial understanding within the Church of England and beyond.
 But these ideals, disseminated in Anglican public arenas, include—in addition to those already mentioned—the reports of colonial bishops and, by the second decade of the nineteenth century, an Evangelical Anglican audience reached through the house journal of the Church Missionary Society, the Missionary Register. That source, which went well beyond Anglicans to a wider Evangelical audience, was published from 1813 to 1855 and spread the views of metropolitan and colonial Evangelical Anglicans to a wide British missionary public throughout Britain and the colonies.
 There are, of course, problems with all these colonial sources. The Weld reports were written largely by clergy, which gave the colonial laity little public voice, though some lay representation is found intermittently. The reports were also written to the colonial clergy’s and bishop’s major metropolitan supporters and therefore tended naturally to accentuate the positive and eliminate, or at least reduce, the negative aspects of missionary success. Even more signiWcantly, in all these colonial sources the voice of the indigenous peoples, and of women, is almost totally silent, so that they had no direct input into the Anglican discourse of this period—making it, consequently, a predominantly clerical, male one, with some inXuence from particu- 76 Porter, Religion versus Empire?, 10–11.
 larly inXuential laymen at home or in the colonies. This, however, was entirely reXective of the social centres of power not only in the Church of England during this period, but in Britain and the colonies it created.
 In his book on the autodidactic tradition of the British working classes, Jonathan Rose has pointed to the work of the sociologist Erving GoVman in his analysis of his subjects’ world views, or what GoVman terms the ‘frame’ or ‘the organization of experience’. Rose explained this ‘frame’ as ‘ground rules for processing information’ about the world as we experience it.77 So this book asks: what was the ‘frame’, or the set of fundamental interpretative themes, provided by these English metropolitan and colonial Anglicans for their Anglican audience to use in their appropriation of a view on the empire? How did these institutional Anglicans frame publicly—albeit ideally—the world of the British Empire with respect to the Church of England and its mission there? This investigation seeks to identify the com- ponents of an Anglican construction of a frame of empire for the period of the eighteenth century and the Wrst half of the nineteenth century, when new settler colonies were underway in North America, Australia, and New Zealand, and Anglican institutional expansion began in India.
 But a Wnal question of methodology needs to be addressed here, particularly for the eighteenth century, for which the SPG is our only oYcial public source for amissionary and colonial Anglicanism. How characteristic of Anglicanism were the views expressed by these SPG preachers, colonial clergy, missionaries, and bishops? That they were certainly signiWcant in their own right as the public views of the accredited leaders of the Church of England at home or in the colonies during this period has already been argued. But do they have a wider importance, as promoting views shared by a wider group of Anglicans than just those in episcopal or clerical leadership? It is always diYcult to ascertain with any degree of certainty how far the views of any public speaker or reporter agree with those of his or her audience. However, that these speakers did share their outlook with 77 Jonathan Rose, The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 4, 6–7.
 a reasonably wide body of Anglicans during this period does seem likely, given their context.
 As the invited and accredited annual preachers of the society, or the oYcial reports of its accredited missionaries and colonial bishops, the Anglicans examined here promulgated their views with at least the concurrence, or even the active agreement of its members. By 1705
 SPG members included all the bishops, and numbers of clergy from every diocese in England andWales. In 1714 a branch was established in the Church of Ireland, which included all its bishops, though just three laity.78 By the later years of the eighteenth century the society’s membership was just a few hundred members, though these still included all the bishops and higher clergy.79 Membership reached a nineteenth-century peak of 4,500.80 But SPG inXuence was wider within the Church of England than just its membership. Its strength always lay in the fact that its royal charter and its episcopal member- ship meant it was enmeshed in the organizational structure of the Church of England, which gave substance to its claim that it was the oYcial missionary arm of that church. Its mostly clerical member- ship, and its regularmonthly meeting attendedmainly by bishops and some lay dignitaries,81 plus its published annual reports and sermon, enabled the small amount of missionary interest that did exist in the eighteenth-century Church of England to be focused and organized.
 It also meant there was an organization for the dissemination of the views of this party, with numerous copies being sent to the society’s missionaries overseas for distribution there. In the early years of the nineteenth century the society also retained the involvement of important Evangelicals such as Josiah Pratt, sometime secretary of the Church Missionary Society who, in 1814, was trying to get the work of the SPG more widely known beyond its circle of mostly clerical members. Therefore, the views of the society’s preachers and reporters certainly represented, in addition to its membership, a wider body of Anglican sympathizers in England and its colonies—of various theological hues—until at least the early nineteenth century.
 78 O’Connor, Three Centuries of Mission, 10. 79 H.P. Thompson, Into All Lands: The History of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, 1701–1950 (London: SPCK, 1951), 104. 80 Ibid., 231. 81 Ibid., 104.
 This constituency was sectional in the sense that it formed a minority of Anglicans—namely, those who were interested in missions in the parts of the world that fell to their society by virtue of its charter— that is, the British colonial territories. However, in another sense, this membership was more likely to encompass a broad cross-section of the clergy of the Church of England because, for most the eighteenth century, the clergy were less divided than they were either at its beginning or in the nineteenth century. There were certainly Wssures within the eighteenth-century Church of England, especially during the acrimonious divisions of High and Low Church groupings in the Wrst two decades. But signiWcantly, the SPG was able to embrace both High and Low, Tory and Whig Churchmen, even during that ‘rage of party’. For example, when the backgrounds of the preachers before the society between 1701 and 1714 are examined, one of the most obvious aspects to emerge is their diversity. Not surprisingly in a period that was politically dominated by upholders of the Revolution settlement of the crown upon William and Mary, most of the preachers were Whigs. These included bishops Hough, Lloyd, Burnet, Trimnell, Fleetwood, and Kennett. But there were some Tories, among them William Beveridge, a High Tory with deWnite nonjuring sympathies; Sir William Dawes, a Hanoverian Tory; and DeanGeorge Stanhope. In addition to these High Churchmen,most of the preachers in this initial period of the society’s history were Latitu- dinarians, particularly the Whigs Lloyd, Burnet, Hough, Williams, and Moore. Charles Trimnell was a Whig who maintained the aVection of his mostly Tory clergy because he was a non-partisan man and an assiduous pastor in his diocese.82 Therefore, from the early eighteenth century the society attracted bipartisan support from leaders of the Church of England.83 This continued into the early years of the nine- teenth century, when Evangelically minded bishops such as Beilby Porteus, Henry Ryder, and Charles Sumner still felt able to accept invitations to preach the society’s annual sermon.
 82 Charles J. Abbey, The English Church and its Bishops, 1700–1800, vol. 1 (London: Longmans, Green & Co., 1887), 155–6. 83 G.V. Bennett, The Tory Crisis in Church and State (Oxford: Oxford University After the factionalism of the early eighteenth century clerical divisions were largely limited to small, theologically radical minor- ities. Peter Nockles and David Newsome have drawn attention to a broad ‘orthodox’ consensus that embraced most of the Church of England clergy in this century. The Church of England in the Wrst half of the nineteenth century was predominantly, but vaguely, High Church (though the label was eschewed for its pejorative party connotations), but some were more so than others, and a minority were more extremely Evangelical or Latitudinarian.84 It is within this broad High Churchmanship that most of the Church of England clergy were found; so also were the members of the SPG and the bishops and deans who preached to them. Therefore, the SPG preachers and their clerical audience broadly shared a common eighteenth-century Anglican viewpoint. It is true that by the late eighteenth century the emerging party of Evangelicals increasingly departed from this theological concord with their revived Calvinism, their emphasis on personal conversion and fervour, and their more systematic evangelistic activism, until the High Churchmen caught up with the latter characteristic in their missionary activity from about 1830. But there remained suYcient accord between the two groups of Anglicans until about 1830 for the SPG to invite Evangel- ical bishops to preach, and for Evangelicals to be members of the society. This broad theological compatibility within the ranks of the clergy was basically to endure until the rise of the Oxford Movement in the 1830s, which radicalized High Churchmanship and drove a wedge between new and old High Churchmen, and between them and the Evangelicals.85 Consequently, the SPG sermons and reports of the eighteenth century come mostly from a period of comparative agreement, broadly speaking, among Anglican clergy; though the 84 Peter Nockles, The Oxford Movement in Context: Anglican High Churchmanship, 1760–1857 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 27–31; David Newsome, The Parting of Friends: the Wilberforces and Henry Manning (Leominster: Gracewing, 1993), 318. 85 Nockles,OxfordMovement, ch. 6; For the same phenomenon in the largely High Church Scottish Episcopal Church, see Rowan Strong, Alexander Forbes of Brechin: The First Tractarian Bishop (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), ch. 4; and Episcopalian- ism in Nineteenth-Century Scotland: Religious Responses to a Modernizing Society (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), ch. 5.
 colonial and evangelistic concerns of the Anglicans quoted here put them in a minority among their colleagues for that century.
 In the nineteenth century the signiWcant, but rather clerical, Anglican support base of the SPG began to be widened organiza- tionally to embrace the laity on a much broader scale. The society’s Wrst parochial association was formed in 1819, though growth was hampered by the society’s decision to artiWcially restrict its member- ship by setting expensive membership fees—a policy that lasted until 1850.86 Another growth-restricting factor was that the SPG suVered from the strengths and weaknesses of the increasing partisanship that emerged in its parent church towards the end of our period, and it gradually became a rather more consciously party-oriented, High Church organization than it had been during the eighteenth century, and even the Wrst decades of the nineteenth. This gave it a new support base, and an identity distinguishable from its more vigorous Evangelical counterpart, the Church Missionary Society. However, it did so at the expense of its former Anglican breadth, though it retained its oYcial character as an accredited society of the Church of England. By the end of the period, missionary-minded Anglican clergy and laity tended to devote themselves to either the SPG or the CMS according to their High or Low Church proclivities. But this had not been so for the eighteenth century, or the early nineteenth, when the SPG had fewer supporters that, nevertheless, represented a greater breadth of the Church of England. It is to embrace that more divided Anglican world of the mid-nineteenth century that the major Evangelical Anglican publication, The Missionary Register, the house journal of the CMS, has also been used as a nineteenth-century source in this research. However, for most of the period examined in this book the divide between Evangelical and High Church Anglicans in their engagement with empire had not yet grown into the chasm it was to become, so that both sources speak with a cohesiveness that may seem surprising to those who are more familiar with the High and Low Church war that raged in the later nineteenth century.
 The Construction of an Anglican Imperialism: British North America in the Eighteenth Century At 8 o’clock on a wintry February morning in 1702 Dean Richard Willis mounted the pulpit of St Mary-le-Bow to preach a new sort of sermon before his invited London audience. His was the Wrst sermon on behalf of the new society formed to encourage long-term support for Anglican Christianity in England’s overseas colonies. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel to Foreign Parts (SPG) began that year a tradition of sermons preached on the anniversary of the day of its incorporation by royal charter in 1701. The setting, in one of Sir ChristopherWren’s new churches built after the Great Fire of London, epitomized in wood and stone the resurgent Anglicanism that had developed since the restoration of the Church of England in 1660. The society his congregation were in London to support would transmit that revitalized Anglicanism from the metropolis to the English colonies of North America. Wren’s church that day was alive with dignitaries of church and state seated before the preacher on an occasion that expressed the Church of England’s new mission to the English colonies overseas that that church had too long neglected.
 Under its royal charter the society was enjoined to care for the Anglican religious needs of English colonists and to make ‘other pro- vision’ for spreading the gospel to these English territories.1 From its beginning, and on into the century, the SPG enjoyed support across the traditional divisions of Anglican clergy between Whig and Tory, 1 H.P. Thompson, Into All Lands: The History of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, 1701–1950 (London: SPCK, 1951), 2.
 High and Low Church. Later preachers continued to be drawn from the diversity of the Anglican leadership, though the predominance of Whigs among the bishops reXected the hold on power this party retained for most of the eighteenth century. However, Whigs included both High Churchmen such as Edmund Gibson of London and Low Churchmen such as Francis Hare of Chichester. There was a continued smattering of Tories, such as Thomas Sherlock when he was Dean of Chichester. Later in the century the society’s faithful were addressed by Bishop Martin Benson, a friend to early Evangelicalism, and Beilby Porteus who, although not a Calvinist, was in other respects an Evan- gelical. The principal focus of these clerical leaders was the promotion of the vision of the founder of the society, the Revd Thomas Bray, of an Anglican mission to English colonies, which in the eighteenth century largely meant North America and the West Indies.
 Enduring English settlement in North America had begun with the founding of Jamestown in Virginia in 1607, although the later estab- lishment of the Plymouth colony by English Protestant Separatists from Holland in 1620 has become more famous in the history of the United States. These latter colonists were Puritan English, dissenting from the Church of England, who believed God had revealed America at just the right time for them to escape a religiously corrupt Europe.2
 During the seventeenth century the legal establishment of Angli- canism was instituted in some of the North American colonies.3
 Anglicanism was established in this way in Virginia, Maryland, and North and South Carolina, and the eighteenth century witnessed a reinvigorated Anglicanism in these and other North American colo- nies through the agency of the SPG. The society was almost totally focused on the North American colonies during that century, and sent 309 clergy to them between 1701 and 1783. These clergymen founded 300 churches beyond the Anglican stronghold of Maryland.4
 to America were always hard to Wnd, and the society’s work was largely funded by private subscriptions, along with intermittent donations, and oYcial collections initiated by a ‘Royal Letter’. Six of these oYcial fundraisers in the Wrst eighty years raised money from various towns and cities in England and brought the society £65,110.5 During this period the average annual income of the SPG was £580 from sub- scriptions and £1,905 from donations.6 This colonial mission was successful enough in targeting white non-Anglican colonists to induce the conversion of some prominent Congregationalist ministers, among whom was the head of Yale College in 1718.7 But the on- going lack of colonial supervision of Anglicanism in the form of a bishop in North America severely hampered the direction of the Church of England there. So all episcopal decisions had to be taken by the Bishop of London, who was too far away to be eVective. But the inroads of the SPG into North American Dissenting territories did prompt the foundation of a number of colonial Protestant associations that began to counter-attack by invading Anglican ter- ritory in the Middle Colonies, and that saw oV an abortive attempt by the royal governor of New York and New Jersey to protect the Church of England. The increasing religious pluralism of the North Ameri- can colonies was further exacerbated by the immigration of diverse religious groups from Britain and continental Europe, which largely kept Anglicanism in North America centred upon Virginia and Maryland.8
 Notwithstanding a focus on white settlers, one of the most obvious ingredients of the Anglican perspective of the SPG, right from its inception, was to see the empire as the opening up of territories of missionary opportunity, an opportunity required to be taken up by the society as a consequence of gospel imperatives. In 1704 John Hough, the Bishop of Exeter, who was surprisingly praised by the anti-clerical Alexander Pope and Horace Walpole,9 insisted that the society’s missionwas amatter of obedience to the gospel. Commenting 5 Thompson, Into All Lands, 36–7. 6 Ibid., 102. 7 Schlenther, ‘Religious Faith’, 132. 8 Ibid., 135. 9 Charles J. Abbey, The English Church and its Bishops, 1700–1800 (London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1887), vol. 1, 130.
 But quite early on it became apparent that neither the indigenous peoples themselves, nor many of the colonial SPG clergy, saw it that way. By 1724 it was being reported that most SPG missionaries were Wnding all sorts of reasons for neglecting their ministry to the natives in favour of the English settlers in South Carolina and Virginia.28
 conversion than they had in the preceding century with the English Puritan missions.29 Perhaps it was the missionaries’ reports of the diVerence between the native peoples within and those beyond the pales of settlement that led the metropolitan Anglicans, by the 1730s, to begin to advocate ‘civilization’ as a preliminary to conversion. By this time the society’s preachers were Wnding less and less in common between the English and the Native Americans, in tune with the reports of their North American clergy. Dr Cutler in Boston reported in 1734 that a native woman, as a consequence of his baptizing her, had left behind ‘the Barbarity of her kindred in which she was educated’.30 The following year his colleague, the Revd Miln in Albany, New York, passed on the comments of the commanding oYcer of the garrison at Fort Hunter that thanks to Miln’s ministry the Mohawks had grown more civilized and orderly, observing the Sabbath. The implication was that this was a surprising development, because more often the picture was of the indigenous peoples as persistently uncivilized.31One of Miln’s successor’s, the Revd Ogilvie, reported on the degrading eVects of alcohol on the native men, making them drunk enough to burn their own huts and abuse wives and children.32 He maintained in 1752 that nothing could be done with the Mohawks until there was a viable scheme to ‘change their present habit of Thinking and Acting, and may instill the Principles of Virtue and Piety into their minds’, preferably by teach- ing them English and instructing them ‘in proper houses’.33 Two years later Ogilvie seems to have put some of this scheme into operation by taking one of the Mohawk boys, dressing him in English clothes and teaching him English suYciently to read in the Psalter.
 to oppose it. To both metropolitan and colonial contexts of the SPG all of this was subsumed under the motif of barbarity and the need for European civilization. Yet there had been indications since the seventeenth century that some Indians were interested in Christianity, though they were, like the Mohawk parents, not prepared to relin- quish their own control over how they appropriated it.35
 In fact, so wide was this gap between Native American and Anglican-English becoming that the natives’ apparent lack of civil- ization was raising questions about their essential humanity, some- thing that had not been so evident in earlier sermons. In 1732, the society’s preacher went into this requisite step of civilizing indigen- ous peoples at some length. The obsequious and nepotistic Bishop Richard Smalbroke of LichWeld and Coventry believed that the inhabitants of North America required to be civilized Wrst because they were more savage than those of South America—who had, after all, built and inhabited cities. The peoples bordering English colonies in the north lived in a state of nature that was devoid of the civilized conveniences of life. Taking aim at the current European idea of the noble savage, he maintained such a state of nature was not a state of innocence. The idea that primitive men (and it was a gendered concept) were free of the rather artiWcial baggage of civilization and were consequently able to realize the natural virtuousness of human- kind was an old idea given contemporary currency by the poet John Dryden and the philosopher John Locke. On the basis of the power of natural reason working on the sense data of experience Locke gave the concept new philosophical life in the eighteenth century.
 The requirement for the Native Americans to undergo a trans- formation from barbarism to civilization remained a constant motif for SPG Anglicans for most of the eighteenth century, largely cross- ing the political divisions and diVering social backgrounds of the eighteenth-century Anglican clergy. It became the benchmark for assessing whether indigenous subjects of mission had achieved a satisfactory and adequate transformation from heathens to Chris- tians. However, there are some indications of isolated patches of greater cultural awareness of their native subjects by some colonial SPG missionaries, in the burst of enthusiasm for native missions in the 1760s that followed the British victory in the Seven Years’ War.
 the colonized, which paralleled the external invasion of the North American continent by the French and English in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.52 These European conquerors used religion to attempt to exterminate the native peoples’ cultural identity and replace it with a Europeanized alternative. In response, the natives resisted as best they could by seeking to revitalize their own culture, or by adopting a syncretistic amalgam of indigenous and Christian religious outlooks, or—for a minority—by giving themselves over completely to the new Euro-Christian identity. This latter option was more prevalent among the English Puritan missions of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries because the English, unlike the French Jesuits,53 were not amenable to distinguishing between Christianity and European culture. This distinction by the Jesuits made permissible the retention of some native cultural mores in areas deemed non-essential to the gospel. Axtell has very little com- ment to make upon the SPG missions, as his study of the English missions is largely conWned to those of the Puritan New Englanders of the seventeenth and eighteenth century. But it is clear that it was the cultural Xexibility of the Jesuits that was exceptional in the colonial setting; the English were more or less an extreme example of the European cultural chauvinism exhibited also by the French and Spanish colonial authorities and their religious counterparts.
 ‘Civilization’ as an English remaking of all aspects of indigenous life in their own image had been the prevalent strategy and ethos of the Puritan missions and praying towns of seventeenth-century New England. From the 1730s, and for the rest of the eighteenth century, the SPG Anglican preachers took up this older view of their Puritan English forebears in colonial North America.
 While the indigenes’ resistance to this civilizing agenda may have disheartened SPG Anglicans, abandoning their mission was not contemplated, because they framed the English–British Empire within a theological imperative. Maximizing opportunities for heathens to accept the salviWc requirement of belief in the Christian gospel was, in their view, the divine purpose of God in granting England her overseas territories in the Wrst place. In 1707 the High Churchman William Beveridge was among the Wrst of the society’s preachers to express the belief that there was a providential purpose behind England’s territorial acquisition overseas. ‘Now, that we have so many Factories settled in Asia and Africa, and so many Colonies in America, all among the InWdels and Heathens, whereby we may have the fairest Opportunity that ever can be oVered, to open their Eyes, and turn them fromDarkness to Light, from the power of Satan to God.’ He backdated this providential acquisition of territory by the English to the geographical discoveries of the previous two centuries, by which the guidance of God had provided the English with the opportunity to preach the gospel to all the world.57 Dean White Kennett, later Bishop of Peterborough, in 1712 similarly urged a commitment to mission in America as the providential consequence of the English ‘discovery’ of North America.
 This conWdence in the imperial religious purpose of Anglican Christianity was no doubt encouraged by the growth in English, and then British, overseas colonies by the mid eighteenth-century.
 English settlement of Calcutta began in 1690; Britain’s sovereignty of Hudson Bay was conWrmed, and of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland gained, as a consequence of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, under which it also received Gibraltar and Minorca from Spain; new col- onies of the Carolinas and Georgia were established; and there were more ‘factories’ (trading stations) around the coast of India. Modest by comparison with the second half of the century, these acquisitions were nevertheless signiWcant to contemporaries when compared to the paltry English expansion of the previous century. This develop- ment continued to be understood by these Anglicans as an imperial territorial blessing by God, carrying with such providential favour a divine condition of evangelism for its maintenance. In the very Wrst anniversary sermon of the SPG, Richard Willis advocated the pro- motion of colonial evangelism as a means of demonstrating to God that England took its religion seriously, for otherwise God could remove from the nation the protecting providence he had so recently shown them in the outcomes of the 1688 Revolution.
 Gilbert Burnet in 1703 also proposed a similar theological connection between domestic and imperial destinies when he advocated the society’s colonial work as part of the domestic campaign for the refor- mation of manners in order to bring down a blessing from God upon the politics of the nation, securing to England the blessing the Revolu- tion had brought it.69Dean Stanley in 1707 suggested the same equation by commenting that the continued failure of those in a position to promote colonial religion was one reason for God not granting more success to England’s Xeets, which may have been a reference to the successful French raid on the islands of St Kitts and Nevis in 1706 as part of the War of the Spanish Succession.70 Stanley went on to suggest that current indiVerence towards religion among the inXuential orders of society could be dire for England’s imperial circumstances.
 Just a year later, when God had apparently granted success to English arms (perhaps in the capture of Minorca in 1708 or the successful raid on Cartagena),72 without any improvement in the oYcial promotion of colonial religion, Sir William Dawes proposed that government support for missions was a very appropriate way to 68 Richard Willis, Dean of Lincoln, A Sermon (1702), 22–3. 69 Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, Of the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts: A Sermon Preach’d at St Mary-le-Bow, Feb. 18 1703 before the Society Incorpor- ated for That Purpose (London, 1704), 29. 70 J.H.

 While the expansive imperial relationship of the English with God was undoubtedly conditional upon support for colonial evangelism, it was also a relationship these Anglicans interpreted commercially within the imperial context. The SPG preachers developed an imperial theology that used trade and commerce as a metaphor for England’s imperial alliance with God. In the inaugural sermon Dean Willis set missions in the empire within a commercial theology of exchange by explaining that they were a just and appropriate return for the riches England derived from its colonies and plantations.81 In 1703 Gilbert Burnet, one of the political architects of the 1688 Revolution, com- plained that while England had the greatest commercial advantages of any Protestant nation, it made the poorest return for these blessings of any European nation by way of missions to its overseas territories.
 ‘just debt’ for the many beneWts trade had brought the British.89 The Dean of Lincoln conceived of the work of the society entirely within the framework of a commercial metaphor. It had been, he said, ‘incorporated . . . to establish, the most beneWcial Commerce with them [our colonies], in Requital for the temporal and perishable Riches which we receive from them; to import to them our spiritual Things, and Treasures which will never perish; and to send them something in Return, besides our Vices and Criminals’.90
 Conceiving of imperial religion commercially, these preachers were appealing, therefore, to a well-understood contemporary value. At the heart of commerce as a synonym of culture, and central to the empire, lay trade, conceived by these Anglicans as having positive religious dimensions. Dean Stanhope believed that in trade lay the hope of peace for the world, as nations became mutually interde- pendent. One of the direct beneWts of this should be an increase in English charity expressed in evangelism towards indigenous nations in the colonies. ‘Be the Strangers, with whom we correspond for supply of our own Necessities, of Birth and Climate never so remote; common humanity obliges us to do good, where we receive Good; and some way to service Them, of whom we take such care to serve our Selves.’ Trade was not simply to be commercial gain, because England received more of value than it gave in such trade and these rewards obviated the principle of charity. A genuine Christian com- merce ought to proceed upon this principle of charity and supply the spiritual wants of those who increased English temporal comforts.
 Boyd Schlenther maintains that the expanding commercial culture of eighteenth-century Britain most directly aVected religion in the North American empire by facilitating colonial religious pluralism and thereby fending oV Anglican and Congregational attempts at monopolistic religious establishment. Trade provided the opportun- ity for settlement, and consequently the opportunity for religious exile or emigration to the colonies. It also prompted the internal migration within the North American colonies that promoted reli- gious pluralism because trade routes opened up diVerent parts of the country to missionaries and diverse religious groups. But trade could also have negative consequences for religious expansion. The West Indian direct dependence on the slave trade, and the North American indirect dependence on it—due to its West Indian trade—meant that colonial clergy felt themselves prevented from attacking slavery.
 In the North American colonies it was the Great Awakening of the mid eighteenth century, according to Schlenther, that was primarily responsible for cementing within religion this culture of commerce.
 transaction between the individual and God.94 This commercial and individualized Christianity took deep root in North America and, by opposing it, Anglicanism made itself seem foreign. Colonial Angli- canism in the North American colonies demonstrated that the old model of religious life, based on monopolistic parishes and the landed order, would not survive the new commercial culture of colonial religious pluralism.95
 But the evidence of the SPG sermons suggests that Boyd Schlenther’s view that commerce, trade, and religion interacted particularly around the period of the Great Awakening needs some modiWcation.96 The inXuence of a commercial paradigm for colonial religion was already present in metropolitan Anglican understanding at the beginning of the eighteenth century. This earlier, Anglican, commercial theology predates the campaigns of George WhiteWeld who, according to Frank Lambert, initiated a successful adaptation of the commercial practices of a rising consumer society in the service of his transatlantic Evangel- icalism.97 It is also older than the nineteenth-century link between commerce and Christianity that Brian Stanley found to be a connection between British imperialism and British Evangelical missions.98
 The essentially spiritual condition of tenure for their empire as a requirement for its continued colonial wealth that these eighteenth- century Anglicans constructed necessitated the English also accepting responsibility for the eternal destinies of their colonists. While it is true that generally the SPG preferred to concentrate its resources on the faith of English colonists rather than indigenes, nevertheless that work was understood as also having an evangelistic motive.
 This metropolitan Anglican construction of a degenerate colonial identity was also propounded in colonial reports in the decades before the American Revolution. The Revd John in Stratford, New York, wrote that his converts had gone from ‘a loose and very irregular Way of living’ to one of ‘Sobrierty, Virtue and Industry’.
 Neither was this discourse of colonial regression into unfaithfulness limited to the SPG colonial clergy; it was also bruited abroad by Anglican settlers themselves in the hope of obtaining a resident minis- ter from the society. In 1755 the settlers in the Pennsylvania counties of York and Cumberland petitioned that for want of clergy, ‘Ignorance prevails among them, Superstition creeps in apace, the Lord’s days are vainly and idly spent, their Children Strangers to the publick Worship’.110 The next year the society received similarly argued peti- tions from George Town and Frankfurt on the Kenneback River, New England, who, as Protestants from Britain, Ireland, France, and Germany, as well as native New Englanders, found it hard to ‘keep alive the Sparks of religion in themselves’. As a consequence ‘their Children must be in evident Danger of falling to the greatest Ignorance and Irreligion’, as well as becoming ‘easy prey to the Popish Missionaries in the Neighbourhood’.111 The Revd Frinke in Augusta, Georgia, in 1766
 It was acknowledged that this lack of religion was not entirely the fault of colonial indiVerence, but also sprang from the daily grind for survival on the colonial frontier. Not only were religious resources, such as churches and clergy, lacking in these areas, but there was little leisure or energy left over from the Wght for subsistence to devote to religion. The Dean of Wells maintained in 1733 that the necessities of colonial existence, and the drive to become wealthy and return home, too quickly took over the colonists.113 The Bishop of St David’s agreed, saying in 1749 that ‘among our Brethren in our Colonies Abroad . . . the pressing Calls for immediate Subsistence, and for clearing and cultivating their new Settlement, gave, at least for many Years in their Beginning, little or no leisure to keep alive and maintain, much less improve that Degree, whatever it might be, of Christian Knowledge they brought with them.’114 The colonial SPG clergy continued to share this dim view of many English colonists’ religion. The missionary at Augusta, Georgia, writing in 1767 that he had made some attempt to evangelize the local native people, reported that not only did that avail little, but the local whites also were ‘as destitute of a Sense of Religion as the Indians themselves’.115
 But there was another outlook deriving from the colonies that viewed the white colonists in a more positive light, as successfully struggling to maintain their religious and civilized identity. But this version of colonial life Wgured only intermittently in the SPG’s public presentations, probably because it was not as suited to promoting support for their cause among their English audience. It is also seems evident that, in some cases, this more encouraging view of colonial 112 SPG, Proceedings (1767), 68. 113 Maddox, Sermon, 26–7. 114 Richard Trevor, Bishop of St David’s, A Sermon (1749), 18. 115 SPG, Proceedings (1767), 68. 116 Ibid., (1760), 62.
 religion could have been reported by the society’s clergymen as a gilding of the lily about their own work in order to keep themselves on the payroll. But while giving them the beneWt of the doubt, there did appear to be to an overall disregard of a more positive interpretation of the colonial situation. So the minister at Newcastle, Pennsylvania, on a tour in 1720 of SuVolk County, preached at one settlement where the people had built their own church, ‘notwith- standing their Discouragement for Want of a Minister’.117 In North Carolina in 1722 the SPG clergyman said that he oYciated at six or seven places in the colony to full and numerous congregations, baptizing some 193 people, including Wve adults.118 In the same year at Lewestown, Pennsylvania, the missionary reported that in two out of the three places on his regular itinerary the people had built their own churches before they had any prospect of a minister.
 Laymen had been appointed to read Morning and Evening Prayer, which had kept the people ‘steady to their Principles’.119 At Bristol, New England, the people had already spent over £1,500 on their church and ‘numerous’ among them attended on a Sunday, includ- ing many who, before the arrival of the clergyman, ‘were Strangers to the Liturgy of the Church of England’.120 Dr Cutler in Boston in 1732 reported that for the services he took at Didham some of his congregation rode between ten and Wfteen miles to be present at the monthly Holy Communion.121
 But the SPG’s public discourse on the empire, as published in their Proceedings and annual sermons, generally preferred overall to keep to the theme of colonial religious and moral decline. For some it was a fault of the irreligious history of colonial settlement. The Bishop of Gloucester believed the problem was that British colonization had got oV to a good start that went wrong. The priority given to religion by the Wrst Dissenting English to arrive in North America was not continued by their successors, who put their material fortunes far ahead of any interest in religion.122 Two decades later the Bishop of St Asaph drew a similar lesson from colonial history, seeing English settlement as a tawdry record of good intentions about 117 Ibid., (1720), 54. 118 Ibid., (1722), 49. 119 Ibid., 50. 120 Ibid., 52. 121 Ibid., (1732), 51. 122 Benson, Sermon, 18–19.
 the establishment of religion, as evidenced in the various grants and charters of the colonies, which manifestly remained still to be fulWlled by the colonists who went there.123 The reason for this lay in the colonial context that fostered an ‘abandoned way of living’; possibly also, as far as plantations went, from the corrupting experience of exercising absolute command over slaves or, more generally, from the low-lifes, such as convicts, who were transported to the colonies as punishment. ‘National characters are formed by various circumstances; and we may justly attribute a good deal of what is bad in our colonies, to their being peopled on diVerent occasions by many loose, vicious, and lawless persons, destitute of means to live here; and by criminals; who perhaps might be brought into better order, if they were not sold there to private persons, but employed by the publick.’124
 Returning to Britain after the failure of the funding to materialize, Berkeley continued to lobby for such a college, and shared his experi- ences with the society in his sermon as a means of doing so. Berkeley maintained that the SPG did make a diVerence to colonial life when it concentrated on the re-evangelization of colonists.
 Berkeley was naturally accentuating the positive in order to invigor- ate funding for his college. His words would have fallen on fertile soil, as his hearers drew the obvious lesson that the mission propagated by the society could indeed redeem colonial society from its potential slide into irreligious barbarism through a provision of the infra- structure for religious life and practice.
 In addition to religious degeneracy, Anglicans also found the colonial world threatened by religious perversion in the shape of Roman Catholicism, for them an erroneous form of Christianity.
 the colonies, and was an active member in the society. In 1711
 his sermon gave the most extensive treatment of the relationship between the English and their empire of any of the SPG preachers in the Wrst decades. He chose not to dwell on the blessings England had received from her colonies, but rather to highlight the obstacles in the way of Christian missions among indigenous peoples. The Wrst of these hindrances was due to the Christian nations ‘aVecting Conquest and usurping temporal Dominion, rather than enlarging the Kingdom of Christ’. Kennett maintained that all peoples had a title and hereditary claim upon their native land, and had the right to resist those who sought to conquer them. Too often in Christian history the faith was expanded through martial means and war called holy, Wrst in the crusades and then by the Catholic Spaniards.
 Kennett needed to contrast English occupation in the Americas with the Spanish because his Anglican view of imperial mission was driven by the traditional theological trope of a truthful, pure English Protestantism in conXict with a superstitious, erroneous Catholicism—a trope that had operated in Anglicanism since the Reformation.132 Consequently, Kennett constructed an Anglican interpretation of English imperial history that had as its foil an exploitative, rapacious Spanish imperialism. Against this Catholic Spanish empire he maintained an English territorial expansion that did not infringe upon the freehold rights he aYrmed the Native Americans possessed. In a variant of Locke’s argument, Kennett maintained that the English only took over lands left abandoned by their former owners who had Xed to places of greater safety further 131 Kennett, A Sermon, 5–11. 132 See for example Anthony Milton, Catholic and Reformed: The Roman and Protestant Churches in English Protestant Thought 1600–1640 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995).
 inland, or had died from pestilence. It was an Anglican construction of English imperialism that ignored English dispossession of native peoples in seventeenth-century America. So English plantations were upheld as benevolent, acknowledging the property of the original inhabitants by entering into commercial alliance with them, and fairly purchasing their land. According to Kennett, whereas Spanish imperialism was military invasion, the English version was peaceful and just; a commercial transaction with the original owners of the land. This Anglican narrative of England’s empire permitted Kennett to maintain in a new imperial context the old national theological motif of English Protestant righteousness and superiority over Cath- olicism. This theological superiority could be reconstructed for the eighteenth century as English moral commercialism over Spanish oppressive militarism in the English imperialism these Anglicans were promulgating.
 In 1713 one of the missionaries claimed Roman Catholic priests either baptized without instruction, or cajoled converts by threats or bribes. It seemed to vindicate the traditional anti-Catholicism of the Anglicans, though the information came not from the missionary but from his Dutch interpreter, who may well have been giving the colonially inexperienced clergyman what the interpreter knew he wanted to hear, or what he himself, as a Protestant, also believed.138
 Even into the mid and later eighteenth century, the society’s North American missionaries were still warning of dangerous competition from Roman Catholic priests. In Newfoundland in 1744 the minister urged the society to supply a Protestant schoolmaster to oVer an alternative for the large number of children currently attending the local Catholic school and consequently ‘in great Danger of imbibing the corruptions of Popery’.139 In 1760 the Provost of the Church of England College in Philadelphia, which had been established in 1749 with the initial support of the usually anti-religious Benjamin Franklin,140 lumped together Roman Catholics and Quakers as causes of perversion to the settlers in his bid for the appointment of a missionary at Reading, Pennsylvania.141
 So anti-Catholicism played a major role in the early construction of an Anglican imperialism. Catholicism—whether that of Spain, with its long history of New World missions, or (in North America) of France—was a powerful ‘other’ for Anglicanism in this period.
 Dean Willis’s 1702 sermon particularly highlighted as a motive for mission the reproach that fell on the English Church from the older Roman Catholic missions. He expressed the hope ‘that it shall never more be said, that they of the Church ofRome aremore Zealous to promote Superstition and Idolatry in the World, than we are to promote the true,uncorruptedReligionof JesusChrist’.142He therefore encouraged his hearers to Wnancial generosity to remedy this ‘defect’, which he called a ‘reproach’ to their church and nation. Rome, as the antithesis of a Christian and benevolent Anglicanism, was also held up by Bishop JohnWilliams in 1705, when hemade a connection between English religion and English identity by observing that the lack of missions was a standing reproach to them not only as Protestants but also as ‘English-Men’.
 This was an Anglican imperial antithesis that would serve again later in the century, when the principal colonial rival became France rather than Spain. Bishop Henry Edgerton of Norwich in 1728 urged the society’s supporters to be provoked further by Catholic mission- aries spreading ‘Error, Superstition and Idolatry’.143 Bishop Benson in 1739 believed that as the English had freed themselves from popery so they had a duty to spread this deliverance throughout the world by promoting ‘Primitive Christianity’, a common metaphor for the ecclesiastical and doctrinal purity of the Church of England.144
 The best of all possible Christian worlds epitomized by this conW- dent Anglicanism was not only threatened by Rome but also by Protestant Dissent among theNorth American colonists. This became a major theme of the SPG’s missionaries during the 1730s and 1740s, with further alarms raised by the enthusiasm of the Evangelical Revival there in the latter decade. It was a patchwork picture of 142 Willis, Sermon, 21–2. 143 Edgerton, Sermon, 19. 144 Benson, Sermon, 21.
 push and shove from these colonial reports. In the 1730s reports were coming in of successful Anglican proselytism among Dissenters, for example in the Carolinas, Long Island, and Rhode Island.145 But from 1740 the society began to receive reports of the inroads of Revivalism, which at Wrst seemed to be beneWt rather than bane. While the Revd Isaac Brown in Brook Haven, New York, reported on the telling eVects of Barclay’sApology for the Quakers, which had recently arrived and was becoming inXuential among his people,146 the missionary at Stratford, New England, believed his people remained immune from the variety of itinerant Revivalist preachers. These, he said, had scared the settlers with ‘their dismal Out-cries, that their Bodies have been frequently aVected with surprizing Convulsions, and Agitations; and these Convulsions have sometimes seized on those, who come, as mere Spectators, and are no Friends to the new Methods, even without theirMinds being at all infected’. Portraying the new religious Revivalism as a disease, the Revd Johnson reported that three or four families had turned to the Church of England as a remedy against such contamination.147 As well as disordered bodies, other clergymen told of the moral disorder generated by Revival becoming a cause of Dissenters turning to the Church of England. In Jamaica, Long Island, the Revd Colgan claimed his church was in a Xourishing condition because of the backlash against the immoral practices of enthusiastic preachers, which corresponded with the experience of his colleague in Stratford who also spoke of these revivalists’ antinomianism.148
 But other reports suggested greater Revivalist inroads into colonial Anglicanism. In Chester, Pennsylvania, while maintaining that his people persevered in ‘Religious Principles’, the priest also admitted that a month before he had ridden forty miles to Pequea, where he found that some parishioners had ‘grown giddy brained with Methodism, and had refused to come to Church’, though he had had some success among those he had been able to talk with.149
 The missionary at Radnor in Pennsylvania admitted that people had left the Church of England to follow enthusiastic preachers, but they had now returned.150 Ironically, one of the Dissenting ministers in Pennsylvania was reported by the clergyman at Chester to have expressed his gratitude that he had so many Church of England people in his congregation because they were not prone to give themselves up to the ‘wild Notions and enthusiastical Ravings’ of the Revivalists.151 The itinerant missionary in New England admitted that Enthusiasm had unsettled many people ‘from all sober and steady Principles, that great prophaneness and Disregard for the instituted means of Grace appear’, and that he had been unsuccessful in reversing this loss.152
 By 1743 the SPG in London was reXecting an increasing anxiety about the disorder created by the Revival. The letters it received from New England pointed to ‘the wild Doings of Enthusiasm’. Their New England commissary, writing from Boston, spoke of how people were being consumed by the eVects of the doctrines of WhiteWeld and his followers. These prevailed chieXy in country towns. However, to that point the Church of England had escaped such disturbances.
 Enthusiasm was a ‘Contagion’, an ‘Infection’, a ‘Phrenzy.’154However, after the 1740s the ensuing decades returned to the more familiar story of either good relations between the Church and Dissent, or of Dissenters inclining to the Church of England,155 so that by the second half of the century the metropolitan Anglican leadership came to the comforting—though misguided—view that the threat of a new Enthusiasm had been largely seen oV.
 But the new imperial world of the Anglicans, threatened as it was by prominent Catholic missions and enthusiastic Dissent, was not just populated by heathen natives and near-heathen colonists.
 In 1727 Bishop Edmund Gibson of London, whose inXuence with Robert Walpole led to him being dubbed ‘Walpole’s pope’, wrote a public letter to plantation owners supporting the evangelism of their slaves.163 As Bishop of London, Gibson had a customary responsibility for Anglicans overseas and in the plantations, which he entered into with customary zeal for his own responsibilities. He turned this into a royal commission issued under the Great Seal in October 1726, and reissued in 1728.164However, his great industry in seeking to establish jurisdiction over colonial clergy was nulliWed by its impossibility due to distance, colonial opposition from more powerful laymen on vestries, and weak colonial churches.165 The bishop was conWned to issuing 162 For some of the ingredients of this generalized human nature see Roy Porter, Enlightenment: Britain and the Creation of the Modern World (London: Penguin, 2000), ch. 7. 163 Edmund Gibson, Two Letters of the Bishop of London, the First, to the Masters and Mistresses of Families in the English Plantations Abroad; Exhorting Them to Encourage and Promote the Instruction of their Negroes in the Christian Faith. The Second, to the Missionaries There; Directing Them to Distribute the Said Letter, and Exhorting Them to Give their Assistance toward the Instruction of the Negroes within Their Several Parishes (London, 1727). 164 Norman Sykes, Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London 1669–1748: A Study in Politics and Religion in the Eighteenth Century (London: Oxford University Press, 1926), 337–9. 165 Ibid., 341–2.
 licences, appointing toothless commissaries, and oVering advice and admonition to clergy through a weighty correspondence. This ineVec- tive energy was redoubled when he replaced the senile Archbishop Wake as acting president of the SPG until the appointment of John Potter to Canterbury in 1737. Appalled by the lack of progress of the Church of England among the plantation slaves, Gibson appealed to male and female slave owners on the basis that slaves were not on a level with beasts but were human men and women. They had ‘the same Frame and Faculties’ as their owners, with ‘Souls capable of beingmade eternally happy, and Reason and Understanding to receive Instruction in order to it’.166 As if that aYrmation of a human identity were not enough, Gibson also published a further address, calling upon all serious Christians to support the work of the society to enable catech- ists to work among the slaves. He asked his British and colonial readers to remember that the blacks ‘were truly a part of our nation, living under the sameGovernment with ourselves, and contributingmuch by their labour to the support of our Government, and the increase of the trade and wealth of the kingdom’.167 The same human ontology was aYrmed by the Bishop of Lincoln, four decades later in 1768, for whom the Negro slaves were ‘partakers with us of the same nature’, and although steeped in ignorance and gross superstition they were entitled as fellow humans to be treated humanely.168
 Unfortunately this metropolitan Anglican construction of colonial society in which owners were identiWed as sharing a common hum- anity with their slave chattels was not an approach likely to endear the SPG or its missions to the slave-owning societies of the West Indies or the American colonies. In 1729 the missionary at Lewes, Pennsylvania, reported that since the distribution of the bishop’s letter he had received permission from slave owners to instruct a few slaves, just nine black adults and some children.169 Another colleague, in 1730, reported being unable to do anything to meet requests for baptism from blacks. Those applying showed every sign of having a knowledgeable and practising Christian faith but he could do nothing because they had no permission from their owners, 166 Gibson, Letter to Masters, 25. 167 Quoted in Sykes, Edmund Gibson, 365. 168 Green, Sermon, 19. 169 SPG, Proceedings (1729), 41–2.
 This metropolitan ecclesiastical view of British slavery was also unlikely to make any headway in the colonies because in these societies the slave owners were too powerful, especially in the colon- ial Church of England. Institutionally, that church was weak in the North American and West Indian colonies. It lacked any strong local ecclesiastical authority by way of bishops, senior clergy, or church courts. This deWciency created a vacuum of power that was quickly and permanently Wlled by the lay elites who were the same people who owned the plantations and the slaves. The metropolitan church was simply too far away to make its writ run against the overweening power of the laity in colonial parishes and vestries. Consequently, one historian of American slavery has observed that no Anglican attack on slavery could be made eVective. The scant resources of the SPG were swamped by the needs of white colonial society, even if most of its clergy had been inclined (which they were not) to attend to converting the blacks.172
 From the beginning SPG colonial reports demonstrate an acute sensitivity to the local power of the slave owners, who, colonial missionaries knew, were the key to the success or failure of the sporadic attempts by some of the society’s clergy to work for con- versions among the slave population. Around 1702 the Revd Samuel Thomas had been sent to Goose Creek, South Carolina—one of the largest rural towns in that colony—where he began Christian instruction for many slaves. But in 1706 he died of fever after a period 170 SPG, Proceedings (1730), 93–4. 171 Winthrop D. Jordan, White over Black: American Attitudes toward the Negro, 1550–1812 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1968), 183–4. 172 Ibid., 206–8; Woolverton, Colonial Anglicanism, 70.
 in England.173 The Wrst colonial report to mention slaves in the SPG’s published Proceedings, in 1713, was from the Revd Ebenezer Taylor of St Andrew’s parish, South Carolina, who felt a sense of Christian responsibility for catechizing Native Americans and black slaves in his parish. He reported a lack of cooperation from the slave- masters in his work. However, he spoke of the initiative of a Mrs Lila Haigne, who had lately arrived in the plantation, and of her com- panion, a Mrs Edwards, who had made what he termed ‘extraordin- ary Pains’ to give Christian instruction to a considerable number of slaves. This had resulted, he claimed, in ‘wonderful success’, so that in six months time he had been able to catechize the slaves who had been able to answer his formal question, ‘Who Christ was’ with ‘He is the Son of God, and Saviour of the World’. They could also recite the Apostles Creed, Ten Commandments, and Lord’s Prayer.
 Five decades later the society’s preacher was still appealing for the society to make its estates exemplary models of Christian slave owning, arguing that such ownership by the society was a providential 176 Williams, A Sermon, 21–2. 177 Gibson, Letter to Masters, 21–4. 178 The bequest was intended by Codrington to fund a college devoted to the study of divinity and medicine, whose graduates would undertake missionary work in the West Indies and live under the religious vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Perhaps such popish notions were the result of Codrington’s retirement in 1703 from his post of Captain-General of the Leeward Islands to spend the rest of his life studying metaphysics and church history; clearly a religiously unsettling combin- ation!

 Notwithstanding the continuing oppressive conditions on their own plantations, the society’s preachers continued throughout the eighteenth century to see slavery as an opportunity for evangelism, though there was only a very intermittent amount of this in actual colonial fact. The Revd Hunt, in St John’s parish, South Carolina, dismally reported in 1724 that while there were above 1,400 slaves in his parish he knew of only one who was baptized.184 Even the 181 John, Sermon, 20–1. 182 Harry J.

 dedicated catechist to the blacks in New York in 1720 could only point to Wfty-Wve adults and twenty children under instruction in the previous two years.185 The attitude of the Revd Barnet in Brunswick, North Carolina, may have been widespread. Reporting on the growth of New Light Baptists in his parish, he mentioned with incredulity that these Dissenters permitted ‘even Negroes [to] speak in their Meetings’.186 Clearly a converted or a freed slave had more oppor- tunities for involvement, and even leadership, in some of these Revivalist congregations than among the Anglicans, which cannot have made the latter any more attractive to those the society’s clergy were seeking to convert. By mid-century there was only sporadic reporting on any engagement with the black slaves, apart from the New York catechist. What mention of slaves that did occur invariably spoke of the obstacles placed in the way of those interested clergy by the hostility or indiVerence of the plantation owners.
 However, from the late 1740s there are indications that some among the society’s metropolitan supporters were becoming uneasy about the slave trade. This discomfort predates the generally accepted beginnings of the British anti-slavery movement in the 1760s,203 and suggests that some eighteenth-century Anglican consciences were not completely stilled by their humanitarian advocacy of a more lenient 199 Ibid., 33. 200 Smalbroke, Sermon, 37. 201 Maddox, Sermon, 28–9. 202 Ibid., 20–1. 203 J.R. Ward, ‘The British West Indies in the Age of Abolition, 1748–1815’, in Marshall, Oxford History of the British Empire, vol. 2, 425.
 By 1787 British abolitionists had gathered suYcient momentum to launch a public movement for the end of the African slave trade. The campaign climaxed in 1807 when abolition of the trade was enacted, and in 1833 when slavery itself was outlawed in the British Empire. It brought together various sections of British society, including radical and Evangelical politicians, organized Evangelicalism, and some High Churchmen. Consequently, from the 1780s the society found itself under increasing attack from abolitionists for being a slave owner. Its response was the continued advocacy of a programme of reform without abolition. In 1783 Bishop Beilby Porteus of Chester, who would become Bishop of London in 1787, speaking at the end of the American War of Independence, clearly hoped to refocus the work of the society around slaves in the British Caribbean colonies.
 Essentially this was the same programme the English had proposed for the indigenous peoples in their North American colonies since the seventeenth century. The society’s Anglican slave plantation would be turned into a Barbadian version of the old Puritan praying town. Both the indigenous and the imported colonized peoples would be totally controlled in order to replace their own cultures with that of a complete English makeover, to Wt their subjects for a suitably lowly place in English society and economy as farm labour- ers. Religion was proposed as a major ingredient in fostering upon Native Americans and slaves an identity as non-white Anglicans and as nearly-but-not-quite English villagers. But the bishop’s sugges- tions were peremptorily rejected by the society.212

 older interpretation, more favourable to the SPG, was argued by the American historian Frank Klingberg in the 1940s. He viewed the SPG programme as one of humanitarianism in that it accepted slavery while at the same time working for its reform and amelioration. It was a pragmatic response to the power structures of the day, which would have completely discounted emancipation. For the society to have adopted abolition, in his view, was both anachronistic in the earlier eighteenth century, and certain to have resulted in its total exclusion from all contact with slaves in the face of implacable plantation-owner opposition. Instead, the society’s programme of engaged humanitarian amelioration and reform of brutality to slaves was, Klingberg argued, both ‘creative in its ideology of a new social conscience, and yet prosaically practical . . . The strategy in demand- ing support and cooperation from vested interests which opposed humanitarian principles, and in showing that proWts and the civiliza- tion of the labourers might be developed in ratio to each other, was both bold and well sustained.’215 Consequently, Klingberg saw the SPG as amajor component of an Anglican imperial humanitarianism, which successfully worked to be ‘an ameliorative and civilizing agency’ among both Native Americans and slaves.216 Acceptance of the planters’ argument that baptism did not constitute emancipation, as the society did, was a necessary position for it to adopt, in Klingberg’s view, if it was to get past the overwhelming power of the planters in the colonies and in the British Parliament. To do otherwise would have shut the door to this particular mission Weld in the society’s face. However, in so doing the society neither fell into the extreme position of the planters’ side in denying the essential humanity of black slaves nor, on the other hand, the absolutism of abolitionists.217 Rather, the society adopted what would nowadays be called a policy of constructive engagement with a slave-owning regime they fundamentally did not agree with. In doing so, and in setting what Klingberg claimed was a constructive example in their own estates, the SPG played a major part in the eventual emancipation of slaves in the British Empire, helping to foster a new climate of anti-slavery 215 Frank J. Klingberg, Anglican Humanitarianism in Colonial New York (Phila- delphia, 1940), 189. 216 Ibid., 189–90. 217 Ibid., 170–1.
 opinion whose views eventually outran the moderation (in mid eighteenth-century terms) of the society itself.218 ‘If emancipation had been the Wrst cry, missionary work for the Negro would have remained an idle London dream . . . SPG policy was a union of high idealism with practical realism.’219
 her master. But the society left it to others to carry through the natural conclusion of this work, in the campaign for the abolition of slavery to which the SPG always remained opposed.
 The formulation of a theology of slavery and of empire as, in part, a support for existing political and economic powers in the contemporary British state, inevitably meant that these Anglican leaders had to make a response when that status quo was challenged in the American War of Independence (1775–83). The war, and the consequent loss by Britain of thirteen of its North American colonies, which constituted the new United States of America, caused the society’s preachers at the centre of the empire to reiterate Anglican beliefs about the existing political and religious system at home and abroad. The cudgels were Wrst taken up before war commenced by Jonathan Shipley, Bishop of St Asaph, in 1773. In a sermon largely devoted to the unity of the empire he began by framing Britain as a nurturing imperial power, treating its colonists since the seventeenth century ‘with the indulgence due to their weakness and infancy’ until they Xourished under the benevolent protection of their mother country. In fact, the bishop assured his audience, ‘there is no instance in the records of time, where infant colonies have been treated with such a just and liberal indulgence’, in contrast to the oppressive regimes their colonies have endured from other European empires.221
 Four years after Shipley’s sermon, in 1777, William Markham, the Archbishop of York, was prompted by the suVerings of SPG loyalist clergy to consider the causes of the American conXict. Some of these were, he said, the responsibility of the government. However, no more than Shipley was Markham going to be drawn further on this dangerously radical course of political criticism in a public forum.
 The next year, Brownlow North of Worcester also lamented the devastation the war had caused to the SPG mission, which he por- trayed as a consequence of the Church of England’s support for constituted established rule. ‘But if it is the oVence of the Church of England, that she hath been the ancient friend and companion of the constitution of England . . . in respect both to the civil and spir- itual liberties of the people in England, her union with the state hath been most happy.’ He lauded his church’s upholding of religious toleration, despite its place as the established church, a position he was conWdent was a necessary ingredient in social peace and order as against the American situation of a plethora of competing sects; a truth he was sure the Americans would come to discover for themselves. ‘History hath put it beyond doubt, that an equality of sects under one government, without any established church at all, is a chimerical idea, and totally inconsistent with religious order and peace.’228
 empire. These divisive inXuences had shown in the colonies their true colours as the ancient opponents of English government and church.
 The only hope of a good outcome now was Divine Providence, and he recalled his audience to the necessary conditions for this providential intervention: true (that is, Anglican) religion and Wrm (pro-imperial) patriotism.229
 Notwithstanding the eventual loss of Britain’s North American em- pire south of the St Lawrence, many of the same themes identiWed during the period of the Wrst British Empire continued to Wgure prominently in the society’s sermons after the loss of the thirteen southern colonies. In 1787 the Bishop of Bangor was still upholding the familiar theme that religionwas the basis of the commercial success which had brought Britain her empire. Indeed, he conceived it would be impossible to maintain a commerce with a people who had no religion, as there would be no depending on such a non-virtuous people, as against people who were ‘religious, sober and frugal ’.230 The Bishop of Norwich in 1790 continued to extol the interconnection between church and state. The state existed for civil order, of which religion is the greatest guarantee; and the Christian religion, as ultimate truth, must be upheld by the state. Both church and state—in the case of Britain, which had ‘established dependencies in the remotest part of the earth’—had an obligation to extend to them the gospel of Christ as ‘that pearl of inestimable price’.231 Such a pearl was intended by God to be distributed universally, saidWilliamCleaver of Chester, in an equally common theme of eighteenth-century SPG Anglicanism. Christ in- tended his religion to be propagated universally in order that the redemption of humankind by Christ may be eVected.232
 Outside the SPG the same theological conWdence in the divine basis and destiny of Britain’s empire was also being publicly proposed in the late eighteenth century by other Anglican clergy. In 1775, in an Assize sermon no doubt prompted by the outbreak of the American war, the prominent High Churchman George Horne, then President of Magdalen College and later Bishop of Norwich, preached on 229 John Thomas, Bishop of Rochester, A Sermon (1780), 22–5. 230 John Warren, Bishop of Bangor, A Sermon (1787), xxxiv. 231 Lewis Bagot of Norwich, A Sermon (1790), 14–16. 232 William Cleaver, Bishop of Chester, A Sermon (1794), 3–4.
 So for those Anglicans in the latter part of the eighteenth century who did stop to consider the British Empire, its fortunes were as enmeshed into the scheme of Divine Providence as Anglicans had long conceived it to be. Subject to various criticisms and conditions 233 George Horne, The Providence of GodManifested in the Rise and Fall of Empires: A Sermon (London, 1775), 20–9. 234 Luke Booker, Britain’s Happiness: An Assize Sermon Preached at St Mary’s Church, Warwick, on Sunday the 1st of April, 1792: Exhibiting an Historical Review of Providential Interpositions in Favour of the British Empire, a Faithful Representation of its Present Prosperity; And Recommending a Line of Conduct to Prevent its Declension or its Fall (London, 1792), 6–14.
 The inauguration of the SPG in 1701 was a consequence of a new awareness of the need for overseas mission that developed among some inXuential leaders of the Church of England as a result of the growth in England’s colonial territories. It meant that among a number of prominent English Anglicans there was a consciousness of a need to evangelize among the indigenous peoples of these territor- ies, but also among the slaves on English–British plantations, and even among the settlers themselves whose hold on Christian faith was regarded as inadequate, if not tenuous. The SPG therefore kept alive in English metropolitan and colonial Anglicanism an awareness of the religious dimensions of English and then British imperial devel- opments, even if this was only Wtfully fulWlled within the actual colonial context.235 The preachers, missionaries, and members of the SPG who took up this new vision of an overseas imperial Anglicanism included the clerical leaders of the church as well as colonially engaged clergy, and they began to construct in their reports and sermons an eighteenth-century Anglican discourse of empire for their hearers and readers. This discourse, as it was published and distributed through the SPG, developed a framework for their Anglican audience to understand the empire within a religious and theological outlook. It produced the Wrst sustained institutional Anglican public discourse of empire, and of the imperial responsi- bilities of an Anglican Christian nation.
 This eighteenth-century Anglican imperial discourse developed a number of evident motifs. The theology of providence was prom- inent in maintaining that it was God who had granted overseas territories to the English. While these colonies and plantations had brought wealth to England, the SPG Anglicans aYrmed that the divine providential purpose in so doing was principally to bring 235 In 1707 annual subscriptions totalled just £759, and the next year the total annual income was still under £1,000, though disbursements exceeded this. Members were not always prompt in paying their dues, including some of the bishops. In 1708 the Bishop of Gloucester asked to be removed from the list of subscribers. Everts Boutelle Greene, ‘The Anglican Outlook on the American Colonies in the Early Eighteenth Century’, American Historical Review, 20 (1914), 67.
 English retention of their colonies was therefore conditional upon England promoting colonial Christianity. If this was not accom- plished then not only was there a risk that God could remove his providential imperial bequest, but it would also place in jeopardy God’s particular providential protection of England itself, which had been so recently demonstrated in the Glorious Revolution, and before in England’s Protestant history.
 The relation between God, the English, and their empire was envisaged as analogous to the commerce that these Anglicans recog- nized was at the heart of English expansion. God had provided material beneWts to the English, and in exchange they needed to return to God spiritual wealth in the form of Christians in the New World. The colonial context of this commercial theology was pro- pounded as entailing a proWtable return in the form of greater trade to the English from the Native Americans, who would be impressed by the fair dealing of the virtuous and godly English. Charity and religion were, therefore, sound commercial and imperial principles.
 This Anglican construction of an imperial discourse also moved traditional anti-Catholicism into a new arena. Since the Reformation English Protestantism had regarded Catholicism as the very opposite of the Christian gospel, which was found only in Protestantism.
 However, this discourse of a just English territorial expansion sat uncomfortably with their acknowledgment of ‘some’ English oppres- sion and immorality, but also with the fact of Catholic evangelism preceding their own, in some parts of their empire, by centuries.
 While the foundation of the SPG countered this latter Catholic reproach to a godly Protestantism, Anglicans were concerned that English immorality and brutality in the New World threatened to identify English Protestantism with its deceitful Catholic rival.
 This willingness of these Anglicans to formulate a theology of baptism that oVered no threat to slave-owning society demonstrates the dominance of a landed and commercial hegemony in English society and its colonies to which the Church of England institu- tionally had to subordinate itself. This Anglican construction of empire was prepared to challenge the prevailing powers over some issues, such as the church’s reiterated demand for a colonial episco- pate.238 However, the deliberate disempowering of the social conse- quences of baptism, which continued to be upheld in this Anglican discourse even when emancipation was being argued for by other lobbies (religious and otherwise), was an acknowledgement that power lay ultimately not with religion, or the Church of England in the eighteenth-century empire, but with colonial landowners and traders and their allies in the metropolitan Parliament. The formula- tion of a discourse of slavery around amelioration rather than eman- cipation, and the virtual non-existence of any such amelioration on the plantations themselves even into the late eighteenth century, demonstrates that, in this respect at least, the Church of England acted as a ‘hegemonic instrument’ for the maintenance of the power of the ruling groups in colonial North America and theWest Indies.239
 The clearest evidence of this subordinate role of the Church of England in the propertied, commercial, and political hegemony of eighteenth-century Britain came when the two interests clashed, as they did over slavery, but also over the question of the appointment of bishops in the North American colonies. This had been a goal of the society and of leading English bishops since the beginning of the century, as it was recognized that the lack of such authority and institutional focus had a deleterious eVect on the strength of 238 Carl Bridenbaugh, Mitre and Sceptre: Transatlantic Faiths, Ideas, Personalities, and Politics, 1689–1775 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1962). 239 Walter L. Adamson, Hegemony and Revolution: Antonio Gramsci’s Political and Cultural Theory (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980), 173–4.
 the colonial church. As early as 1709 the Bishop of Norwich was lamenting the absence of a proper episcopal authority in colonial North America, which made decision-making in the colonial church cumbersome and inadequate.240 The Dean of Canterbury, preaching in 1713, believed a colonial bishopric would be greatly conducive to the encouragement of piety, manners, and discipline in the col- onies.241 The society’s preachers were still battering on the same project three decades later, when Bishop Secker in 1740 drew atten- tion to the risks for aspiring young clergymen having to cross the Atlantic for ordination in England,242 and the lack of the rite of conWrmation for colonists, not to mention ‘orderly discipline’ for their clergy.243 Clearly, for an episcopal church such as the Church of England, the lack of colonial bishops was a fundamental hindrance to its colonial polity and development. Bishops were necessary for ordination, conWrmation, and the provision of a local ecclesiastical authority capable of dealing both with internal matters of dispute and discipline, and able to meet colonial administrators and the powerful clergymen of other Protestant denominations on more or less equal terms. An episcopal church without bishops was a queer creature indeed. Odd it may have been, but it endured in this deWcient state for the entire time that Britain ruled the old North American empire, despite the best eVorts of the church’s English leadership. In addition to the more or less permanent agitation of the SPG’s preachers, Archbishop Tenison left the handsome bequest of £1,000 towards its realization, and the powerful Thomas Secker, while Bishop of London (and subsequently Archbishop of Canterbury), unsuccessfully lobbied Horace Walpole for colonial bishops in 1750.244
 These were all various attempts in the sustained campaign for a colonial episcopate by the Church of England, which reached its peak during the 1750s and 1760s.245 Secker wanted two or three 240 Trimnell, Sermon, 22. 241 Stanhope, Sermon, 31. 242 In 1753 the SPG would report that Wve of twenty-Wve candidates for ordination from New England perished on their crossing the Atlantic, either from disease or drowning.

 suVragan bishops to be ordained for America. He sought to circum- vent Parliament, arguing there was already legislation permitting the ordination of assistant bishops, who could be sent to the colonies instead of the current commissaries of the Bishop of London, who were only priests and thus were unable to perform episcopal functions. He drew attention to the fact that Parliament had recently permitted Moravian bishops in North America, and tacitly allowed Catholic ones. Secker spent much eVort emphasizing that such colonial bishops would have no authority other than spiritual juris- diction over Anglicans only, and were therefore no threat to the position and rights of other churches. There was no intention to replicate the civil and parliamentary powers of English bishops; nor was he concerned that such powerless bishops might prove to be a Trojan horse for their English counterparts.
 Some have apprehended . . . that it will . . . aVord the laity here an example of English bishops abroad, with no other than spiritual powers: which may tempt them to think of reducing us at home to the same condition. But I should be very willing for the beneWt of those of our communion in the colonies, to run a greater risk, than I conceive this to be. For the fact is so notorious, that all our temporal powers and privileges are merely concessions from the state; and the act of parliament for the suVragan bishops, under which several were made in the last century, and others may now, exempliWes as fully the possibility of bishops without peerages, and consistory courts; that we need have no fear of any new discovery to our prejudice, from appointing a few such bishops in America.246
 The crucial point for Secker was that such a colonial episcopal presence was necessary to the identity of the Church of England in North America, and to the maintenance of its ordinary life, pointing out that ‘indeed it belongs to the very nature of episcopal churches, to have bishops at proper distances presiding over them’. As it was, in a bishop-less North America, mostly second-rate British clergy had to be sent over, with many of these being Episcopalian Scots who, as possible Jacobites, ‘may be disaVected to the government’.247
 However, Secker, who at the time was the lowly Bishop of Oxford, 246 Secker, A Letter, 497. 247 Ibid., 492–3. For the reasons behind Secker’s political use of the theological Jacobitism of the Scottish Episcopal Church in the eighteenth century see Rowan lacked the punch to overcome the government’s opposition to his proposal. Walpole, the younger brother and close collaborator of Sir Robert Walpole, was, understandably, mindful of the oppos- ition the proposal would spark among North American and English Dissenters.248
 Nevertheless, despite all these obviously cogent arguments, the Church of England never achieved its desired colonial bishops, because such an initiative ran up against the government’s political agenda. As the historian of colonial Anglicanism in North America correctly observed, the ship of colonial episcopacy proved unable to navigate around the rocks of colonial Anglicans’ indiVerence to it; the successful colonial and metropolitan agitation of powerful Congregational and Independent clergy opposed to it on the grounds that it was a threat to their liberties;249 and the imperial government’s anxiety about the good order of the colonies as a consequence.250
 Archbishop Secker’s latest biographer believes that this failure to comprehend the power of dissenting inXuence over the question in the New England colonies and at home was at the heart of Anglican inability to achieve success on this issue.251 Bishops could, and Strong, Episcopalianism in Nineteenth-century Scotland: Religious Responses to a Modernizing Society (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), ch 1. However, it seems clear that this religious Jacobitism did not, with very few exceptions, translate into open or even covert rebellion among the Scottish Episcopalian clergy or bishops after the abortive 1715 uprising.

Walpole’s reply to Secker’s lobbying in 1750 indicated the strength of Dissent’s political agenda with regard to the North American colonies and the prospect there of bishops: The dissenters of all sorts whom I mention with no other regard or concern than as they are generally well aVected and indeed necessary supporters to the present establishment in State, and therefore should not be provoked or alienated against it, will by the instigation and complaints of their brethren in the colonies although with no solid reason be loud in their discourse and writings upon this intended innovation in America, and those in the colonies will be exasperated and animated to make warm representations against it to the Government here, as a desire to establish ecclesiastical power in its full extent among them by degrees, although the Wrst step seems to be moderate and measured, by conferring the authority of bishops to be planted amongst them to certain colonies and functions.
 did, oppose the government on various matters in Parliament. For example, most of the bishops ineVectually opposed penal legislation against Scottish nonjuring bishops after the 1745 rebellion.252 Bishop Gibson in 1734 Xatly refused to accept the nomination of Dr Rundle to be Bishop of Gloucester because he strongly doubted his doctrinal orthodoxy; and the bishops in 1736 opposed the government openly in the Lords over the Quakers Tithe Bill, which they felt threatened the livelihoods of the clergy.253 But despite all the metropolitan agitation, both in public and privately (such as Secker’s quiet diplo- macy over a quarter of a century),254 the Church of England failed to acquire a colonial episcopate despite it being obvious that this made its identity, order, and strength seriously deWcient in the colonial context.
 The end result was that the Church of England was unable to institute an administrative reform that everyone, including some government ministers, agreed was ecclesiastically necessary but pol- itically inexpedient. It was a consequence of the church’s established position that the political considerations should be paramount. To do more was to risk that establishment, which none of the bishops were prepared to do. By acknowledging that political considerations were superior to the church’s own evident need, the bishops were acknowledging the de facto subservience of the church to Parliament, a relationship that had grown progressively more unequal since the suspension of Convocation in 1717. When it came to a tussle between the church and its political masters, it was no contest.
 Speaking of the issue in 1751, Archbishop Herring admitted, in reference to Bishop Sherlock, ‘that speaking as an Ecclesiastick, he & I agreed, but as this was a point of Policy in our Government, I thought our Governors the only Judges of it’.255 Even on such a fundamental aspect of Anglican identity as colonial bishops, the Church of England remained subordinate to the propertied power of the political classes in both the centre and the periphery of empire.
 Being subordinate, the church could only hope to achieve its own aims in ways that ultimately supported, rather than challenged, 252 Ibid., 89. 253 Sykes, Edmund Gibson, 265–9, 161–75. 254 Woolverton, Colonial Anglicanism, 225. 255 Stephen Taylor, ‘Whigs, Bishops and America: The Politics of Church Reform in Mid-eighteenth Century England’, Historical Journal, 36 (1993), 351.
 the ruling hegemony. Over matters such as the baptism of slaves, emancipation, and even over its need for colonial bishops, the Church of England was prepared to shape itself to Wt that hegemony, even at considerable cost to its eYcacy, and the consequences for its own colonial identity and vitality. However, at the same time, the unwillingness of the British state to empower the Church of England by agreeing to an American colonial diocese rather casts doubt on the assessment of historians such as Carl Bridenbaugh that the SPG was merely ‘British imperialism in ecclesiastical guise’, as does the intermittent chorus of complaint about the state from the society and the Church of England over this neglect.256 It was indeed a subordinate partnership in the North American empire, but not an Erastian one. The SPG North American mission was, as Andrew Porter has also identiWed, ‘a missionary enterprise dependent on state initiative quite as much as on its anticipation of state support’.257
 It was, in an imperial context, the outworking of a domestic role the church had accepted from at least the Reformation, if not before.
 Fundamentally, for all the Enlightenment inXuence in this eight- eenth-century imperial theology, these Anglicans constructed their discourse of empire on an older, theological, paradigm. For them England, and later Britain, was a Christian nation. This Christian identity drew on a theology of the unity between church and state that had been prevalent in Anglicanism since its foundation in the sixteenth century, and which also went back to a Medieval under- standing of Christendom. A Christian society aYrmed the union of church and state because both were founded by God. England’s national Christianity was expressed constitutionally in the Church of England, and in the requirement of its Christian government to uphold that religion and its national church. In addition, the national church should be supported by the Christian government of England- Britain because the Church of England was among the ‘best’, if not the best, of all reformed churches. Therefore, both because of that church’s excellence, the English–British constitution, and that state’s Christian obligations to God, the government was required to uphold Christianity through the Church of England by supporting the exten- sion of Christianity and the national church both at home and in the colonies. As well, all sections of English society were equally required to do so, as Christians. By carrying out this duty, English society and its government fulWlled its Christian obligation, and its own self-interest, because religion was seen as the basis of morality and social order. The SPG Anglicans were only too well aware that neither at home nor in the colonies did Anglicanism enjoy either a monopoly of religious life or of government support. However, that did not stop them recalling the government and sections of English society to what they saw as their traditional Christian duty, to uphold the national church of a Christian nation at home and in the empire.
 This alliance of church and state undergirded the export of Anglican- ism to the North American English and then British Empire in the eighteenth century—in Anglican consciousness, colonial engage- ment, and metropolitan preaching, if not always in the political or religious realities at home or in the colonies. The alliance failed to materialize in that North American imperial context, but it would receive a Wllip in the so-called Second British Empire, of which the jewel in the crown was India.
 Anglicanism in a Resurgent Imperialism: Following the loss of thirteen of its North American colonies in 1783, Britain continued its territorial expansion in Asia, Africa, and the PaciWc in what historians have come to term the Second British Empire. This was a period when the formal ties of church and state were reinvigorated. A new pattern of close church–state relations, with advantages given to the Church of England in the colonies to shore up the imperial connection, was developed initially in British North America (the nucleus of today’s Canada) and came to be the pattern for the empire until the 1830s. This new political attention given to the Church of England was partly as a consequence of the American War of Independence, which had caused political radicalism to be associated with religious Dissent, and marks a tacit acknowledgement that the government’s refusal to allow the appoint- ment of Anglican bishops to the American colonies had been a mistake. Accordingly, in the newly reconstituted Canada established by the Constitution Act of 1791, there were crown lands set aside as ‘clergy reserves’, and an Anglican bishop was oYcially appointed for Nova Scotia in 1787. The Church of England was now seen as a support for British colonial rule.1 This revival of the connection between church and state had powerful support in Britain from 1 C.A.Bayly, ImperialMeridian:TheBritishEmpireandtheWorld,1780–1830
 Anglican thinkers such as Edmund Burke, and was further cemented by the conservative reaction of the British governing orders to the French Revolution. Burke’s positive views on the church–state alli- ance with respect to the French Revolution, set out in his ReXections on the Revolution in France (1789), have been exhaustively explored by a number of scholars, and do not need any further attention here.2
 With regard to India—both before the outbreak of the French Revo- lution and afterwards—Burke was obsessively concerned with the morality of British rule there, but was not concerned with the church– state establishment in that context (unlike, as we shall see, some of his contemporaries in government and church circles).
 Jonathan Clark and C.A. Bayly have argued that there was a renewed alliance between church and state in Britain and in the empire between the later 1780s and 1830, as part of a revived imperial conWdence after the loss of the thirteen colonies in 1783. The Church of England was to be an instrumental part of an antidote against American republicanism and, soon after, against French revolution- ary fervour.3 Bayly maintains that this period saw a revitalized attempt by the British government to rule a renewed and newly expanding empire on the basis of autocratic government using aris- tocratic military rule and emphasizing accepted values of social hierarchy, racial subordination, and landed patronage. This recon- structed conservatism saw the expansion of government power and inXuence at home and abroad, with the promotion of a new nation- alism centred on the concept of Britain as a Christian version of the Roman Empire.4 Successful British military strength promoted imperial expansion and, coupled with the new nationalism, meant the empire oVered the British ruling classes a remedy to the perceived dangerous social and ideological revolutionary change threatening across the Channel. These classes adopted a consciously protective nationalism of ‘Crown, Church and Constitution’ in the face of this threat.5 So, for Bayly, religion was part of the new ‘constructive 2 For example, Nigel Aston, ‘A ‘‘Lay Divine’’: Burke, Christianity, and the Preser- vation of the British State, 1790–1797’, in Nigel Aston (ed.), Religious Change in Europe, 1650–1914: Essays for JohnMcManners (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997), ch. 9. 3 J.C.D.

 conservatism’ that marks the diVerence between the old and new empires, promoted in association with racial superiority and agrarian autocratic nationalism. In the revived empire, Anglicanism suVused imperialism and inXuenced policy.6
 An integral aspect of this revitalized imperial conWdence in the period from the 1780s to the 1830s was the revival of an Anglican establishment for British settlers and residents in British colonies.
 Until later developments in the 1820s and 1830s brought an end to an Anglican imperial dominance, there were some forty years (between about 1790 and 1830) in which the Church of England played an integral part in a renewed government conWdence and push for empire. This renewed imperialism promoted Anglicanism as one of the major agents of a connectedness between centre and periphery.
 ‘In Calcutta all religions are freely tolerated but the Presbyterian, and they that browbeat. The Pagans carry their Idols in Procession thro’ the Town, the Roman Catholics have their Church to lodge their idols in 6 Bayly, Imperial Meridian, 136–7. 7 Stephen Neill, A History of Christianity in India, 1707–1858 (Cambridge: and the Mohammedan is not discountenanced; but there are no Polemicks, except what are between our High-Church men and our Low.’8 The predominant inXuence in this early period as far as the company’s Anglicanism went has been described as ‘a waning Puritan- ism’, whose clearest expression was a Sabbatarian Sunday.9 However, oYcial Sunday proceedings in some factories indicate little Puritan inXuence. In Surat, for example, although church was held three times on a Sunday, the rest of the day was occupied by feasting, which does not suggest the sort of Sabbatarianism upheld by seventeenth-century English Puritans.10
 While the company accepted some responsibility for religious provision for its own employees, throughout the eighteenth century it was not at all encouraging of the work of its chaplains. Support depended very much on the individual attitudes of its governors, which resulted in a changeable religious policy in its various factories.
 Chaplains, therefore, conWned their ministry to company oYcials.
 They were paid employees, and had oYcial precedence after the governor, but the position did not attract many high-quality clergy- men because of the high European mortality rate in India. Their work was largely conventional pastoral ministry to the European residents, education of their children, and attempts to get churches built to facilitate their religious ministry. The English failure to give priority to their religion in India during most of the eighteenth century was reXected in the time it took for a new church to be built 8 Percival Spear, The Nabobs: A Study of the Social Life of the English in Eighteenth- century India, revised edn. (Gloucester, MA: Peter Smith, 1971), 2–4.
 The Church of England in India during this period, as represented by the company chaplains, was merely one dimension of a colonial social order that consciously sought to be a transplanted reXection of metropolitan society. Consequently, a factor’s wife in 1706 could register a genuine complaint when a surgeon’s wife sat in front of her at church, because this was seen to be claiming greater social precedence.13 During this time there was little concern or engage- ment by the chaplains with wider Indian society or culture; but neither was any more interest in India shown by other British denominations. The missionary interest of the Church of England in India was limited to the Wnancial support that the SPCK gave to a handful of German Lutheran missionaries it had been supporting in South India since 1728.14
 Accordingly, Hastings and those who were like-minded opposed anything more than minimal British interference with Indian life as being dangerous to the company’s rule and proWts. This caution among company oYcials applied especially to any Christian evangel- ism of Indians. Hastings believed that good government necessitated leaving Indians to what ‘time and religion had rendered familiar to their understandings and sacred to their aVections’.15 But this policy 12 Spear, Nabobs, 34. 13 Ibid., 10, 13. 14 This connection continued until these missions were transferred to the SPG in 1825.

 In contrast to the government of Clive and Hastings, successive governors general after Cornwallis entrenched the Europeanizing of the company’s government, limiting Indians to the middle and lower ranks of the administration. In addition, by 1820 British rule had been extended to most of India, either directly or indirectly.17 There- fore, great debate was generated in Britain during the period from the 1780s to the 1830s about what to do with expanding British rule in India. Anglican Evangelical interest in India, for example, was awakened with the advent of the so-called pious chaplains into the company ranks. These were young Evangelical clergymen whose interest in India had been aroused as undergraduates by the fam- ous Evangelical incumbent of Holy Trinity Church in Cambridge, Charles Simeon. The Wrst of this group to arrive in India, David Brown, became chaplain in Calcutta in 1786. These men felt a call to evangelize among the Indians as well as to the European population, but it was a number of years before the Wrst speciWc Anglican missionary arrived in India under the aegis of the Church Missionary 16 Percival Spear, A History of India (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1965), 93–4. 17 Ibid., 95.
 Accordingly, he advocated a prohibition on privately sponsored missionaries, presumably a riposte against the Evangelical missionary societies—which were collections of private individuals—in favour of the SPG as an authorized body of the Church of England.26
 The following year his colleague the Bishop of Chester, Henry Majendie, also advocated a Church of England mission in Bengal, to mirror those already established by the SPCK in South India.
 So by the beginning of the nineteenth century it was evident that the society was becoming conscious of a responsibility both to the British in India and to the evangelization, particularly of the Hindu majority there. But despite this new imperial conquest of a land involving a very diVerent cultural encounter for the British from that of eighteenth-century North America, these Anglicans continued to draw on familiar eighteenth-century themes with only minor alterations to explicate this new colonized society for their metro- politan audience. One of these was anti-Catholicism, which was muted in comparison with the North American mission. Other than Bishop Randolph in 1803, Roman Catholicism was mentioned by only two other preachers in this period. In 1810, the Bishop of Norwich actually praised the work of the Jesuits in Paraguay as exemplars of missionary strategy, along with the Quakers in North America.28 William Howley of London in 1817 believed that had missions depended on human eVort, then Catholic missions in India would have deserved to be more successful because of the organiza- tion and energy they had exhibited. He described their religious orders as ‘distinguished by their ardour of piety and innocence of life’. Instead, their eVorts were undermined by the ‘tenets and man- ners of the East’, the ‘degenerate’ behaviour of Christians there, and ‘the crimes and cruelties of European adventurers’. Still exhibiting some classic Anglican anti-Catholicism, Howley aYrmed that not- withstanding Catholic missionary eVorts it was still a church that adulterated the gospel with erroneous traditions, the dominion of Rome, and counted conversions by numbers rather than sincerity.
 Howley condemned any softening of the customary hostility towards Indian religious culture, criticizing Roman Catholic missions for allowing the continuance of some Indian practices which, for How- ley, was to ‘sanction the ‘‘communion of the darkness with light’’ ’.29
 The mitigation of the traditional Anglican anti-Catholicism in this period probably had a lot to do with the religious consequences of the French Revolution. Anti-Catholicism was already losing ground among the educated elite in Britain in the last decades of the eight- eenth century under the inXuence of Enlightenment liberal thought, especially towards the connection between religious belief and civil and social disabilities.30 English churchmen were convinced that the revolution had become violent and anarchic due to its rejection of religion. Compared with this new threat, numbers of leading English Anglicans found common cause with the dispossessed and persecuted French Catholic clergy in a manner they had never exhib- ited before. French clergy and religious who sought exile in England were assisted by both church and state from the 1790s to the 1820s.
 Their plight conWrmed for English Anglicans the disastrous conse- quences that would result from the severing of church and state.31
 But while contemporary circumstances muted the usual imperial competition with Catholicism, other familiar imperial themes would re-emerge as strongly as ever in the nineteenth-century Anglican discourse on India. These motifs were reinforced from a colonial context once the Church of England had missionaries in the Weld.
 From 1819 the SPG began also to publish reports it received from the Bishop of Calcutta, as one of the new diocese’s major Wnancial backers.
 The CMS had been formed in 1799 as the Society for Missions in Africa and the East (it became the Church Missionary Society in 1812) with a very diVerent model of mission from that of the SPG, 30 Edward Norman, The English Catholic Church in the Nineteenth Century (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), 22. 31 Ibid., 20–1. 32 Neill, Christianity in India, 206.
 which valued its formal connection to the state-connected Church of England through its charter. The CMS was founded by Anglicans who despaired of the encumbrances of this connection in harnessing the new mission energies of Evangelicals. They formed the CMS to be a voluntary agency of Anglicans, independent of the control of the Church of England. Due to the diYculties it had in being securely established it was initially tentative and defensive in its public proWle.
 Only one SPG preacher in the entire period could see any semblance of social beneWt deriving from the non-Christian faiths of India.
 Colonial degeneration of the British in India, among the lower orders of their society, was also a characteristic complaint being heard from the colony itself once an Anglican presence there was established.
 More common than the eighteenth-century trading metaphor for mission was the proclamation of the need for British civilization in India as the anteroom into Christian faith. Attention was drawn to 56 Ryder, Sermon, 4–12. 57 Fisher, Sermon, 4–5. 58 Bathurst, Sermon, 7–8; John Luxmore, Bishop of Hereford, A Sermon (1811), 5. 59 Jackson, Sermon, 8, 13. 60 Bathurst, Sermon, 6–8. 61 Ibid., 17. 62 Howley, Sermon, 6.
 Finally, among these customary themes of an Anglican engage- ment with empire, the doctrine of God’s providence was ever present.
 This sense of an alliance between God and the British nation—or at least the English part of it that was the religious responsibility of the Church of England—was, if anything, more pronounced in this period than during the eighteenth century. This was a consequence of a sense of national peril as a result of the war with revolutionary and Napoleonic France. A signiWcant number of preachers devoted large proportions of their sermons to advocating a sense of mission for Britain’s empire as a national enterprise led by the Church of England. The Bishop of Gloucester in 1805, while admitting British colonization was not without faults, claimed it was, however, free from the atrocities that accompanied Spanish colonialism in the New World. After that assertion he fulsomely laid out the benevolent process of British colonialism, in which religion Wgured strongly, at least in the bishop’s eyes, though it would have been better if that religion had more often been Anglican. ‘Where they [the British] have made their settlements, thither they have carried their Com- merce; and with their spirit of adventure, they blended warm zeal for Reformed Religion. Happy had it been for them, if they had been guided by the principles of our National Church: principles which would have taught them to be serious, but yet mild; to be earnest, but yet tolerant, in maintaining the Ritual Forms of External Service.’69
 The Bishop of Hereford, John Luxmore, in 1811 maintained that there were characteristics of the Church of England that made it pre- eminently suited to spreading Christianity imperially. Its positive use of reason alongside revelation meant it was able to provide support- ing evidence for Christianity accessible to all intelligences. It also meant that the Church of England’s doctrines were accessible by being reduced to primitive simplicity, free of the accreting overlay of tradition. In addition, Anglican religion was welcoming to science and to liberty, with the Scriptures open to all, while its toleration permitted a religious freedom evinced in the lack of censorship. It was very much the same encomium of the positive qualities of the Church of England that eighteenth-century churchmen had also used to uphold the pre-eminence of their church as the best of all possible churches. This attitude was now doing service in support of Anglicanism’s leading role in upholding Britain’s unique purpose as a Christian nation and imperial power. Consequently, concluded Luxmore (identifying the nation with the Church of England), ‘on our nation is bestowed a manifest superiority in point of religious knowledge . . . [like] the pre-eminence which we bear in point of extended commerce. Thus elevated and thus endowed, Britain may become the light of the world, the salt of the earth.’71
 For John Jenkinson of St Davids a decade later, living in a nation pre-eminent for its wealth and standard of living also meant it would be a reproach if Christian mission were not supported. This was, after all, the will of God, which Britain’s advantages required her to accede to. Her international commerce, and the Church of England’s position as the purest of all Protestant Churches in its apostolic 76 Law, Sermon, 17–18. 77 Howley, Sermon, 8. 78 Ryder, Sermon, 33–4.
 He also used the commercial theology of British spiritual things being oVered in exchange for temporal increase from the colonies, claiming: ‘we derive through them wealth and inXuence of no ordin- ary magnitude, and in this way our gratitude to the Giver of all good is best to be shown.’81
 These preachers’ emphasis on a national obligation to evangelize the empire was probably a reaction to an oYcial opposition to the evangelization of indigenous peoples in the new empire, lest this create an inferior ‘mongrel’ race that would be culturally divorced from its indigenous ancestors but would have dubious loyalty to Britain.82 Consequently, there was an uneasy compromise after 1790. Anglicanism was actively and oYcially supported in the empire, but only among British settler populations or among people already Christian; while for non-Christians the boosted support for the Church of England in the colonies during this period was to be impressive evidence of the national piety of the imperial power.83
 But, if the SPG sermons during the mid-point of this revived oYcial Anglicanism are any indication, within British imperialism it appears that Anglican leaders in England were chaWng against the conWning 79 Jenkinson, Sermon, 13–17. 80 Gray, Sermon, 17. 81 Hugh Percy, Bishop of Carlisle, A Sermon (1831), 9–12. 82 Bayly, Imperial Meridian, 101–9. 83 Ibid.
 of that policy to British settlers and residents. Both Evangelical and non-Evangelical bishops by this period were among those promoting the idea of a national mission to India—beyond the British, to the Indians themselves. Evangelization continued to be for Anglicans a Christian obligation placed upon Christian Britain in her empire, just as it had been viewed previously in regard to North America.
 However, this call for an evangelistic national mission in India by Anglicans was overshadowed during the wars with France by Anglican and government concerns about the impact of the French Revolution. The emphasis of the SPG preachers during this period on the link between the nation and its church and mission were, in this imperial context, a mirror of the Church of England’s domes- tic response to the French Revolution. In both colonial and domestic contexts Anglican bishops saw themselves and their clergy as promoting the church as a vehicle of a national mission designed to avoid the social, political, and religious disasters of revolutionary France. At home and in the empire the Church of England understood itself as the moderator of social divisions, and as the embodiment of the Christian faith that kept British society together.
 So the French Revolution prompted a decade of self-examination by the Church of England, as much as by the propertied and ruling orders, out of which emerged a consensus that the ruling orders were wanting in moral and social leadership. If this was not reversed, it was thought such a vacuum by society’s natural leaders could lead to a similar social revolution in Britain as had happened in France.
 Consequently, the bishops and leading Anglican clergy and laity, such as William Wilberforce, recalled the nation to a renewed eVort to minister to the needs of the country and to a revitalized connec- tion between church and state as a religious remedy to possible social upheaval. For the bishops, continued parliamentary support for the Church of England was a prerequisite for it to continue this mission to the nation of fostering social peace and unity.85
 It is clear from this investigation that Anglican domestic social policy spilled over—for SPG Anglican leaders at least—into the imperial arena. So SPG preachers advocated the imperial export of Anglican Christianity and church structure on the basis that it was a means of securing imperial unity and social order, virtues required abroad as they were at home. Continuously concerned about the possible extension of revolutionary social upheaval from nearby France, English metropolitan elites during this period were there- fore more comfortable with an Anglicanism led at home and in the empire by politically acceptable bishops rather than enthusiastic Evangelicals. Around the turn of the century the key Wgure was Bishop Porteus of London, whose views about mitigating the polit- ical disabilities of Dissent and Catholicism Wtted the assimilationist views of the prime minister, William Pitt, the governor general of India, RichardWellesley (LordMornington), and the president of the board of control, Henry Dundas.86 All three aYrmed the moral change necessary in society to see oV French Jacobinism, and that domestic political radicalism would be Wltered through the social conformism and conservatism of the Church of England.
 Consequently, that church was to be promoted imperially—Wrst, to strengthen the Christian witness of Britain abroad, and second, 85 Richard Allan Soloway, Prelates and People: Ecclesiastical Social Thought in England, 1783–1852 (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1969), 21–50. 86 Bayly, Imperial Meridian, 253.
 The political elite at home favoured a splendid and high-proWle Anglicanism in the colonies, not to convert the indigenous popula- tions but to impress them into conformity and docility.87 As a result, despite SPG episcopal preachers urging the evangelization of Indians, in reality Anglican eVorts in the East at this time concentrated on the English abroad and on existing non-Anglican Christian communi- ties. This remained the accepted purpose of the SPG as the oYcial missionary arm of the Church of England during most of this period, so that it preferred in 1820 to send clergy to be staV of Bishop’s College; only subsequently did they undertake direct evangelistic missions to Indians.
 Consequently, ‘the British nation, in return for its former crimes and mismanagement, may be made the instrument in the diVusion of both civil and religious happiness over the fairest portion of the globe.’98 He also wanted to extend Christianity so that India, like Britain, would enjoy the consequent moral and social beneWts. So he proposed an Anglican church establishment there as a permeating inXuence for improving British rule.
 Nor were these preachers futile in their eVorts to drum up support for religion and for their established church, for there is much evidence that the political elite of Britain in this period embraced religion, and particularly, if not monopolistically, the Church of England as part of their bulwark against the pernicious inXuence of revolutionary France. The landed rulers of Britain and their government were only too well aware that the sway of revolutionary ideology needed an ideological counter-attack. Viewing ideas of the Rights of Man and revolutionary liberty, equality, and fraternity as seriously seditious, they turned increasingly to religion as a bulwark for the status quo, especially after the Terror in 1793–4. They especially valued the work of Anglican apologists who emphasized the need of the church in society as a means of inculcating ethics grounded in eternal reward and punishment.100 While political favour was not conWned to the Church of England in this period— the equally established Church of Scotland, for example, receiving a parliamentary grant in 1808 to build more churches—that church was more favoured than others. From the point of view of the forces of the existing political and social order there were not many alter- natives, with Dissent tainted at the time by its history of freethinking and early Xirtation with the ideals of the French Revolution. While Anglicans, like Dissenters, also qualiWed patriotism by Christian allegiance and conscience, they were more whole-hearted in their 99 Ibid., 417–18. 100 Thomas Philip SchoWeld, ‘Conservative Political Thought in Britain in Response to the French Revolution’, Historical Journal, 29 (1986), 601–7.
 nationalism, and the clergy had been growing steadily more aligned with normal eighteenth-century Anglican theology during the 1780s and 1790s in defence of the established church’s position against the attacks of Old and New Dissent.101 Additionally, many signiWcant Wgures in church and state were part of an orthodox Anglican culture that Xourished—even after the demise of the Tory party in the 1760s—to become very inXuential in this period with their funda- mental attachment to the cause of the Church of England. These embraced conservative Whigs and politicians such as Charles Jenkinsson, Lord Rockingham, Edmund Burke; and High Church- men such as Lord MansWeld, Samuel Johnson, Bishop Horne, and the individuals in the succeeding generation who made up the High Church Hackney Phalanx.102
 Therefore, contemporary political circumstances made it feasible in this period for Anglicans to re-emphasize the importance of the connection between church and state. In doing so they were uphold- ing normative Anglican political theory as it had developed since the sixteenth century—the idea that the political nation, because it was Christian, should have a religious will and purpose. In this campaign for a renewed establishment Henry Majendie, the Bishop of Chester, led oV the batting in the nineteenth century on this far from sticky wicket, conWdent that Anglican calls for a revitalized church–state alliance to have an imperial dimension would now have a willing audience among the English political elites. It was very satisfying, the bishop maintained in his sermon of 1804, that at a time of great diYculty in the defence of the country Parliament should have strengthened the established church, which would, undoubtedly, 101 William StaVord, ‘Religion and the Doctrine of Nationalism in England at the Time of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars’, in Stuart Mews (ed.), Religion and National Identity (Studies in Church History, vol. 18) (Oxford: Blackwell, 1982), 382–95. 102 James J. Sack, From Jacobite to Conservative: Reaction and Orthodoxy in Britain, c.1760–1832 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), 37, 39, 49, 75–6, 78, 201, 255.

 induce divine favour towards Britain. The legislative boost for the Church of England the bishop was referring to was probably the uniting in 1801 of the Church of Ireland with the Church of England into the legal union known as the United Church of England and Ireland. He clearly hoped that Parliament would look equally favour- ably upon the imperial mission of the SPG. The society was the best qualiWed to disseminate Christianity and ‘the Apostolic Discipline of the Church of England’ throughout the British colonies. Such par- liamentary measures were likely to conciliate the favour of God towards the nation at a time of severe trials.103 A decade later, Majendie’s successor as Bishop of Chester, George Law, also drew attention to the imperial importance of the alliance between church and state. He stressed the advantages that arose from the union in terms of sanctions for uniformity of doctrine for the church, and social morality for the state against the deadly liberality characterized by contemporary, but dangerous, liberal tolerance towards other forms of government and religion. Such ‘salutary restraints’ had checked in Britain the contagion of the French Revolution. The best solution for the continued peaceableness of British society was, not surprisingly, to demand that Christian ministry be properly qualiWed by its learning and that Christianity at home and abroad would best be fostered by the established church.104
 On the basis of the reinvigorated support of the British state for its largest established church, the SPG preachers sought to focus this alliance in the empire on achieving an Anglican establishment in India. It was the same goal that SPG Anglicans had pressed for in the eighteenth century in respect to the North American colonies. But in the early nineteenth century, with new political interest in strengthen- ing the Church of England, it seemed success was more likely. Bishops Thurlow and Cleaver had already suggested the possibility in the 1780s and 1790s, and SPG preachers made the most of their annual celebra- tion to press this possibility publicly. It could, they suggested, be the foundation for evangelizing Indians and countering the degenerative inXuence of accruing wealth among the young men of the East India Company, whose riches could erode their religious duties and have a consequently corrosive eVect upon colonial government. The state 103 Majendie, Sermon, 20–1. 104 Law, Sermon, 12–15.
 needed to cooperate with the SPG, according to Bishop Majendie, for this salutary purpose.
 If motives of Policy determined our Rulers on the introduction of the British Code of Jurisprudence within our Asiatic Colonies,105 it may be hoped that the time is not far distant when, from higher Principles, a suYcient Religious Establishment will there be formed for our own Countrymen.106
 Many successive sermons contained episcopal urgings for govern- ment to inaugurate an Anglican establishment in India. Bishop Dampier of Rochester in 1806 took up the cudgels. He spoke of the ‘languishing state’ of religion in British Asian colonies, an assessment he based on his reading of the book by the company chaplain, Claudius Buchanan, whoseMemoir for the Expediency of an Ecclesias- tical Establishment for British India had been published the previous year. According to Dampier, for as long as religion was unsupported by the government in these colonies, British rule in India lacked a secure foundation, because it was religion that ‘compacted and bound together’ the colonial political union with England. This could have been corrected with the renewal of the company’s charter in 1793, but the religious establishment planned in that bill was defeated.107 The bishop pressed the point that British residents in India without religious guidance and resources were exposed to the corrosive eVects of local climate and culture. It was the theme of colonial dissipation with respect to colonists in eighteenth-century North America being reiterated for India. ‘It is with Christian feelings that we contemplate 105 The Regulating Act (1773) of the government of Lord North established a supreme court in Calcutta and a judiciary paid by the crown.

Bowen, ‘British India, 1765–1813: The Metropolitan Context’, in Marshall, Oxford History of the British Empire, vol. 2, 540. 106 Majendie, Sermon, 19. 107 The so-called ‘pious clauses’ of the 1793 charter were proposed by Wilberforce and would have required the East India Company to have provided schoolmasters and missionaries as well as chaplains. The proposals were defeated by opposition from company supporters and shareholders. Gibb, Anglican Church in India, 45–6. Despite Bishop Dampier’s comments, these proposals did not seem to have included an established episcopate in India.
 His colleague from Bristol, the next year, believed a church estab- lishment was necessary as Britain’s Eastern territorial possessions grew more extensive. It was a duty made urgent because of the unacceptable practices of Hindus such as infanticide and the suicide of widows. ‘How can we, as Christians,’ the bishop asked, ‘justify it to ourselves, not to instil into them the mild precepts and the social duties of Christianity, and thereby rescue them from their religious self-delusion?’111 In 1808 the Bishop of St David’s complained that it was left to too few Protestant missionaries to fulWl the great duty that rested upon Britain because of its territorial possessions there. Par- ticularly, British settlements, like the Portuguese before them, should have the beneWts of a properly constituted church establishment.112
 The SPG preachers wanted a church establishment consisting of a legally constituted episcopate—that is, one founded by an act of Parliament—debate about which intensiWed around the renewal of the East India Company’s charter by Parliament in 1813. The major protagonists in the debate in Britain over the conditions of the charter included the orientalists—largely present and former company oYcials—who wished to reduce any British intrusion into Indian culture and religion to a bare minimum; any more, they 108 Thomas Dampier, Bishop of Rochester, A Sermon (1806), 16. 109 Ibid., 17–18. 110 Ibid., 20. 111 Pelham, Sermon, 12–14. 112 Burgess, Sermon, 11–12.
 To what degree Evangelicals and non-Evangelicals in the Church of England were responsible for the oYcial change of heart embodied in the 1813 charter is not in the purview of this work. Given that SPG bishops had been raising the issue publicly in sermons since the mid- 1780s it is not surprising that the SPG had an East India committee for the purpose, and that this group and the SPCK had discussions about lobbying government with the Archbishop of Canterbury and other High Churchmen on the basis of Claudius Buchanan’s pro- posals.115 However, similarities and contrasts between the SPG and those Evangelicals in the Church of England who were also interested in the expansion of Christianity in British India do require attention 113 David Kopf, British Orientalism and the Bengal Renaissance: The Dynamics of Indian Modernization, 1773–1835 (Calcutta: Mukhopadhyay, 1969), 133–44; Spear, India, 121–3. 114 Brian Gardner, The East India Company: A History (London: Hart-Davis, 1971), 171. 115 Andrew Porter, Religion versus Empire?

 here, as forming part of the spectrum of metropolitan and colonial Anglican attitudes to empire in this period.
 But these orientalist Anglicans were, by and large, individuals within a larger lobby group that was not predominantly inXuenced by Anglicanism but by other factors, such as Utilitarianism among the humanitarians, or the company’s interests, or Enlightenment intellectualism among the orientalists. Among the recognizable groupings of British attitudes towards India in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the predominant Anglican ones were the Evangelicals and those non-Evangelical ‘Orthodox’121 associated with the SPG and the SPCK.
 So what then of Evangelical Anglican attitudes towards Britain’s imperial purpose in India? Of all Anglican groups interested in empire, these have undoubtedly been the most studied by historians, often by those of an Evangelical persuasion themselves.122 Their 118 Sudipta Sen, Distant Sovereignty: National Imperialism and the Origins of British India (London: Routledge, 2002), 49. 119 Ibid., 53. 120 Ibid., 53–4. 121 ‘Orthodox’ was the preferred self-description of the non-Evangelical High Churchmen in the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Nockles, Oxford Movement in Context, 25–32. 122 Most notably, Ian Bradley, The Call to Seriousness: The Evangelical Impact on the Victorians (London: Jonathan Cape, 1976); Stuart Piggin, Making Evangelical assessment of the Evangelicals as the most inXuential of the Anglican groupings concerned with India at this time was also reXective of the judgement of earlier, secular historians.123 By the early nineteenth century missionary Anglicans of the SPG had been joined by activists of the emerging Evangelical party in the Church of England, and by a growing number of colonial Anglicans throughout the nineteenth century. In this period among Evangelical Anglicans in England, William Wilberforce and Charles Grant were pre-eminent. They, in turn, were associated with the views of the leading Evangelical publicist on India, Claudius Buchanan, whom Grant had appointed as a company chaplain in India.124 Wilberforce became involved in the Evangelical agitation for open access for missionaries to India during the parliamentary debates over the renewal of the company’s charter in 1793 and, when that failed, again in 1813. But his infor- mation and his outlook on India were probably moulded by Grant’s greater experience and knowledge of the subcontinent.125 Given that these two shared a common religious viewpoint, Wilberforce would have been sympathetic to Grant’s Indian outlook. So in their common political involvement Wilberforce acted as a political front in the House of Commons for an increasingly organized Evan- gelical campaign on India. Charles Grant acted as the leading Evangelical proponent of missions within the company itself.
 Both, in turn, were assisted by the publicity created for missions by Buchanan.126 The public views of these three leading Evangelical protagonists, therefore, are the Wrst major source used here to indi- cate the major characteristics of the Evangelical Anglican imperial view of India during this period.
 of Indians. At the core of this dual purpose for Buchanan were two requisite policies: an Anglican Church establishment for the former, and missions to eVect the latter.
 Buchanan, surprisingly, found historical precedent for the twin thrusts of his proposal in Roman Catholic missions in India, point- ing to their success as an indicator of what would await British eVorts. He considered that, generally speaking, these missions had both preserved the faith of Catholic Europeans and Indians, as well as being a civilizing inXuence in the subcontinent. As this was precisely what he hoped for from greater British missionary eVort, it suited his purposes to draw attention to how Roman Catholic missions had set a historical precedent for this agenda and ‘dispelled much of the darkness of Paganism’, notwithstanding Catholicism’s ‘constitutional asperity, intolerant and repulsive, compared with the generous prin- ciples of the Protestant religion’.140
 Therefore, emulating the Roman Catholic precedent, he wanted an Anglican episcopal establishment in India, with four bishops: one in each of the principalities of Madras and Bombay; an arch- bishop in Calcutta; and a bishop in Ceylon for the islands of the Indian and PaciWc Oceans and Australia. He castigated British neglect of such a foundation in its Indian territories as representing 138 Buchanan, Memoir, xii. 139 William Wilberforce to Richard Wellesley, 1799; quoted in Bearce, British Attitudes, 40. 140 Buchanan, Memoir, 8.
 Britain was unique among European imperial powers in not fostering the Christian religion as a remedy for potential social and religious decline among its own citizens in colonial territories, so that British administrators who came out to England as mere youths quickly succumbed, he believed, to the dissolute temptations of Indian society.144 It was the lack of religious instructors for these scions of empire that created the colonial moral vacuum into which they readily fell, having no alternative. So accustomed had the British become to this dearth of religion that the cultural degeneracy which he characterized as ‘that illicit native connection’ was ‘ren- dered not disreputable’.145 His views concerning this British cultural 141 Buchanan, Memoir, 12. 142 Ibid., 13. 143 Ibid., 3. 144 Ibid., 16. 145 Ibid., 17.
 The implication being, that if Britain continued in India to support Hinduism and neglect the extension of Christianity then the Provi- dence that governed the rise and fall of empires would remove its empire from Britain.
 While Grant, Buchanan and, to a lesser extent, Wilberforce, were foundational in shaping Evangelical Anglican attitudes to India, these views were further entrenched by those of the CMS Parent Committee in London, the local Calcutta Corresponding Commit- tee, and also by edited published versions of the reports of CMS missionaries engaged in actual contact with Bengalis. These Evangel- ical sources reveal a construction of India remarkably similar to that of the SPG. God and the British Empire continued to be linked in a mutually beneWcial partnership. Commenting upon the growth of mission schools as a means of disseminating Truth and Christian principles, the Calcutta Corresponding Committee of the CMS maintained that to hinder this development would be ‘a disgrace to this nation’. The schools provided knowledge that enhanced the ‘stability and perpetuity of the Empire’; it was also a duty of Britain as a Christian nation. ‘India is entrusted to our charge; and a fearful responsibility awaits us, as a nation, if we prove unfaithful to that trust. IndiVerence or hostility to wise and benevolent attempts to win her to the Faith, bespeak an utter absence of both good political wisdom and of Christian Feeling.’160 The implication here that this evangelistic responsibility fell upon the British in their empire because it was entrusted to them by God was made more explicit by the prayers at a London public meeting of the parent committee in 1826, where God was asked to pardon the British for their evangel- istic shortcomings, despite these being the basis upon which they had been divinely permitted to acquire their empire.
 This binding duty fell upon Britain because, Wrst, she possessed a large proportion of gospel truth. Second, she possessed a large proportion of the heathen world. Third, she had the wealth to fulWl her Divine Commission. ‘England is appointed, at this eventful period, the distinguished oYce of furthering, as an honoured instru- ment in the hand of Providence, the Evangelization of the Heathen World.’ While a similar undertaking fell also upon the ‘Protestant Church’, the ‘Protestant Maritime Nations’, and ‘Protestant America’, Britain’s imperial circumstances gave her a ‘peculiar responsibility’.
 But these Evangelical Anglican imperial viewpoints were not new.
 We have encountered such views before, both in the SPG colonial reports and metropolitan sermons constructing an understanding of their mission to North America in the eighteenth century, and in the society’s preachers concerned with India that were examined earlier in this chapter. Clearly, the eighteenth-century SPG preachers predate the formation of Evangelical Anglican views of the British Empire. From the beginning of the eighteenth century SPG mission- aries and metropolitan preachers had also constructed a view of the empire as a providential and a benevolent development for Britain and her colonies. They too delineated a world of theological polar- ities between European Christian light and the heathen New World darkness. For them also it was a bipolar world that equated to a radical diVerence between civilization and barbarity or, at least, moral degeneracy, that prompted them to believe in a civilizing mission for Britain and her church in addition to an evangelistic one. Both the earlier SPG Anglicans and the later Evangelicals were concerned about the religious degeneracy of British residents in the 182 Missionary Register, November 1820, 120–1. 183 J. Obelkevich, Religion and Rural Society: South Lindsey, 1825–1875 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1976), 259–312.
 colonies, and to advocate the establishment of an episcopal structure and government support for it as its remedy. Both were equally convinced that Anglican evangelism among the heathen in their imperial territories was a requirement of their faith, and necessary because of the unique divine truth of Christianity in contrast to heathen error, a view of indigenous peoples that was commonplace among European Christians.184 There can even be found among the Evangelicals examined here an echo of the eighteenth-century com- mercial theology of missions identiWed in the North American period of Anglican missionary concern. Buchanan expressed this theology of spiritual returns by Britain traded for the material wealth that Britain received from her Indian colony in two passages in hisMemoir.
 So both the older Orthodox Anglicans of the SPG,187 and the newer Evangelical Anglicans, were formulating very similar theologies and 184 For example, the same view was held by the great Lutheran missionary employed by the SPCK, Bartholomew Zeigenbald, at the commencement of his nearly twenty-three years in India, which began in 1706. Though he never changed his views of Hinduism as a superstitious religion without salviWc eVect, he did come to appreciate India as a great civilization. Neill, Christianity in India, 32. 185 Buchanan, Memoir, 38. 186 Ibid., 74. 187 The SPG preachers, being bishops and deans, did not encompass Evangel- icals among their number until the last decade of the eighteenth century, when views of British imperialism. The major diVerence between them did not lie in their attitudes or beliefs about the empire and British responsibilities towards it, or in their respective construction of indi- genous and colonial identities in those colonized territories, but rather in their modes of acting on that Anglican imperial world view. But it was not simply a matter of the Evangelicals being more willing to act on their (evangelistic) beliefs about empire and mission than the SPG.
 This is the view of Alan Davidson, who argues that the SPG preachers were largely disengaged from any active interest in missions in the Weld, their sermons being largely ‘academic, armchair reXections’ devoid of any serious active concern to implement what they preached.
 Instead of an active evangelism, the SPG sermons, for Davidson, ‘reXected a latitudinarian ethos which applauded past achievements but did nothing to initiate new action’.188 This is a serious criticism and would certainly apply to a number of the preachers, but not to all.
 Davidson’s criticism also reXects a later nineteenth-century div- ision that became drawn between High Church and Evangelical Anglicans. As reXected in their similar attitudes to the empire and their common arguments for its Christianization, the Church of England in the period before 1832 was relatively united in compari- son with the internal partisan hostility that emerged after the rise of the Tractarians in the 1830s.189 What was diVerent between Evangel- icals and Orthodox Anglicans with respect to the British colonies was the type and organization of their activism in pursuit of results for a common Anglican understanding of empire. The SPG and its Evangelicals began to enter the higher ranks of the Anglican clergy. In addition, some SPG missionaries in the early nineteenth century were Evangelicals.

 supporters throughout the period under review in this chapter remained wedded to the style of agitation suited to the eighteenth century, whereas Evangelical activism was, by the early nineteenth century, more contemporary, and publicly organized in pursuit of its goals. Both used voluntary societies, but the SPG relied on patronage and personal inXuence, and looked to inXuential links with govern- ment in quest of its imperial Christian purposes and its Shangri-la of a colonial episcopate, whereas the Evangelicals were willing to lobby publicly through an organized national network of supporters, to coordinate petitions to Parliament, and to generate publicity such as Buchanan’s Memoir. By their tactics in the 1813 EIC charter debate, Evangelicals were already incipiently working in the organized way that was indicative of the national party they would consciously become in the later nineteenth century. It is not that one group of Anglicans was putting words into action, whereas the other was not; it is rather that the action taken by the SPG over its missions and its concern for an Anglican episcopate in India persisted with an older eighteenth-century style of patronage activism, while Evangelical support for the same ends was one that foreshadowed nineteenth- century organized religious activity.190
 The eventual government establishment of Anglicanism in India as part of the 1813 renewal of the company’s charter was, initially, far less than the Evangelical constituency and the SPG and SPCK had hoped for.191 Instead of three or four dioceses, only one was inaug- urated. However, for the Wrst time in India, Britain, through the East India Company, legally and Wnancially provided for an Anglican establishment in the appointment of a Bishop of Calcutta, and an archdeacon in each of the three presidencies of Calcutta, Madras, and 190 For eighteenth-century society as a world of vertical relationships which, for elite inXuence, required access to aristocratic clientage and patronage, see Paul Langford, A Polite and Commercial People: England, 1727–1783 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989), 595–600; and in a more speciWcally ecclesiastical context JeVrey Cham- berlain, Accommodating High Churchmen: The Clergy of Sussex, 1700–1745 (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1997), 68–79. 191 The general meeting of the SPCK, inXuenced by Buchanan’s work, passed a resolution in June 1813 in which it expressed its desire for the foundation of dioceses in each of the three company presidencies, as well as churches and seminaries. Davidson, Evangelicals and Attitudes to India, 231–2.
 Bombay. The extension of the episcopate to all three presidencies was not brought about until the 1833 charter renewal.192
 From 1814, having Wnally had an Anglican episcopal structure approved for India, the SPG preachers began to formulate an under- standing of the role and purpose of that structure in their eastern outpost. They continued to do this until the mid-1820s. The year after Parliament enacted this colonial episcopate the Bishop of Ely eschewed its foundation as being any sort of bridgehead of coercive conversion for Indians. Rather, it was part of an amalgam of meas- ures to support the Church of England in that part of the world, including the encouragement of education and the dispersion of the Bible. Demonstrating how much these early nineteenth-century SPG preachers were still part of an eighteenth-century culture, he used a classic Anglican metaphor to describe the relationship between throne and altar by aYrming that the measure entitled the king to be truly ‘ ‘‘the nursing father’’ of a Christian Church throughout his Oriental Empire’.193 Three years later, Bishop Howley of London had his say on the matter. He regarded the development as one of ‘peculiar importance’ in restoring the Church of England in India to its ‘integrity of form and legitimate honours’, and therefore her inXuence in British India, and as a ‘centre of union’ for all religious persons there to act in accordance with each other.194 In 1819 the Bishop of Gloucester believed that the Anglican establishment repre- sented Parliament sanctioning the promulgation of Christianity in India through the ‘safest and most wholesome channels’. He blithely envisaged the growth of an Indian Anglicanism of both British and Indians in the new structure, which would provide ‘a regular form of Church Government for European residents, and surely by anticipa- tion for the whole community of native converts’.195 For Herbert Marsh of Peterborough two years afterwards the episcopal establish- ment was necessary for the supervision of missionaries in India, so as to induce the uniformity of faith and worship essential, he thought, for successful evangelism. ‘The diVerence in the opinions maintained 192 Neill, Christianity in India, 261, 176. 193 Sparke, Sermon, 17; Nockles, Oxford Movement in Context, 58. 194 Howley, Sermon, 24. 195 Ryder, Sermon, 19.
 by the various parties of professing Christians . . . is deeply to be deplored . . . The very circumstances that Christianity is presented to them [the heathen] under diVerent forms, cannot fail to prepos- sess them against Christianity itself.’196 William Van Mildert, the young but rising High Church Bishop of LlandaV preaching in 1822, was gratiWed to know that the Indian establishment meant that the legal and constitutional ascendancy of the Church of Eng- land, which was so necessary for the general good of society, was also taking root in India. This, coupled with the exemplary character of the then-present Bishop of Calcutta,197 would, no doubt, improve the moral character of the British in India and, consequently, the estimation of the British in the eyes of the Indians, ‘whom we are desirous of reconciling to the Christian persuasion’.198
 SPG metropolitan Anglicans saw the Indian episcopal establish- ment as being the national conWrmation of Anglican metropolitan religious superiority in a colonial setting. It was, they felt, a starting point for the organization of British Christianity in India through the Church of England as being clearly favoured by the state and self- consciously addressing its own imperial responsibilities. The empire, they fondly hoped from this mark of political favour, would now develop as an Anglican as well as a British one. SPG Anglicans in this period of a resurgent imperialism continued to base their imperial plans on continued state support, a hope that seemed well-founded in the years after 1813. A new era in the history of Bengal had begun, aYrmed the Bishop of Bristol in 1823, which would overcome the obstacles in the way of ‘the communication of Christianity to our Eastern Empire’.199 William Carey of Exeter also saw the establish- ment of the diocese of Calcutta as an important watershed. It fos- tered the faith of Anglicans there, and the more eVectual promotion of Christianity to Hindus, but also exempliWed to the world the fact that there was a renewed interest in religion in Britain. Among Anglicans it demonstrated an ‘ardent desire’ for the evangelism of the empire. This evangelism, he aYrmed, needed to channel itself 196 Marsh, Sermon, 12–13. 197 Richard Heber, second Bishop of Calcutta, 1822–6. 198 William Van Mildert, Bishop of LlandaV, A Sermon (1822), 33–5. 199 Kaye, Sermon, 25.
 into ‘one uniform and systematic plan’—that is, an Anglican one— rather than the present situation of ‘irregular and unconnected eVorts’.200 The bishop may have had in mind the diYculties the Bishops of Calcutta and the CMS were experiencing in uniting their missionary and diocesan eVorts into a single Anglican frame- work; or, possibly, given the hostility towards Dissent in this period, he was criticizing the Dissenting Protestant missionary societies operating in India.201 The next year the Bishop of Gloucester ex- pressed similar sentiments about Eastern missions having an overall coherence of design and purpose, so that ‘idolators’ could clearly see a visible church, ‘well-disciplined and well-compacted, at unity with itself, upholding its dignity and maintaining harmony and good order among its members’; towards the accomplishment of which desideratum the establishment of colonial episcopal sees was a satis- fying step.202
 Once SPG clergy were actually in India they, along with successive Bishops of Calcutta in their reports to the society, more or less repeated in their Anglican construction of India what their prede- cessors at the centre and the North American colonial peripheries of empire had formulated in the previous century. They conceived of this engagement as a natural part of the national mission in the on- going partnership between church and state. Writing to the society in 1818, Bishop Middleton looked forward to cooperation with the society and the SPCK in such a manner as to give his mission the ‘character of a national eVort to disseminate in these regions our Holy Faith in its purest form’.203 It was part of the providential plan to spread Christianity in its purest reality—the Church of England— through the agency of the British Christian state.
 Our power is now established throughout this vast Peninsula in a degree, which but a few years since the most sanguine did not contemplate: civil- ization and religion may be expected in the ordinary course of Providence to follow the successes of a Christian state; and in every view, religious or 200 William Carey, Bishop of Exeter, A Sermon (1824), 11–13. 201 Gibbs, Anglican Church in India, 71–4, 121–5.

 But unlike his eighteenth-century predecessors, the bishop had no complaints about the level of state support, praising the liberality and favour of the governor, the Marquess of Hastings, and his colonial government in the development of the projected Bishop’s College.205
 Christian had, said Heber, apprehended ‘that the bustle and parade attending an oYcial progress would interfere with his means of 204 Ibid., 94. 205 SPG, Proceedings (1821), 141. 206 Letter, Revd Mill to SPG, Ajmeer, 29 July 1822, ibid. (1822), 197–8.
 One feature of the old North American engagement with empire that still Wgured in this Indian one, at least from one of the society’s prominent High Churchmen, was a traditional hostility between Dissent and the church. Principal Mill of Bishop’s College believed he encountered opposition to the established church from Dissent- ing missionaries. He recognized Dissenting evangelism among the Indians as good work, the Baptists especially, but felt this was undone by the ‘evil’ of their antagonism to the church as established, which prevailed among them. It arose, he believed, out of ‘the original evil of their separation’. The propagation of this anti-establishment view by the Dissenters he saw as a threat to the planting of the church in India.208
 It seems that in these initial years of the Anglican missions to India, actual encounters with the Indian population hardly budged the theological construction of Indian identity that had already been formulated. This was probably because most of these colonial reporters were still themselves largely metropolitan in their cultural and religious outlooks. Bishop Middleton of Calcutta, who was forty-Wve years old when he arrived in Calcutta, in 1818 saw an almost ontological diVerence between the European and the Indian, their mindsets having little or no points of contact, the European being that of a mature adult and the Indian that of a child. ‘The task [of conversion] is much the same as that of a man, who in the full maturity of understanding and knowledge should endeavour to divest himself of these, and to think as a child.’214
 However, it is clear that Anglicans did not have only an evangel- istic motive in their educational agenda, which also included a European reconstruction of Indian personality and culture. The comments of the Revd Thomason on his return from a visit to Agra with the governor general were summarized by the Missionary Register as, ‘even the good, the very best Natives, do not obtain the 215 Missionary Register, June 1819, 271. 216 Ibid., November 1822, 481–2. 217 Ibid., 482–3. 218 Ibid., April 1825, 193.
 He went on, in an Enlightenment paradigm, to propose that the diVusion of European knowledge oVered ‘improvement’, because 230 Ibid., August 1827, 384. 231 Bishop of Calcutta to SPG, 16 November 1818, SPG, Proceedings (1818), 87.

 Predictably, caste emerged as a major issue for the SPG missions once they moved beyond the project of Bishop’s College in the 1820s.
 At the end of the period of renewed church–state partnership in the British Empire, the word from missionaries in India showed almost as little understanding of the diVerent, sophisticated, and satisfying cultures of India as it had at the beginning. The 1829

 Looking beyond India, the most extensive metropolitan examin- ation by any of the bishops in this period of the relation between the Church of England and the state with regard to the empire was towards its end, in 1827 by Charles BlomWeld, Bishop of Chester, who later became Bishop of London and the driving force behind the ecclesiastical commission established by the new Whig government in 1835 to reorganize the Church of England. He criticized the state for not being more proactive concerning religious provision during the previous century. The Wrst duty of every government, BlomWeld asserted, was the maintenance and promotion of Christianity for, ultimately, it was the degree to which a country was subservient to God’s eternal purposes that was its Wnal guarantee of stability.
 However, while religious provision for subjects in colonies was a responsibility of a metropolitan Christian government, provision for the conversion of unbelievers rested with the colonial author- ities.250 Like so many of his predecessors, BlomWeld was setting earthly politics under divine dominion, and espousing the trad- itional Christian belief that it was the purpose of the former to serve the latter. He used the Scripture text ‘freely ye have received; freely give’ to also uphold the theology of exchange of his SPG predecessors. Britain had received many blessings. She had early received the gospel; her Protestant truth had been sustained by a series of historic deliverances; and she had acquired an unexpectedly vast empire and a continually extending commerce, all of which justiWed the old Anglican providential view that English history 249 Ibid. (1829), 55. 250 BlomWeld, Sermon, 11.
 had been so ordered by God because the nation had a singular role to play in the divine plan. Yet Britain was in danger of being condemned by God for lukewarmness and sloth in carrying out its divine pur- pose. True, she had been active in war and trade but, BlomWeld asked, ‘is the acquisition of territory in heathen lands to be the ultimate object of conquest to a nation of believers? Shall the acquisition of riches be the highest praise and noblest recompense of commercial enterprise to Christian merchants?’251 The success of both British merchants and British armies in India meant that Britain had an opportunity of carrying out God’s purposes there. ‘May that oppor- tunity be improved’, BlomWeld concluded forcefully.252 He consid- ered the bishopric of Calcutta to be a major development towards British Christianity earning respect in the East, because the Church of England thereby became a recognized part of the system of British government in India, with the authority of that rule behind it, in contrast to the marginality of a few chaplains employed by a private trading company. Alluding to this oYcial authority and to the model of primitive Christianity that Anglicans of the era believed their church to uphold, BlomWeld asserted: ‘Christianity was not likely to make a decided and powerful impression upon the people of that country, till it appeared amongst them in the perfectness and lustre of an Apostolical Church, revered and obeyed by the conquerors of the eastern world.’253
 As was the case with the earlier metropolitan discourse on slavery in the SPG plantations, colonial actuality and Anglican rhetoric were not necessarily a mirror of one another. In fact, the new Anglican establishment in India remained too dependent on the British im- perial system to become the base for Indian evangelism envisaged by its original Anglican supporters.254 The distinction between the truth on the ground and the understanding at the centre of the empire points out how little diVerent in this period was input from the colonial periphery from that of the metropolitan centre of Anglican- ism. In part, this may have had to do with the division between the Indian establishment and the most substantial Anglican missionary society then in India, the CMS, which both parties were unable to 251 BlomWeld, Sermon, 13. 252 Ibid., 20. 253 Ibid., 16. 254 Neil, Christianity in India, 275.
 easily overcome despite sincere eVorts. It may also have indicated how little at this stage of Anglican colonial history the new, under- resourced Indian episcopate could inXuence its metropolitan back- ers into revising their discourse according to Anglican colonial experience. But most of all it was because those Anglicans reporting on India and Indians from the colonial periphery shared the same religious presuppositions as those they reported to at the centre. Essentially, these colonial Anglicans, Evangelicals or non- Evangelicals, interpreted their experience through predetermined theological eyes.
 It could provide an imperial religious bond that would stabilize and unite the peoples of the empire with Britain, just as that church provided the same peace and stability to England. Imperial unity could be achieved not merely by evangelism but particularly through the establishment of an Anglican state-backed episcopal structure, in India and elsewhere in the empire.
 These Anglican explicators of empire were not defending a ‘reac- tionary’, ‘pre-modern’ ‘obscurantist’, or ‘illiberal’ view of Britain and her society by these views. The Anglican churchmen who upheld it were often involved in many of the contemporary developments of science and thought.255 Rather than an ‘old-fashioned’ view, these Anglicans were expressing an accepted and acceptable orthodoxy that had prevailed in English elite religious, political, and social circles since the sixteenth century. It had been Wrst deWned by Richard Hooker, and defended in church and state ever since.256 The major motif of this Anglican political theology as applied to the empire was not focused on the monarchy, as J.C.D. Clark has found,257 but simply on England as a Christian state whose Christianity was epit- omized in the established Church of England, and whose empire, consequently, ought also to be Christian—and indeed, Anglican. The 255 For example, in the eighteenth century Bishop George Berkeley was involved in theories about perception as a philosopher and mathematician, and Bishop Gilbert Burnett was a historian. They included many who were leading or capable scholars, such as Joseph Butler. A number of these eighteenth-century Anglicans were also interested members of the Royal Society. 256 ‘By the Church . . . we understand no other than only the visible Church. For preservation of Christianity there is not any thing more needful, than such as are of the visible Church have mutual fellowship and society with one another. In which consideration, as the main body of the sea being one, yet within divers precincts hath divers names; so that Catholic Church is in like sort divided into a number of distinct Societies, every of which is termed a Church within itself. In this sense the Church is always a visible society of men; not an assembly, but a Society. For although the name of the Church be given unto Christian assemblies, although any multitude of Christian men congregated may be termed by the name of a Church, yet assemblies properly are rather things that belong to a Church. Men are assembled for perform- ance of public actions; which actions being ended, the assembly dissolveth itself and is no longer in being, whereas the Church which was assembled doth no less agree to continue afterwards than before. ‘‘Where but three are, and they of the laity also (saith Tertullian), yet there is a Church;’’ that is to say, a Christian assembly. But a Church, as now we are to understand it, is a Society; that is, a number of men belonging unto some Christian fellowship, that place and limits whereof are certain. That wherein they have communion is the public exercise of such duties as those mentioned in the Apostles’ Acts, ‘‘instruction, breaking of bread and prayer.’’ As therefore they that are of the mystical body of Christ have those inward graces and virtues, whereby they diVer from all others, which are not of the same body; again, whosoever appertain the visible body of the Church, they have also the notes of external profession, whereby the world knoweth what they are: after the same manner even the several societies of Christian men, unto every of which the name of a Church is given in addition betokening severalty, and so the rest, must be endued with correspondent general properties belonging unto them as they are public Christian societies. And of such properties common unto all societies Christian, it may not be denied that one of the very chiefest is Ecclesiastical Polity . . . a form of ordering the public spiritual aVairs of the Church of God.’ (Richard Hooker, The Laws of Ecclesi- astical Polity, Book III, ch. 1, #14.) 257 Clark, English Society, 256–62.
 longevity and dominance of this Anglican political theology accounts for the remarkable similarity between the Anglican discourse relating to American colonies in the Wrst British Empire, and that of the second empire that is often contrasted with it. Such continuities have been aYrmed before by imperial historians, but in non-religious areas such as economics and trade, pointing to the secular focus of most historians of the British Empire.258 In fact, both British Empires were understood similarly by these Anglicans because both discourses—that constructing the old empire from 1701–83, and the new after 1783—were framed during what is called ‘the long Eight- eenth Century’. This was the period from possibly as early as 1660, and certainly from 1688, when a hegemonic politico-religious-social culture prevailed that was based on Anglican orthodoxy.259 The remarkable similarity of imperial views between Evangelicals and High Churchmen in this period was also probably to do with the prevalence of an Anglican theology that was more common than is often thought, because Evangelicals also derived their political and social attitudes from the same Orthodox sources for which High Churchmen during this period were the most eVective and inXuen- tial spokesmen.260 Consequently, it seems likely that the focus of most historians of empire on the Evangelicals during this period may have distorted Anglican imperial inXuence by leaving the High Churchmen out of the picture, and the Evangelicals in sole posses- sion of the religious framing of an imperial discourse.261
 Whether that Anglican hegemony prevailed to such an extent that England during this period was a confessional Anglican state, as Jonathan Clark argues in great detail,262 is not as pertinent here as the fact that the Anglicans examined in this period so far spoke 258 P.J. Marshall, ‘First and Second British Empires: A Question of Demarcation’, History, 49 (1964), 13–23. 259 While there is disagreement around some of its constituent parts and its exact beginnings, there is now a signiWcant historical consensus that the period between 1660/88 and 1832 (the ‘long eighteenth century’) constituted a uniWed period of English–British culture and politics, which has been most controversially analysed by J.C.D. Clark in his English Society. 260 Ibid., 284–300, 301–2. 261 See for example, C.A. Bayly, who ascribes critical inXuence with regard to the empire to ‘establishment Evangelicals’. Bayly, Imperial Meridian, 143. 262 Clark, English Society, 26–34.
 publicly as if that confessional state existed. Anglicans of the SPG since 1701 up until the 1820s, joined towards the end of this period by Evangelicals, constructed an imperial dialogue as if England was an Anglican state, and therefore that the empire should be at least predominantly Anglican also. These churchmen were as aware as anyone else in this period that the English reality was neither an Anglican monopoly nor uniformity. However, they took for granted Anglican predominance and, in that context, regarded the fact of religious toleration in England as acceptable because it was contained within a society constitutionally committed to a religious orthodoxy that enshrined the social, political, and cultural hegemony of the Church of England, commonly referred to as the ‘Protestant Constitution’.263 As Clark has identiWed, Anglican churchmen in England tenaciously upheld this Protestant Constitution, primarily against Dissent during this period.264 Equally, this research demon- strates, they attempted to construct an understanding of the empire that upheld the export of this Anglican ascendancy to the colonies against the forces of colonial religious degeneracy, indigenous super- stition, idolatry, and heathenism—and sometimes, if they were High Churchmen, against the invasions of religious plurality in the form of Dissent, characterized as ‘enthusiasm’, into which they sometimes elided Evangelicalism. However, nothwithstanding greater sympathy for Dissent among Anglican Evangelicals, generally in this period there was no general Orthodox hostility towards their Evangelical co- religionists in the empire, for both espoused an imperial dominance of the Church of England expressed in their common agenda for an Anglican establishment in India.
 The major diVerence between the periods covered by these last two chapters, 1701–83 and 1783–1820s, is not, therefore, in the content of the Anglican discourse. The signiWcant change is that in the latter period the state gave greater support to the Church of England, both at home and abroad. So Anglican hopes of their church achieving an imperial hegemony to match their domestic one seemed at last to be realized. However, the latter period proved to be not a new beginning but rather an imperial swansong of the relationship between church 263 Clark, English Society, 25, 40, 170, 256–317. 264 Ibid., 40.
 and state as it had existed domestically from long before Anglicans began to address the issue of empire in 1701, and which reached its pinnacle in the oYcially supported Anglican colonial establishments such as that in India. Until then, at the end of the long eighteenth century, it must have seemed to all imperially minded Anglicans, of whatever theological hue, that here at last was the imperial state- supported extension of the Church of England dreamed of by some since the sixteenth century.
 A New Anglican Imperial Paradigm: In 1840 Charles BlomWeld, Bishop of London, wrote an open letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury proposing the establishment of a fund to endow colonial bishoprics. It was time, he believed, that the Church of England undertook its own extension to the colonies, instead of leaving this to individuals. BlomWeld maintained that it was still ostensibly the duty of a Christian government to attend to the spiritual needs of its colonies, but this duty, unfortunately, had not been eVectively carried out. Sections of Parliament were now questioning the maintenance and extension of the Church of England as a state obligation, and ‘there does not appear to much hope of our obtaining, at the present moment, in the actual state of the public revenue, any considerable aid from the national resources, for the purpose of planting andmaintaining the Church of this country in its colonies’.1 For BlomWeld, the planting of a colonial Church of England had come to have a necessary episcopal character. ‘[I]f we desire the good to be complete, permanent, and growing with the Church’s growth, we must plant the Church amongst them in all its integrity. Each colony must have, not only its parochial, or district pastors, but its chief pastor, to watch over, and guide, and direct the whole. An episcopal Church, without a bishop, is a contradiction in terms.’2He envisaged a colonial pattern of settlement thatwas integrally Anglican, complete with a bishop from the Wrst. ‘Let every band of 1 Charles BlomWeld, A letter to His Grace the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Upon the Formation of a Fund for Endowing Additional Bishoprics in the Colonies (London, 1840), 4. 2 Ibid., 5.
 settlers, which goes forth from Christian England, with authority to occupy a distinct territory, and to form a separate community, take with it not only its civil rulers and functionaries, but its bishop and clergy.’3 BlomWeld remained convinced that although it was a requirement of the government of a Christian state to both maintain and extend Christianity in all its dominions, however, the British government was now most unlikely to do so. If it took any steps in this direction at all it would be in the expanding industrial cities of Britain rather than in the empire.4 In the colonies themselves there was either a dearth of resources to provide for Anglican expansion, or a colonial indiVerence arising—in part, he believed—from that very situation of previous Anglican insuYciency on the ground. So, if the government shirked its duty then the church had to take this up, as the SPG had endeavoured to do so, albeit inadequately in place of the government.5 His proposed fund would be established speciW- cally for the moderate endowment of bishops in British colonies by the purchasing of land there; it would be administered by the bishops of the Church of England; and it would be complementary to, not instead of, money raised in the colonies themselves.6 In order to secure the legal status of these colonial bishops, letters patent issued by the Crown would be the way forward for this Anglican imperial extension.
 BlomWeld was hopeful of substantial contributions to the fund from the SPG, SPCK, and the CMS, and although he alluded to the possibility of the latter society having some diYculty with the pro- posed episcopal supervision of its missionaries, he insisted on the organization’s participation as ‘absolutely necessary’ to the complete- ness of the church’s purpose. The bishop also envisaged funding from the colonial settlement companies, because ‘a wiser proposal could not be made, for insuring even the temporal wellbeing of a new colony’.7 If the Church of England did not undertake this Angli- canizing of her colonial populations then, BlomWeld warned, ‘some other kindred Episcopal Churches would do so’. As his eight- eenth-century Anglican predecessors had done, he was raising the 3 Ibid., 7–8. 4 Ibid., 9–10. 5 Ibid., 11. 6 Ibid., 12–13. 7 Ibid., 13–14.
 spectre of a more forceful Roman Catholicism harvesting British colonists in the imperial absence of the Church of England.8 Conse- quently, it was now time for the Church of England to grasp the nettle of its own colonial future.
 BlomWeld, whose see had traditional responsibility for colonial churches in the empire, no sooner saw a need than he felt compelled to Wnd a solution. He found his solution in empowering the Church of England to act from its own resources alone to promote Anglicanism in the empire.
 The letter resulted in a meeting of Anglican clerics and male lay worthies at Willis’s Rooms in London on 27 April 1841 to commence the proposed fund. This public occasion was a platform for notable metropolitan Anglicans to publish their views on Anglicanism and empire. The chorus of voices was led oV by the Archbishop of Canter- bury, William Howley, who drew attention to factors that militated against the development of colonial Anglicanism, chief of which was the absence of bishops in these territories for episcopal rites, discipline, and superintendence. ‘A Church without a Bishop can hardly deserve the name of episcopal’, Howley aYrmed. A bishop would also bring great inXuence to bear on the morals and religion of a colonial popu- lation, and he instanced the West Indies which, since the arrival of its bishop sixteen years before, had increased its number of clergy and churches. This perspective of colonial Anglicanism was persisting with the blinkered positive spin with which the metropolitan church had regarded the West Indies since the eighteenth century. The bishop’s 8 BlomWeld, Letter to His Grace the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, 15. 9 Ibid., 15–16.
 arrival in those colonies in 1825 had had little eVect on the slave population, as most of the clergy remained enmeshed in slave man- agement, and were uncritical supporters of plantation slave-owning society.10 But it suited Howley’s case in the public launch of an Anglican episcopal initiative to the empire to use the West Indies as an argument for church extension being linked to the arrival of a colonial bishop, as the cause of more regular Christian practice there.
 He blamed the current lack of institutional Anglican provision in the colonies on a number of factors, including the previous history of British inattentiveness to religion in the establishment of their colonies as compared with the French. As a consequence, the Church of England declined while Dissent had grown in the American colonies. After the loss of these colonies, ‘the mistake was perceived’, said Howley, so that the British government began to inaugurate colonial bishops in Canada (which at the time meant Ontario and Quebec), Nova Scotia, and the West Indies.11 But now the church alone would continue this pattern of colonial bishoprics for British emigrants, as well as the heathen in British colonies who would ‘hereafter be converted and ranged under the banners of the Church’.
 This was gentle criticism of government dereliction of its duty towards the national church from a mild and conciliatory arch- bishop. But Howley, despite his almost innate conservatism, was also a realist who had come to understand the changed circumstances of the 1830s, perhaps through working with BlomWeld.13 BlomWeld followed Howley with a much more direct speech, stating that this 10 Catherine Hall, Civilising Subjects: Metropole and Colony in the English Imagin- ation, 1830–1867 (Oxford: Polity Press, and Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2002), 77. 11 Proceedings at a Meeting of the Clergy and Laity OYcially Called by His Grace, the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, and Held at Willis’s Rooms, 27th April, 1841, for the Purpose of Raising a Fund towards the Endowment of Additional Colonial Bishoprics (London, 1841), 3–4. 12 Ibid., 5. 13 Edward Carpenter, Cantuar: The Archbishops and their OYce (London: Cassell, 1971), 290–9.
 plan for colonial bishops was a virtual confession of past neglect, albeit this had begun to be reversed in the previous twenty-Wve years.
 BlomWeld proposed the Wrst resolution for the meeting, ‘That the Church of England, in endeavouring to discharge her unquestionable duty of providing for the religious wants of her members in foreign lands, is bound to proceed upon her own principles of Apostolical order and discipline’. Asking who it was should discharge that duty, he upheld the traditional Anglican view that this was undoubtedly the responsibility of a Christian state.
 As episcopacy was ‘essential to the perfectness of the Church’, it was therefore culpable that Britain had not extended this principle to her overseas churches compared with the missions of the Roman Catholic Church. The state had repeatedly refused this request of the church over the past century and a half. But now there were requests 14 Proceedings, 6. 15 Ibid., 7.
 coming not just from the church in England but also from the colonial churches themselves. It demonstrated that this want of bishops was global now that British dominions extended over all the earth. The obligation for such a world-wide episcopal provision was especially accentuated for the national church of an imperial nation.
 It is impossible for any one, who has considered the nature of the case, not to perceive that the Church of this country, the reformed Church of a country entrusted by Divine Providence with an empire of unprecedented magnitude, whose commerce is extended to the utmost parts of the globe, whose language now begins to be spoken in the remotest regions of the earth, a Church whose members are wafted over seas unknown to our forefathers:—that such a Church must be in the highest sense of the term a Missionary Church. It is impossible not to acknowledge that the duty of preaching the Gospel to the heathen, of planting the standard of the Cross in the dominions of the prince of the power of this world, has been entrusted with a supreme degree of responsibility to a Church, favoured with such advantages by Him who has founded it upon a rock.16
 This colonial extension of the episcopal Church of England was not principally a missionary obligation discharged by missionary societies, but rather was the responsibility of the church itself, regardless of what the state did, or did not do, about it. Consequently, these societies ought to exist in greater connection to the wider church at a time when the church was considering the responsibility of extending her polity to all the dependencies of the empire. Greater integration between missionary societies and the church would allow Anglicanism to present a united front throughout the empire.17
 Henry Thomas Pelham, third Earl of Chichester, in seconding BlomWeld’s resolution, also saw it as a means to rectify the neglect of Anglican colonial expansion in British history, which had resulted in ‘themoral and religious destitution of the British Colonies’. Pelham was a Whig and a temperate Evangelical who was one of the ecclesi- astical commissioners until 1878, and president of the CMS for half a century.18 The continued dereliction of religious duty resulted in ‘a state of things most adverse to the mere civil prosperity of the 16 Ibid., 12. 17 Ibid., 12–13. 18 G. Le G. Norgate, ‘Pelham,Henry Thomas, Third Earl of Chichester (1804–1886)’, rev. H.C.G. Matthew, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, vol. 43 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004) Colonies, and to the stability of their connexion with this country’.
 ‘Some imperial bond greater than mere commerce was required; some connecting moral principle, stronger than has yet existed, to attach the inhabitants of our vast and growing Colonies to their Mother Country.’ For the earl, this imperial unifying principle was the ‘preservation of our common faith’ and the establishment of its religious institutions, to whit, the national church. Bishops were necessary if the faith and church of the colonies was to be similar to that of Britain. The church, in this instance, should be ready to lead the state, though it was the duty of both to provide for the religious needs of its people at home or abroad.19
 The resolution having been passed unanimously, Justice Sir John Taylor Coleridge (nephew of the poet) proposed a second one. ‘That the want of Episcopal superintendence is a great and acknowledged want in the religious provisions hitherto made for many of the colonies and dependencies of the British Crown.’ The High Church Coleridge asked rhetorically what obstacles in ‘the vast Colonial Empire which the Almighty has entrusted to us’ would occur unless colonial churches were divided into manageable dioceses?21
 The Bishop of Winchester, the Evangelical Charles Sumner, seconded this resolution, asserting that, as a nation, Britain had not made the Christianizing of its colonies a priority, having done ‘little or nothing’ about it. ‘We have sent,—I speak in a national sense,— we have sent out our ships, but we have not sent our religion.We have 19 Proceedings, 13–14. 20 Ibid., 15. 21 Ibid., 15, 17.
 sent out our commerce, but we have not sent our religion . . .We have sent out our very crimes, but not our religion.’22 The nation had done little in the way of extending the Church of England to the empire, and now that prospect looked as unlikely as ever. ‘It is well known that it is the policy of the present day . . . to look upon all religious persuasions in our Colonial Dependencies with the same degree of favour.’ Consequently, it was all the more important that the speciWc polity of the Church of England was also extended to the colonies. Such a policy could only result in the improvement of colonial Anglican Churches. Unless the Church of England could be represented there in its completeness, ‘we shall not only have deserted our own bounden duty, but that those Colonies themselves will fatally experience the want of that moral and religious superintendence which gives the best security for the inculcation of scriptural principles, and for placing the conduct of man in his social relations on the truest and safest basis—on the doctrines of the Gospel, as taught by our Church’.23
 John Labouchere24 moved a third resolution, which was agreed unanimously: ‘That the acquisition of newColonies, and the formation of British communities invarious parts of theworld, render it necessary that an immediate eVort should be made to impart to them the full beneWt of the Church, in all the completeness of her ministry, ordinances, and government.’ He wished he could give the government as much credit for promoting the spiritual welfare of the colonies as for their temporal, or for upholding the interests of the Church of England, but it had been very remiss in this respect. In doing so the government had overlooked ‘one of the most eYcient means of ensuring the allegiance and attachment of the inhabitants of those colonies’. How- ever, Anglicans in England had been equally culpable, especially given the length of time Britain had possessed its colonies, and the beneWts it drew from them. Colonial bishops would also be useful in extending Anglicanism to the ‘idolators’ in their territories by fostering the missionary cause there.25
 Britain had ‘guardianship’ over one-eighth of the world’s population and one-eighteenth of the surface of the globe, the Tractarian Arch- deacon Henry Manning reminded the assembly, and the providence of God had entrusted to Britain the responsibility of evangelizing these colonial populations. Britain held her empire on this evangelistic condition. The work was of immense magnitude, beginning with do- mestic needs, and then on to established, and Wnally to new colonies.
 Manning pointed to Australia. Penitential colonies were established there without any attention to the spiritual means of recovering the convicts.27 Also, Manning repeated the theme of imperial unity grounded in a common Anglicanism throughout the empire, but gave it a new twist of ensuring imperial longevity. An empire required unity with itself, but this would only come about if the Church of England was enabled to export both its doctrine and its discipline so as to organize genuinely functioning colonial churches. If that were done, thenBritainwith aChristian empirewouldhave a share in theperpetuity promised by Christ to his church.
 Still at this time in his life prepared to be publicly and aggressively conWdent of the divine and apostolic commission of the Church of England, Manning called for it to be spread across the globe, because it had been given by God for the ‘pure restoration of the one Catholic faith, which . . . holds forth the brightest light in Christendom’.29 It was for him a salutary pointer to the ‘incredible growth in the moral strength of the English [church]’ that, whereas in 1814 Archbishop Manners-Sutton’s sermon at the consecration of Bishop Middleton had to remain unpublished, lest it rekindle heated divisions over a church establishment in India; now, in 1841, Manning exclaimed, the same church could meet in public assembly to discuss its extension into the whole empire.30
 William Gladstone submitted the next resolution, which was for the fund to be under the direction of the bishops. At the time he was the young Tory MP for Newark in the ultra-Tory Duke of Newcastle’s interest, and had just that month Wnished revising the fourth edition of his The State in its Relations with the Church, which expressed his support for the Anglican confessional state.31 The work was 28 Ibid., 25. 29 Ibid. 30 Ibid., 26. 31 H.C.G. Matthew, Gladstone, 1809–1874 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), 40–3.
 Gladstone had already established himself as having a public interest in the colonies, and was, brieXy during the government of Sir Robert Peel, under-secretary of state at the Colonial OYce for two months in 1835. In subsequent years, as an opposition an exposition of the church–state partnership paradigm that had prevailed since at least 1660, if not since 1558. It was the view that had operated in Anglican ecclesiastical, political, and imperial circles in the period covered so far. Originally written in 1838, Gladstone’s book was, as H.C.G. Matthew has pointed out, ‘probably the last point at which a general defence of Anglican hegemonic nationalism could be attempted’.32 Gladstone aYrmed that the state was a moral entity that had a duty to uphold religious truth, and therefore to require conformity to that truth, which was enshrined in the divinely instituted Church of England. David Bebbington has drawn atten- tion to Gladstone’s Notebooks for 1835, where the young politician encapsulated this argument as a series a propositions that later would be enshrined in his book.
 a more moderate conservatism, and from a (now) old-fashioned High Church establishmentarianism towards Tractarianism. Consequently, in 1841 he continued to uphold that the exclusive contract between the Church of England and the state held true abroad where, aside from the equally established Church of Scotland, no assistance should be given by the British government to other churches or faiths.35
 Gladstone, on the verge of a decade of intellectual and theological change, maintained the Church of England was essentially an autono- mous, true, and divine community, and therefore was the only proper partner for the state in England which, as a moral entity, had to be concerned with the upholding of truth.
 Accordingly, Gladstone aYrmed at the 1841 public meeting that the temporal connections between colonies and metropolis could be augmented by ‘ties of spiritual brotherhood’.36 He considered this was not an obligation primarily for the colonists themselves because it took some time before colonial prosperity, either as individuals or as a colony, was suYcient for the purpose. The majority of colonists were from the labouring classes, without capital, and almost completely caught up in a battle with the land for subsistence.37 If the church was to wait until colonists’ prosperity had risen suYciently for them to invest in religion, they may already have fallen into a habit of religious neglect. The church needed to bridge this gap between colonial disabil- ity and ability, if the habits of religion were to be kept alive in the colonial context. Gladstone also posited that if the time should come when colonies became independent, then former colonies would only maintain their connections with Britain if previous imperial foundations ‘were deeply laid in the recognition and maintenance of a common faith’.38
 The same year, 1841, not only saw the launch of the Colonial Bishoprics Fund, but also a declaration by the bishops of the United Church of England and Ireland on colonial bishops as a consequence of that fund, and the passing of the Colonial Bishops Act. The declaration was largely the bishops’ public acceptance of responsibil- ity for administering the fund established the previous month. How- ever, it also contained a statement about the Church of England and the colonies generally; that ‘insuYcient provision’ had been made for her members overseas, which now required the Church of England’s assistance in the form of colonial bishoprics to be established in thirteen parts of the empire, beginning with New Zealand, but also including South Australia, the district of Port Philip (predecessor of the state of Victoria), and Western Australia. The bishops thought it unwise to proceed ‘without the concurrence of her majesty’s Gov- ernment’, and so appointed a standing committee of their number with powers to confer with ministers.40 As a consequence, later that same year Parliament passed the Colonial Bishoprics Act (5 Vict., c.
 6), which gave legislative authority to the Church of England to create bishops for the colonies in keeping with the purpose and intent of the fund and the declaration, although Parliament’s remit was, strictly speaking, to legislate bishops for British subjects rather than for missionary purposes.41 Also in 1841, the bench of bishops of the Church of England became vice-presidents of the CMS, so bringing together the church and the most active and extensive 39 Proceedings, 29. 40 R.P.

 Anglican missionary society; that society having already agreed that the hierarchy of the Church of England should be the Wnal arbiter in any dispute between itself and colonial bishops.42
 In the early 1840s, then, leading national Anglican Wgures in church, politics, the judiciary, and among the aristocracy were publicly advocating that the Church of England initiate its own programme of colonial church extension, quite apart from the state. In doing so they were publicly critical of the state for not maintaining what they understood to be its proper concern to support the national church in the colonies. Although they were mindful of such support in recent decades, it was apparent to them by this time that this period of a renewed state–church alliance in the empire was not going to be sustained. This acceptance of the limits of state assistance for the Church of England, the consequent resolu- tions to act autonomously in promoting a colonial Anglicanism, the establishment of the Colonial Bishoprics Fund, and its consequent developments in 1841, were new aspects of the Anglican discourse on empire in the early years of the new decade.
 Some of the public comments of these leading churchmen main- tained themes that had comprised Anglican imperial discourse since the early eighteenth century. Notwithstanding recent decades, they spoke of how the Church of England had been neglected in the colonies, allowing Dissent and irreligion to grow there. They aYrmed that Britain had a responsibility for the spiritual welfare of British emigrants and for the evangelism of colonial heathens. Without the realization of this obligation, millions would perish eternally of irreligion because they knew not Christ and his gospel. Britain owed this duty to the colonies as a debt for the wealth its commerce and rule accrued to it. It also owed this to God, who had given Britain the empire in theWrst place, andwhose providential rule sustained that power on the condition of Britain fulWlling its divinely appointed spiritual obligations. The spiritual imperial bond that Britain could create in the proper fulWlment of this religious duty was the best, deepest, and most enduring unity the empire could have, as well as providing the most secure foundation for moral conduct in society.
 However, some of these statements in the early 1840s constituted rare public and direct criticism of the state oVered by Anglican pillars of the establishment, although it was couched in less than Wery terms.
 Speaker after speaker at the 1841 meeting had something to say about how the state had deserted its religious obligations to the Church of England, despite the reinvigoration of that alliance in the past few decades. BlomWeld, in his public letter of 1840, had stated that there did not seem much hope of Parliament supporting any longer the colonial planting of the Church of England, although he remained convinced it was a duty of Britain as a Christian state to do so.
 Archbishop Howley pointed out that the British government had provided for an Anglican establishment in its Canadian colonies as a consequence of the rebellion and loss of its other North American ones to the south. The implication from this cautious High Church- man that that lesson should continue to be learned was there for all to draw. Other speakers were more explicit. The Earl of Chichester urged the church to lead the state in this regard, though it was undoubtedly the duty of both to provide for domestic and colonial religious needs. For Bishop Sumner the prospect of the state privil- eging the Church of England over other denominations in the col- onies looked dismally unlikely, leaving the church to do her duty unaided. John Labouchere also regarded the government as having been inattentive in this colonial duty, thereby risking the future allegiance of its colonies; while for Manning that dereliction placed Britain in moral indebtedness to the colonies. Gladstone, then still a Tory, was unambiguous in stating that the maintenance and exten- sion of colonial religion was a duty of the whole nation and not just the church, which the state until then had only ‘partially fulWlled’, but which should be ‘more adequately recognised’. So all the principal speakers at the launch of this new colonial initiative by the Church of England were united in lamenting the demise of the state’s involve- ment in the transplantation of their church to British possessions overseas. All were equally sure that the present situation was unlikely to change. As a consequence, they supported this move by the Church of England to assume greater responsibility for its own colonial development, without the support of the state.
 P.J. Welch, writing in the 1960s, believed that cooperation between the state and the Church of England continued to be strong into the 1840s, despite some disagreements over practical politics in this decade, based on his assessment of the close working relationship between the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, and Bishop BlomWeld.
 However, even Welch’s own evidence demonstrated that the disagree- ments between church and state were substantive, including the failure to retain the separate bishoprics of Bangor and St Asaph, notwith- standing the overwhelming support of the bench of bishops; and the lack of political support for the maintenance of parliamentary grants for church extension.43 Rather than the old cooperation, the criticism of the state expressed publicly at the launch of the Colonial Bishoprics Fund, and the assumption of greater colonial activismby the Church of England, represented a watershed in the response to the situation the church found itself in by the 1840s. This was a realistic acknowledgement of developments of the 1820s and 1830s, a period that has been called a ‘constitutional revolution’ by GeoVrey Best,44 and the ‘end of the Protestant Constitution’ and the old order by Jonathan Clark.45
 Between 1828 and 1832 the Church of England lost its hegemonic status in England as a result of the passing of the Catholic Emanci- pationAct (which lifted all legal restrictions onRomanCatholics except those relating to succession to the crown) in 1828, the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts (which had legally disbarred Dissenters from public oYce) in 1829, and the Reform Act of 1832, which for the Wrst time enfranchised a portion of the non-landowning middle classes— the level of society where Dissent was strongest. These were elemental changes towhat had been encapsulated in the concept of the ‘Protestant constitution’, by which Anglicanism, monarchy, and an aristocratic social order provided the prevailing set of ideas that constituted the ideological framework of English political, cultural, and social life throughout the long eighteenth century. Of these forces, Clark argues, Anglicanism constituted the most signiWcant and inXuential; so much so that he believes England constituted a confessional state during this 43 P.J. Welch, ‘BlomWeld and Peel: A Study in Co-operation between Church and State, 1841–1846’, Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 12 (1961), 71–84. 44 GeoVrey Best, ‘The Constitutional Revolution, 1828–1832, and its Conse- quences for the Established Church’, Theology, 52 (1959), 226–34. 45 J.C.D.

 period in that, while other religious bodies existed and were agreed to exist legally, they were only tolerated and never formally permitted to enter the political institutions and oYces of the state. It was this hegemonic relationship between the Church of England and the state that had existed throughout the period so far covered by this investi- gation. In 1713 Bishop Gibson of London had encapsulated it for the largest section of the High Church party, which had entered into a Whig–Church alliance, in an understanding that was echoed by other Anglicans throughout the long eighteenth century.
 That the Spiritual Body was independent of and equal to the Temporal, that the Temporal Courts ought to be restrained from interference with the Ecclesiastical, that the clergy were the proper judges of the degree of assistance which the Church required from the State, and of the means by which that support should be rendered, and that the suppression of vice was the proper function of the Spirituality not of the laity.46
 The hegemony of the Church of England and the state was revived in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. As seen in the previous chapter, this hegemony can be clearly seen in the colonial policy of the British government, whereby the Church of England was introduced into colonies and supported by endowment in India, as also in Canada and the West Indies. This colonial endowment was an imperial mirror image of the same oYcial support for the established churches domestically, as in the parliamentary grants in 1818 and 1824 for church extension in England and Scotland.47 After 1815, according to Clark, with social unrest increasing, the Church of England became even more important as the guarantor of social and constitutional order and concurrently came under attack from those excluded from that system.48 To upholders of the status quo, the church alone appeared to be able to provide the requisite theoretical and ideological counter to the theorists of Dissent and revolution.
 Old Dissent was associated with pro-revolutionary positions and this, and its individualism, were perceived as making its nationalism and patriotism very conditional. New Dissent was conservative, but 46 Clark, English Society, 101. 47 Stewart J. Brown, The National Churches of England, Ireland, and Scotland (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), 68–72. 48 Clark, English Society, 421–8.
 placed the nation and nationalism very much after a converted Christianity and conscience that knew no national boundaries in its fellowship of the converted. But the old Anglican theology provided a basis for civil society that qualiWed individualism by the greater importance of communal Christianity and church allegiance.49 So the Anglican theorist John Bowles, a High Church layman, could comment in 1815 that the constitutional order of the country was ‘composed of two distinct establishments, the one civil, the other ecclesiastical, which are so closely interwoven together, that the destruction of either must prove fatal to both’.50
 Bishop BlomWeld, who initiated this drive for greater imperial autonomy by the Church of England, had himself previously been a proponent of the old regime. Born in 1786, he rose to the episcopal bench as Bishop of Chester in 1824. During that episcopate he was an opponent of Catholic emancipation, on the basis that as heretics they had no place in the Protestant constitution of England. He did, though, favour the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, not from any large sympathy for Dissenters but because he considered that using the sacrament of Holy Communion as a political test was a profanation that the Church of England clergy could well do without.51
 to Catholic emancipation, as the catalyst for the end of this old order, and brought an end to the Anglican hegemony within it. In its place came a storm of anticlericalism and anti-church militancy as a consequence of the Church of England’s belated and unhappy opposition to political reform. The bishop’s palace in Bristol was burned down, and bishops were mobbed, and burned in eYgy. For the SPG preacher in the fateful year of 1832, the Bishop of Rochester, it was nothing less than a further sign of the reign of the Antichrist.
 But while there was Anglican lamenting in the late 1820s and early 1830s at the passing of the old ways, the ultimate response of the Church of England to the fundamental alteration in its place in English society and its alliance with its rulers was to assert its own independence, now that the state had deserted its responsibilities towards the church. As evidence of this, Clark points to the Tractarian Movement of the 1830s and 1840s, and to a growing ecclesiastical assertiveness among the younger generation of High Churchmen, such as these words of Walter Hook, Vicar of Leeds, in 1831: As a Church, the Reformed Catholic Church in England will be beneWted by its disunion from the State; but, as the Bishop of Limerick observes, the question is not whether the Church be less pure, but the country be not more pure . . . I refer our calamities to the repeal of the Test Act; for then the State virtually renounced every connection with religion. It pronounced religion to be, so far as the State is concerned, a thing indiVerent. England is now in the position of a man who has excommunicated himself.54
 But evidence for a new Anglican assertiveness can also be found in the episcopal preachers of the SPG in the 1830s. In 1835 even the cautious Richard Bagot, Bishop of Oxford, while deploring that 52 George Murray, Bishop of Rochester, A Sermon (1832), 12. 53 Ibid., 13. 54 Clark, English Society, 359–60.
 the government of a Christian nation should have withdrawn its support for the society, called on his hearers to Wll the gap left by the government. It was, he said, ‘our duty as Christians to increase our private and individual exertions, proportionally to such a loss, in every practicable way’, and he proposed parish committees to encourage lay involvement with the society and the increase of ‘smaller donations’.55 The next year, the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol (from 1836 to 1897 it was a joint diocese) drew attention to the fact that, ‘at the very moment’ when North American emigration increased, annual grants of public money for the Church of England in those colonies was withdrawn. Ultimately, he foretold, this would have a deleterious eVect on imperial unity, for ‘no bond of union is so strong between distant nations as that of a common faith and a common worship’. The remedy he also called for was greater support for the society among churchmen at home.56 The feisty Henry Phillpot of Exeter, as preacher in 1838, managed to make his point in a backhanded way by disclaiming any intention to ‘charge our rulers with neglecting their Wrst duty’, because this was not such an occasion. The government was ready, he professed, to perform this duty, but it was ‘deterred by the unrighteous, the unchristian clamour against every expenditure which has religion for its object, especially if it be in that form which the laws of the land recognize as true’. If the government would but realize that they too would face the judgement of God, he was sanguine that they would recall their duty, and unite in reversing the present policy of putting ‘National Piety on a short allowance’.57
 The drive for imperial self-suYciency by the Church of England in the early 1840s must be placed alongside these statements of the 1830s, and its more widely recognized domestic responses as part of this watershed in the development of Anglicanism in response to the demise of the old order. The 1840s were, as Hans Cnattingius identiWed in 1952, the turning point of change for Anglicanism, whereby it evolved into a ‘World Church’. It was change that had already been foreshadowed outside Britain and the empire in the 55 Richard Bagot, Bishop of Oxford, A Sermon (1835), 9–10. 56 James Monk, Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, A Sermon (1836), 12–13. 57 Henry Phillpot, Bishop of Exeter, A Sermon (1838), 13–14.
 1830s, with the idea mooted in 1835 by Bishop George Washington Doane of New Jersey for missionary bishops to lead, rather than follow, missionary outreach. These ideas were picked up by Bishop Samuel Wilberforce and Bishop BlomWeld in the late 1830s.58 The catalyst for greater initiative by the Church of England towards missionary expansion has been ascribed by Cnattingius to a demand within that church stimulated by the Oxford Movement, and the rapprochement between the CMS and the bishops. But this is to ascribe too much to the church, and not enough to the fundamental paradigm shift that dethroned Anglicanism from its hegemonic position in the years 1828 to 1832. Change was forced upon the church, which took a decade to embrace it. It also attributes too much to the Oxford Movement which, as a consequence of increa- sing Roman Catholic sympathies and Newman’s Tract XC was, in the early 1840s, a more marginalized movement within Anglican circles of power, looked at by Evangelicals and High Churchmen alike with suspicion and hostility.59
 In the early 1840s a new imperial paradigm for the Church of England was created from within the central power structures of the church itself. It was the initiative of the Bishop of London, who was probably the most powerful and active bishop at the time, notwithstanding the two archbishops. It had the support of other principal Anglicans, both lay and clerical, and from the rising gen- eration in church and state, such as Gladstone and Manning. A new Anglican imperial paradigm arose at this time because these inXuen- tial and mainstream Anglicans understood only too well that the old one was defunct, and most unlikely to rise again from its political grave. BlomWeld’s initiative with regard to the Colonial Bishoprics Fund provided these Anglicans with the requisite practical direction, in a paradigm shift for Anglicanism to adapt to the new domestic and imperial reality, which now left it without its former hegemonic status in the British metropolitan and colonial world. It was one in which episcopacy was now to be the basis for a global Anglicanism.
 Bishops would now be indispensable to colonial Anglicanism, their 58 Hans Cnattingius, Bishops and Societies: A Study of Anglican Colonial and Missionary Expansion, 1698–1850 (London: SPCK, 1952), 200–6 59 Frank Turner, John Henry Newman: The Challenge to Evangelical Religion (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2002), chs. 7 and 8.
 presence guaranteed and resourced by the Colonial Bishoprics Fund; and not just for British colonies, but wherever signiWcant numbers of Anglicans were to be found. Consequently, the fund also proposed to endow a bishopric for Anglicans in Europe,60 and also the bishop in Jerusalem that Newman so opposed because it was a combined project with Lutherans, but was to ensure the genuinely episcopal character of a future Anglican Church in the Holy Land.61 Now that the Church of England was conscious of its need to act autono- mously, it was no longer prepared to subjugate or suppress its epis- copal character as it had done in the North American colonies for most of the eighteenth century. The new paradigm was for a deliberately and consciously episcopal Anglican Church as a given for colonial Anglicanism. It was a new way of being Anglican imperi- ally that evidently caught the imagination of some very signiWcant Anglicans in England. The fabulously wealthy Angela Burdett-Coutts, heiress to the Coutts banking fortune, gave £35,000 in 1845 to endow the new dioceses of South Australia and Cape Town, and £50,000 in 1858 to endow a bishopric in British Columbia when that became a crown colony.62
 This episcopal foundation for colonial Anglicanism was not agreed to by all metropolitan Anglicans, the CMS and its innovative secretary, Henry Venn, being the major exceptions. Venn strongly believed that bishops were for the consolidation of a missionary church once it was established, rather than being part of the initial evangelistic thrust. The conXict between these two ideals came to a head in the 1850s in India.63 However, this distinction should not be exaggerated, as Venn was not anti-episcopal. He agreed to the alteration in the CMS structure that made bishops the Wnal arbiters in its disputes, and that missionary Anglican Churches should be episcopal, even to being at the forefront of agitating for a native, rather than European, episcopate. It was more an argument about precisely when that episcopal structure should be put in place— 60 ‘Declaration of a Meeting of Archbishops and Bishops, Held at Lambeth, on Tuesday in Whitsun Week 1841’, in Flindall, The Church of England, 95. 61 Turner, John Henry Newman, 395–7. 62 Diana Orton, Made of Gold: A Biography of Angela Burdett Coutts (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1980), 105, 185. 63 Williams, The Ideal of the Self-governing Church, 9–21.
 whether at the very commencement of a mission or subsequently— rather than any dispute over episcopacy as such. Both Anglican sides aYrmed an episcopal church; their dispute was over just when that episcopacy should be instituted in new churches. Nevertheless, it was the paradigm of a fully episcopal church, from its beginning or as soon as feasible thereafter, that was enshrined in the resolutions of the 1841 London meeting that gave birth to the Colonial Bishoprics Fund and the consequent parliamentary legislation that same year.
 In the early 1840s the Church of England created a new paradigm of engagement with the British Empire, replacing the old one that had operated since a conscious concern for Anglican missions in that empire began in 1701. The old paradigm was founded on the constitutional settlement that prevailed throughout the long eighteenth century. It had accepted and defended the alliance of the church with the state as a mutually beneWcial partnership between two autonomous bodies; with the state, as a moral entity, having a duty to uphold the Church of England exclusively, because it was the purest and divinely appointed embodiment of the most truthful form of Christianity, which was Protestantism. While the Church of England acknowledged that this former paradigm had not always been adhered to fully by the state during the eighteenth century, it was encouraged by its revival at home and abroad in the decades after the loss of the North American colonies and the French Revolution.
 During the 1830s the Church of England came to accept, reluctantly, the end of this religious-political-social arrangement, and conse- quently, in 1840–1, a new Anglican paradigm was developed as a response to the demise of the old one, following the political accept- ance of religious equality and pluralism by the British state in the years between 1828 and 1832. This new Anglican imperial paradigm promoted the need for more autonomous action and an episcopal identity by the Church of England in the colonies and elsewhere. It was a bowing to the inevitable that the empire was now no longer likely to be an Anglican one, because the British state had relin- quished its substantive connection with the Church of England in favour of denominational pluralism for all forms of Trinitarian Christianity.
 The old did not instantly replace the new. Rather, for some time both paradigms co-existed in the empire. This is shown by a comparison between the two white settler colonies of Australia and New Zealand, on the one hand, with those we have examined in North America and Bengal, on the other. Both these newer colonieswitnessed the operation of the new Anglican imperial paradigm. But in Australia, the old only reluctantly gave way to the new under the leadership of the Bishop of Australia, theHighChurchWilliamGrant Broughton. InNewZealand, Bishop George Augustus Selwyn readily embraced the new Anglican self-governing and episcopal paradigm from the beginning of his episcopate in that colony, but in doing so built on the work of the CMSmissionaries there, whose voluntary mission had existed without episcopal oversight since 1814.
 The New Paradigm in the Colonies: Anglicanism in the unique penal colony of New South Wales began under the old paradigm in 1788, when the ancien regime still ruled unchallenged in England. Consequently, this colonial Church of England was enmeshed with state support from its beginning, and reXected the revival of the church–state alliance in the period from its beginnings in 1788 until the late 1820s. Thereafter, there was a reluctant withdrawal from the old paradigm by the colonial Anglican leadership until the new had Wnally surfaced unequivocally by 1850.
 During these Wrst decades of Anglicanism in this anomalous colony there was only belated and Wtful engagement with Australia’s indi- genous peoples. Conversely, in New Zealand, Anglican engagement preceded colonization by over two decades, and when Anglican episcopacy Wnally began there, it did so with the explicit intention of implementing the new paradigm of ecclesiastical engagement with the empire. Throughout these Wrst decades of Anglicanism in New Zealand Anglican attention was very much primarily on the mission to the Maori, the successful conversion of whom became one of the highlights of Anglican mission history in the nineteenth century.
 The only SPG preacher to mention Australia in the years of the old order was the strict Tory George Huntingford, Bishop of Gloucester, in 1805. He reminded his hearers that even convicts were still human beings and British subjects, who could be redeemed as members of civil society. Very optimistically, he believed the only reason the lower orders did not attend the Church of England was because of a lack of churches for an expanding population, for the masses ‘love the Church of England’. This lack of attendance was, however, he said—no doubt with one eye on revolutionary France—‘pregnant with moral and political mischief ’. What was true at home was also true of the colonies, and especially of New South Wales, where the children of convicts would imbibe their parents’ corrupt principles.
 The bishop was advocating imperial Anglicanism for the same reason as the government during these decades of rejuvenated oYcial sup- port for the Church of England. The church taught the politically important virtues of subordination and political quietude. But the bishop could also foresee the day when Australia would command the respect of the nations of the world, and it was therefore impor- tant to cultivate in its inhabitants imperial aVections by fostering among them the apostolic, episcopal religion established in Great Britain.1 Anglicanism would be the spiritual and moral bond of empire, even among its least likely colonists, who were involuntarily transported into it in penal servitude.
 As part of the imperial revival of a state-sponsored Church of England, Australian Anglicanism began with a substantive state connection in the form of clergy who were military chaplains, appointed by the government to the penal colony of Botany Bay from 1788. Governor Arthur Phillip had under him 19 oYcers and about 200 other ranks, with some wives and children. When the Xeet Wnally sailed on 13 May 1787 these personnel had in their charge approximately 730 convicts—men, women, and children.2
 would only weaken the Protestant ascendancy in Ireland and in England.3 Governor Phillip’s instructions included the enforcement of religion and the establishment of public worship according to the rites of the Church of England. He was also to execute laws against immorality and to uphold Sabbath observance.4
 But whereas the Church of England in colonies such as Canada, with well-established or growing settler populations, received increased government infrastructure, the home government saw no advantage in colonies with small settler populations having anything more than a minimum church provision. So the initial decades of penal settlement, between 1788 and 1820, just twelve Church of England chaplains in the Australian mainland colonies, and two in VanDiemen’s Land, were paid for by the crown, which also gave them land for their own use and for their churches.5
 The Wrst chaplain, the Evangelical Richard Johnson, preached his Wrst sermon in Australia, to troops and convicts, at Sydney Cove on 3 February 1788, just days after the Wrst Xeet landed. On 17 February he celebrated his Wrst service of Holy Communion in a marquee. But as the sole Christianminister, with the governor the source of all resources and inXuence, Johnson’s work was necessarily dependent upon the goodwill of the authorities. Arthur Phillip was typical of many in the eighteenth-century British ruling orders in holding the church to be useful primarily as a means of maintaining public morality and social subordination. Within a matter of months Phillip had allocated a site for a church at Sydney Cove, but limited resources did not allow him to allocate any building materials. He also set aside 400 acres as glebe land for the support of this church, and all convicts had to attend Johnson’s Church of England services, by order of the governor.6
 Therefore, as a gentleman, Johnson believed Grose was using him abominably. It was their social position, it was commonly believed, that enabled the clergy of the established church to inXuence the upper orders and, through the ruling classes and their higher social standing, to bring morality and belief to social subordinates.
 brought about a closer relationship between colonial church and state.
 Hunter was also an Evangelical, and he demonstrated the importance he and the imperial government attached to the church’s role in society by reappointing Johnson to the bench of magistrates; he similarly appointed the second chaplain, Samuel Marsden. In 1798, Hunter oYcially consulted both chaplains on the colony’s moral condition, and reissued instructions for a return to compulsory church parades by convicts. But this was only partially enforced and when, in 1798, Hunter attempted strict enforcement, the church was burnt down by person or persons unknown. He also enacted regulations for the control of the rum trade, and for Sabbath observance. Clearly, under Hunter, church and state worked together amicably, even 7 Ibid., 67.
 enthusiastically, to implement the contemporary imperial religious and political agenda for a well-ordered society.8
 In 1798 there was also the Wrst indication that the Anglicans would not always enjoy a monopoly of religion in the New South Wales colony. That year Johnson welcomed a group ofWesleyanmissionaries who had been forced to leave Tahiti because of a tribal war.9 Yet at the demise of Hunter’s governorship in 1800 (when Johnson too returned to Britain) Anglican ascendancy, with its legal and social monopoly in the small colony, continued for the time being. As military chaplains, their salaries were paid by the colonial government, from whence they also received houses, land grants, and use of convict labour to clear and work their land. Ameasure of independence for the Church of England from the oYcialmilitarywas establishedby SamuelMarsdenduring his visit to England from 1807 to 1810. He desired the end of the clergy’s appointment as military chaplains, preferring instead that the church establish a genuine parish-based clergy in New South Wales, as in England. Not only would this enable parochial Anglican clergy to minister to the increasing numbers of free and emancipated settlers in New South Wales, but also, Marsden believed, it would release the clergy from the military authority of the governor. Marsden did not entirely convince the British colonial authorities, but did manage to eVect a change in his own commission from a military to a civil one.10
 The wisdom of this alteration in clerical status became evident in Marsden’s growing estrangement from the new governor, Lachlan Macquarie, after Marsden’s return to New South Wales, as the senior churchman in the colony, in 1810. Macquarie, also a convinced Evangelical, began to use his autocratic powers to alter the chap- laincy, placing the clergy under his direct control. ConXict between Marsden and Macquarie, by then the two senior Wgures in colonial church and state in New South Wales, came to a head in 1816. It involved an argument that became an important step in the recog- nition of the Church of England in the colony as an institution in its own right, and not merely subordinate to the colonial govern- ment. In 1816 a chaplain, the Revd Benjamin Vale, became entangled 8 Macintosh, Richard Johnson, ch. 6. 9 Ibid., 91. 10 Ross Border, Church and State in Australia, 1788–1872: AConstitutional Study of the Church of England in Australia (London: SPCK, 1962), 28.
 with the arrest of an American schooner whose cargo Governor Macquarie had given permission to be landed for the colony. Vale and a young solictor had arranged for the ship to be arrested under the Navigation Acts—old mercantilist measures that forbade imports into the British colonies in non-British vessels, but were largely antiquated and ignored. The historian Ross Border believes that the two young men may have been acting as stooges for Justice Bent, who was at loggerheads with the governor over the latter’s taxation powers. Mac- quarie arrested Vale and, to make an example of him, court martialled him in his capacity as a military chaplain for insubordination and sedition. Vale was only found guilty of the lesser charge, but Marsden protested against this court martial of a clergyman as being a person of ‘sacred character’—a description that hardly seems suitable to the unfortunate Vale. Eventually this led to Lord Bathurst, the colonial secretary, agreeing that the governor had no legal power to discipline chaplains as military personnel. Bathurst’s decision was one of the factors that prompted Macquarie’s resignation. It was, nevertheless, a step towards the Church of England establishing a distinct identity and a normal structure in the penal colony.11
 The development of a customary parochial structure in New South Wales was not before time, as the population was growing.
 It was necessary for the Church of England to develop a parish structure in order to minister not just to the convicts but, increas- ingly, to a growing non-convict population. A major step towards such a structure was the appointment in 1824 (by the Tory govern- ment of the Duke of Wellington) of Thomas Scott as Archdeacon of New South Wales, within the Diocese of Calcutta. Following a rebellion by the New South Wales Corps, in 1819 Lord Bathurst had accepted an imperial commission’s recommendations about the Church of England in the colony that were designed to make it more eYcient in a changing situation. Parishes were to be estab- lished, with a school in each under the control of the vicar. The 11 Ibid., 29–37. 12 Stephen Judd and Kenneth Cable, Sydney Anglicans: A History of the Diocese (Sydney: Anglican Information OYce, 2000), 11.
 Thomas Scott was Archdeacon of New South Wales from 1825 to 1829. During his time the Anglican ascendancy reached its climax, but also began to be eVectively challenged. At Wrst it seemed secure, as the colonial government made further moves towards the estab- lishment of the Church of England in keeping with the revived partnership in this period. One piece of legislation made the Angli- can clergy the sole ministers legally able to register births, deaths, and marriages; and another required intending publicans to obtain a certiWcate of good character from an Anglican priest, who were the only authorities licensed to dispense such certiWcates. The climax of this gradualist move towards legal establishment came with the institution of the Church and Schools Corporation in 1826. The corporation was established in New South Wales on the instructions of the British government, and it was designed to put education and morality—for a colony that seemed more depraved than most—under Anglican control.14 It was a colonial reXection of the 13 Border, Church and State, 41–5. 14 Kelvin Grose, ‘Why Was Hobbes Scott Chosen as Archdeacon of New South Wales?’, Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society, 69 (1984), 260–1.
 same tussle to provide national elementary education that was being waged in England by the Anglicans and their Nonconformist competitors. It was also an indication of the intention of the col- onial secretary, Lord Bathurst, to establish the Church of England throughout the empire.15 By the terms of the corporation, the Church of England was granted a seventh of all colonial crown lands for the provision of parishes and schools.16 The funds and property of the corporation were to be administered by trustees, and the wealth generated would also lead to the Church of England becoming independent of state grants. The corporation would clearly give the Church of England an unassailable advantage over other churches in the colony. Obviously, it was intended by the British government that the Church of England would occupy in New South Wales the same privileged position it held in England. Not only would the corporation ensure land, and thus wealth, for the Church of England out of proportion to its colonial strength, but it would also draw oV available funds from the other denominations.
 Almost immediately this initiative of imperial support for the Church of England ran into colonial opposition. The strength of that opposition, and the changing political scene back in England, meant that the corporation, and the Anglican legal, political, and religious monopoly in New South Wales that it represented, could not be maintained for more than a few years. By 1826 it was already far too late into the changes that were working through British society in the nineteenth century for the survival of any government intention to establish the Church of England in Australia. Possibly it could have been implemented successfully ten years earlier, when the eighteenth-century paradigm of the old order still ruled unchal- lenged in Britain. But under attack in Britain, the ancien regime there would be toppled in the constitutional revolution between 1828 and 1832, which eVectively disempowered theChurch of England’s established status. But by the late 1820s colonial factors also contri- buted towards preventing the Church of England maintaining any 15 Kelvin Grose, ‘What Happened to the Clergy Reserves of New South Wales?’, Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society, 72 (1985), 92. 16 Brian H. Fletcher, ‘Christianity and Free Society in New South Wales, 1788– 1840’, Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society, 86 (2000), 98.
 Opposition Wgures used the press to bring Archdeacon Scott and the Church and Schools Corporation into public disfavour. They argued that the government-sponsored advantage given to the Church of England was a piece of hierarchical English life unnecessary and un- wanted in the colony. This argument attracted a large measure of support among a population that included many ex-convict emanci- pists, who naturally resented any signs of the export of the sort of privileged English society that had been responsible for transporting them to Australia in the Wrst place.
 Consequently, the corporation was suspended by order of the secretary of state for the colonies, Sir George Murray, in his despatch of 25 May 1829, after nearly 420,000 acres had been granted to the church, and it was legally terminated in 1833.18 SigniWcantly, when Scott’s successor, William Broughton, went to England in 1834 to ask the Colonial OYce whether the lands formerly vested in the corporation were only to be applied to the use of religion and education according to the Church of England, he was told they were for the maintenance and promotion of religion and education in the colony without reference to any particular denomination.19
 Archdeacon Scott left New South Wales in 1829 and was replaced the same year by the High Church William Grant Broughton. Every- thing about Broughton’s life experience at the time of arriving in Sydney made him a proponent of the old Anglican hegemonic paradigm. Born in 1788 of a family with modest means, the death of an uncle brought him the means to go up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he imbibed a virile High Churchmanship that defended the established order. He learned critical scholarship of the Bible fromHerbertMarsh, who had studied at German universities yet roundly condemned the Bible Society for distributing Bibles without the Book of Common Prayer. Churchmen who supported such policies, Marsh believed, soon became lax towards Dissent and 17 Border, Church and State, ch. 5. 18 Grose, ‘Clergy Reserves’, 92–3. 19 Ibid., 94–5.
 Dissent’s agenda of repeal of the Test Act. Marsh, like his pupil, also upheld the National Society for the Education of the Poor according to the Principles of the Church of England, which was committed to using the Prayer Book Catechism in its schools. As a curate, Broughton’s scholarship in support of King Charles I as a royal martyr attracted the patronage of the truculent High Churchman Bishop George Tomline of Winchester. His next patron was the Duke of Wellington, despite the fact that Broughton had signed a number of petitions opposing Catholic emancipation. It was through the duke that he was made the oVer of Archdeacon of New South Wales, though Broughton knew it oVered little Wnancial reward.20
 In his Wrst major public sermon in Sydney soon after his arrival in 1829 he spoke of the providential guidance behind the expansion of the British Empire that had been so much a part of the old paradigm.
 But Broughton proved himself to be one who did not take his own advice, steadfastly refusing to take a new view of events and instead adhering steadfastly to the old partnership paradigm of church and state in the empire. From 1832 he fought the new Whig governor, Richard Bourke, over his demotion in precedence from third to fourth in the colony (the colony’s senior military oYcer was pro- moted in precedence over him), and over his removal from the civil list of guaranteed salaried oYcers as his original instruction stated his position should be, because these changes were to him (correctly) indicators that the new Whig government in Britain and its colonial outriders intended to downgrade the traditional place in society and government of the Church of England. Broughton continued to harp on these things with the Colonial OYce when he returned to England in 1834, though the government considered them decided.22 Bourke, 20 G.P. Shaw, Patriarch and Prophet: William Grant Broughton, 1788–1853: Colonial Statesman and Ecclesiastic (Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 1978), 2–12. 21 Ibid., 20. 22 Ibid., 84.
 It was also one that Broughton, doughty defender of the old way, was equally determined to oppose.
 Preaching in St James’s church in Sydney on 26 January 1834, the forty-sixth anniversary of the founding of the colony of New South Wales, Broughton set forth the usual Anglican argument used as the basis for the old political establishment of religion. But in a colonial context hostile to such Anglican teaching he fell short of making that call explicit. Instead, while urging his hearers to strive to have ‘our faith established’ in colonial society, he preferred to point to greater individual practice and example as the means to do so.24
 It was while he was in London that Broughton communicated with the SPG for the Wrst time, writing them a begging letter on 8 December 1834 and giving his summary of the state of the Church of England in the Australian colonies, and New South Wales particu- larly. In this metropolitan setting he pulled no punches in setting out an argument for imperial responsibility towards the morality and religion of Britain’s penal colony. He noted that until the middle of 1826 the British government had provided religious instruction 23 Shaw, Patriarch and Prophet, 61. 24 William Grant Broughton, Religion Essential to the Security and Happiness of Nations (Sydney, 1834).
 Newly consecrated as Bishop of Australia, Broughton returned to Sydney from England in 1836 and resumed his seat on both the legislative and executive councils, in keeping with the usual political 25 Broughton to SPG, London, 9 December 1834, SPG, Annual Report (1835), 190–6.
 place of Anglican bishops since the Reformation, though Governor Bourke tried hard to exclude him. The Church Act passed in New South Wales in that same year provided government subsidies to all denominations, if local congregations could raise their share of the overall funding required. Broughton raised no objection to the bill in the legislative council as being the best outcome the Church of England could hope for in the new political realties, but he remained as Wrmly opposed as ever to the non-establishment principle behind it of government aiding less perfect churches than the Church of England; churches that were also in conXict with each other rather than the state having the beneWt of the homogeneity of the Church of England. For the same reason he opposed Bourke’s plan to fund non-denominational schools based on the Irish National System, and resolutely set his course to achieve state aid for denominational schools in order to preserve the integrity of Anglicanism among the rising generations. In the old paradigm, education had been the business of the church as beWtted its role as the custodian of truth and moral and social order; but in the new, that role passed to the state, as Bourke believed it should.26
 But Broughton remained opposed to the political liberalism of Bourke and his British masters with respect to the Whig non- denominational support for religion. It led, he told the SPG in 1838, to the ‘lax and dangerous opinion that there is in religion nothing that is either certain or true’. Broughton hoped to retain the Anglican supremacy in education that had been characteristic of the old order.
 He soon left the Protestant Association, which had been formed in Sydney to lobby for pan-Protestant church schools, letting its Dissenting members know that the only cooperation they could expect from him was if Dissent was willing to shelter under the wing of Anglican schools, albeit with freedom for their own religious instruction.27
 In the account of the proceedings of the society’s 1838 annual meeting, Justice Coleridge presented a metropolitan Anglican view of the Australian colonies.
 It was, he maintained, the fault of the government in not subsidizing the contributions of the society and his diocesan SPG committee, on the basis that they were not private contributions. Accordingly, the preservation of even the name and form of Christianity in many parts of that district was being ‘fatally retarded’.30 But about the same time he began to present a more positive picture of church-desiring colonists. On his Wrst visit to the new settlement of Melbourne he found the church there Wlled, despite the torrential rain; and the same in his subsequent visit to Van Diemen’s Land, where in 28 SPG, Annual Report (1838), 60–1. 29 Ibid., 61–2. 30 Ibid. (1841), lvii–lviii.
 In Launceston—a congregation of just Wve members eight years before—Wlled the church now that it was built, so that ‘the walls cannot contain those who are anxious to hear the Word of God within them’. Colonists exhibited a ‘strong’ disposition to attend churches where they were provided. Broughton was giving metro- politan donors another colonial picture of pious, church-desiring colonists in order to prove successful his remedy of church extension for colonial irreligion and immorality. He could not ‘doubt that, under such a disposition of the means of grace, a gradual but certain improvement of the moral and religious condition of the inhabitants is taking place’. He admitted that in both Van Diemen’s Land and New South Wales these improvements were ‘surrounded . . . by much that is base and disgusting’. But church building was resulting in ‘a preponderating proportion of integrity and worth’ that, if supported, would cause to ‘spring forth a wise and understanding people to occupy this land’. These congenial church-going colonists he found to be ‘exemplary and deserving’, and displaying wherever he went on this long diocesan visitation an ‘anxiety . . . to possess the observances of religion and the guidance of their proper ministers’.31
 It was not until 1838 that Broughton began to show indications that he too was prepared to venture into the new Anglican imperial paradigm, to go where the Church of England went without the backing or the sanction of the state. Bruce Kaye dates this change in Broughton’s outlook to the 1840s, but this overlooks the evidence from Broughton’s visit to New Zealand (which Shaw Wnds compel- ling), and also arguments in his sermons from the later 1830s oVered here.32 In December that year he went to New Zealand in response to the urging of the Church Missionary Society that a bishop visit there, notwithstanding that his Letters Patent only made him Bishop of Australia, legally empowered to perform sacramental functions in the ‘said See of Australia, but not elsewhere’.33 For Broughton, by this time, his ecclesiastical authority given him by his consecration at the 31 Broughton to SPG, 22 May 1838, ibid. (1838), 101–5. 32 Bruce Kaye, ‘Broughton and the Demise of the Royal Supremacy’, Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society, 81 (1995), 39–51. 33 Shaw, Patriarch and Prophet, 125–7.
 hands of bishops of the Church of England was beginning to loom larger than the royal commission. It was the church and not the state that made him a bishop in the church of God, and he was now prepared to act upon the independent spiritual authority of that consecration. As his biographer pointed out, ‘the trip to New Zealand proved to Broughton that he had an apostolic ministry.
 He had come to New South Wales to serve an establishment: he remained now to serve a church.’34 Broughton also spoke publicly of this spiritual authority in a sermon on ‘The Apostolic Commission’ the following year at an ordination. He found this authority residing in bishops because they inherited a succession of episcopal ministry stretching back to the apostles, whereby Christ gave authority to the church such that ‘no admission to the ministry was acknowledged to be scriptural and valid, except it was conveyed by the laying on of the hands of bishops’.35
 From now on, Broughton would point to another colonial identity in Australia alongside the more common one of Australia as a sink of moral iniquity arising out of its penal colonization. The SPG, for example, in 1838 spoke of ‘the dreadful state of wickedness into which the great body of the people throughout these colonies were falling’.36 But the increasing numbers of respectable, church-going colonists pointed to a diVerent future for this blot on Britain’s imperial record. In his report the following year, Broughton main- tained that sixteen out of every twenty-three colonists in Van Die- men’s Land were Church of England, and that they were, ‘with some exceptions . . . warmly attached to it’, and were proceeding to mark their religious and moral attachment by the erection of churches in various parts of the colony.37 In 1840 he was even more sweeping, claiming that colonial attachment to the Church of England was such that ‘in no one instance, of which I am aware, has this same consequence failed to follow. The churches are no sooner built and opened, than the sittings are engaged and occupied.’38

(1839), 123. 38 Broughton to SPG, 24 June 1840, ibid. (1841), clvii.
 Broughton understood that this was not the only possible colonial representation. He had himself previously reported to the SPG in London on the colonists as degenerate, both religiously and morally.
 But now he was portraying church-going settlers as agents of religious and morally improving change in this disturbing colonial landscape, probably because this facilitated the continued resourcing of the provision of churches by metropolitan funds from the SPG. It was an exciting and tantalizing prospect to hold out to the Anglican readership of the society’s Proceedings. Through their missionary oVerings, they could directly inXuence the transformation of Austra- lian colonial society; they could be the means of working an alchemy that brought out of the dross of these penal colonies the gold of moral and religious respectability. In 1840, on a visit to the Hunter River District, Broughton gave them an example of what they could hope for.
 The churches, clergy, and church-going colonists that were now developing in the Australian colonies, in contrast to previous decades of destitution, would constitute Broughton’s ‘improving inXuence’ on colonial society, albeit a society viewed (not without some reason) 39 Broughton to Sydney Diocesan SPG Committee, 24 June 1840, in SPG, Annual Report. (1841), clviii.
 as mired in convict degradation. ‘It is not reasonably to be expected that evils which have been so long accumulating, should be instant- aneously or even speedily removed.’ But in his agents of improving inXuence the ‘seeds of future improvement do exist, and are very widely scattered’ across the colonial territories. Colonial Australian society, long pictured in colonial and metropolitan imaginations as a sink of vice, was now portrayed by Broughton as containing the potential for redemption.
 One of the unfortunate consequences of a colonial bishop for the historian is that reports to the SPG from clergymen and missionaries in this period tended to be to the resident bishop, and such reports would only appear—and thus be preserved in print for us—in the published report of the society if they subsequently formed a part of the bishop’s own report. Consequently, there is less diversity among the clerical sources for the Australian colonies presented to the read- ing audience of the society’s reports than there were in the eighteenth century for the North American and Indian colonies, in which mis- sionaries corresponded with the society directly. However, Broughton did quote two of his clergy in this period, probably because they shared his view of an Australian colonial identity undergoing moral and religious improvement. However, in the Wrst instance the clergy- man’s words (it is not mentioned where he was stationed) indicated how fragile such a transformation could be if the agents of change provided by the SPG funding—that is, clergy and churches—were prevented from working their presumed inXuence upon colonial identity, which clearly suited Broughton’s agenda.
 for there is no place whither I can direct men to go, and pray to God to pardon them . . . whenever a family wishes me to oYciate, I readily comply, and have often urged it. But many Sundays I have celebrated the services of the Church at home, with no other persons present but the members of my own family. The sacrament of the Lord’s Supper has never been admi- nistered. The lower orders were struck with some dread by the addresses delivered by your Lordship [alluding to the consecration of a burial ground during a recent visitation], but in a few weeks their conscience was again dulled. I was told they knew the warnings against drunkenness were in the ‘Book’, because the Bishop said so, but they say the Clergy have put into the ‘Book’ what was not there, to serve their own purposes . . . There is not money now perhaps suYcient to complete the [church] building.41
 This comment suggests that Broughton’s ‘improving inXuence’ was not always as improving or inXuential as he portrayed it. There is a glimpse here of the beliefs of the uneducated strata of colonial society, which viewed religion as a self-serving construct of the clergy, manipulated by them for their own beneWt. These colonists alleged the clergy added to Scripture injunctions about drunkenness because that enforced their own moral agenda. But the religion of the wealthier classes in an Australian society that, from the 1820s, was increasingly Wlled with free settlers, could also at times come close to Broughton’s ideals. In 1841 the clergyman at Melbourne, A.C. Thompson, reported to Broughton on an Anglican lay initiative in the Portland district, far west of him towards the border of South Australia. There, local landowners, the Henty brothers, had assembled a congregation for Matins from the Prayer Book, with an occasional sermon read from an SPCK book. However, prior to Thompson’s visit to the area, the service had been discontinued for some months due to the brothers’ illness or absence. However, Thompson convinced one of them to revive it, and hoped he could do so until a clergyman was duly appointed to the region. Here indeed was a colonial improving inXuence from religion, and for Broughton, one that would ideally need the even more essential Anglican catalyst for colonial social change, a clergyman.42

 The missing ingredient in these SPG reports from the Australian colonies is mention of indigenous peoples. This was probably be- cause by the time Broughton arrived in New South Wales the various Aboriginal peoples had been exterminated there, deliberately or by disease, or driven to the fringes of white invasion and settlement; or they were only encountered on the moving frontiers of settlement— with similar consequences. So Australian indigenous peoples in this period are mentioned only once, in the bishop’s 1843 report, an account that was written by the chairman of his diocesan SPG committee when commenting on the bishop’s visit to the frontiers of white invasion of traditional Aboriginal lands in Victoria. Appar- ently, by the 1840s, Aboriginal people occupied less of a place in the bishop’s Anglican world than did the need for churches and clergy in white settlements. The lay chairman reported that in this Victorian region there was a white population in the interior of the colony amounting to about 9,000 persons, entirely without religious minis- trations, and with little previous contact with religion in Britain.
 From these two frontier Anglicans, there are the familiar construc- tions of an identity created for the colonizers and indigenous people that had been present in this Anglican discourse since the early days of the North American colonies in the eighteenth century. Here in the mid nineteenth-century Australian bush are the same savage, ignor- ant, degraded, and immoral heathen that Anglicans had identiWed on the North American frontier. Similarly, there were—in both locations and centuries—the religiously ignorant and indiVerent whites who were in danger in one or two generations of sliding into the same immoral heathen identity as the indigenous inhabit- ants, needing to be rescued from this un-Christian, un-English, and uncivilized identity by the ministrations and evangelism of the church. It was a comparison that occurred explicitly to the Sydney 44 Revd Edward Smith to Broughton, 13 November 1838, SPG, Annual Report (1839), 128–9.
 A public discourse on Australia by Anglican Evangelicals for like- minded consumers both at home and in the colony did not begin until an auxiliary committee of the CMSwas established in Sydney by Samuel Marsden, who became its president, in 1825. It arose because Anglicans in the colony felt their church was not doing anything about Aboriginal mission and, more particularly, because they were concerned about the growing conXict on the expanding frontier of settlement along the coast of New South Wales. In an extract of a circular published to announce its commencement, the auxiliary committee claimed they wished to prevent, in future, the des- truction of property and the loss of human life. They would do this by funding and establishing missionaries among the Aborigines ‘for the promotion of their civilization and general improvement’.46
 Obviously, to a nomadic culture like the Aborigines, the preservation of property was not a major concern, as it was to the settlers; while the committee were also concerned lest the settlers ‘extirpated’ the Aborigines. So the CMS initiative saw itself as the initiation of a mediating and moderating inXuence on the frontier, serving the interests of both parties, but with pre-existing Eurocentric cultural assumptions.
 45 Report of the Sydney Diocesan SPG Committee, ibid. (1843), 68. 46 Missionary Register, August 1825, 373.
 However, it asserted that right-thinking and conscientious people in the colony believed the Aborigines, as the original settlers in Australia, had a strong claim on Britain. ‘These Wrst possessors of the soil have the very strongest claim on those who have planted themselves on their shores.’ The committee maintained that these conscientious colonizers would ‘liberally support such eVorts as shall be made to bring them into possession of the enjoyments of civilized life and the higher blessings of Christianity’.47 This was rather gilding the lily about colonial thinking, because it was not until 1835 that there was any sort of colonial support for an Anglican mission to the Aborigines in Australia. And even then it was not colonial fundraising among the ‘conscientious’ people of the colony that made it happen, but an initiative by the imperial government.
 In 1831 the parent committee announced that the colonial secre- tary, Viscount Goderich, had directed that £500 be allocated from the revenue of New South Wales for the establishment of an Aboriginal mission. The CMS felt that they had a duty to respond to this government initiative, and ventured to explain why they thought it had occurred. Their reasons are a sample of the humanitarian thinking that was becoming predominant in British church and oYcial circles in the late 1820s until the 1840s, which climaxed in the establishment in 1835 of a parliamentary select committee, presided over by the politician and philanthropist Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, on indigenous peoples in British colonies.48
 It was not that colonization was itself wrong, but its outcomes were insuYciently connected to the propagation of Christian faith and morality. This could be rectiWed by the promotion of Christianity in the colonies and among their indigenous populations. The inculca- tion of Christianity, or ‘extending the peaceful dominion of Christ throughout the world’, was a duty upon all Christians, including oYcials such as the colonial secretary. To do so made the requisite connection between the temporal good of the state and the ‘spiritual welfare’ of those it ruled, including its indigenous ones.52
 The eventual allocation of government money made possible a CMS mission to the Wiradjuri people in the Wellington Valley of New South Wales. Although a CMS mission, it had the support of colonial Churchmen such as Thomas Scott, and his successorWilliam Broughton. Established in 1832, it was staVed by two German Lu- therans ordained in the Church of England for that mission, and an English clergymen, William Watson, and his wife Ann. The mis- sion only lasted until 1843 as it lurched between drought, Aboriginal fatalism at the impact of European diseases, the dissonance between themissionaries’message and settler sexual exploitation of Aboriginal women and girls, and acrimony between the missionaries themselves, and with the local settlers.53
 By the late 1830s, with the collapse of the Wellington Valley mission, and perhaps because of this disappointment of Bishop Broughton’s hopes of Aboriginal conversions, the growing presence in the settled areas of the colony of religiously aware and supportive white colonists—whose faith only seemed to need the invigoration of churches and clergy among them—oVered Broughton and his staV a new hope for religion in Australia. He began to speak with a new focus about the mission and future of the Church of England in his colonial context. He now aYrmed not the providential role of the English nation, but that of the Church of England itself. From this point on, Broughton determined to wrest whatever government aid he could to provide suYcient funding to ensure the future of the Church of England in Australia before that source succumbed to the liberalism of the age and was cut oV. Accordingly, he recklessly planted schools and churches in new settlements, established a colo- nial theological college, and a circulating library for his isolated clergy.58 Finally, he would inaugurate the ability of his colonial church to take action independent from the state. It was a hurried acceptance of the new Anglican imperial paradigm in the last years of his episcopate.
 But notwithstanding his growing appreciation of its futility, Broughton still retained some personal attachment to the old para- digm of the mutual support of church and state. In writing his public report to the SPG in 1838, he commented upon the support of the Van Diemen’s Land government for religion oVered to all denomin- ations, under the strictly proportional system similar to that pro- vided by the New South Wales Church Act. Broughton confessed that such a system was likely to lead to indiVerence in religion, or the idea ‘that there is in religion nothing that is either certain or true’.
 The implication behind such government support was that there was ‘no divinely instituted form of Church membership or doctrine’, Broughton complained.
 In 1842, under the new constitution for the colony that year, Broughton was oVered a place on the legislative council, but declined it, demonstrating to himself at least that by this action it was the church leaving the state and not the other way around. But he retained his place on the executive council. As far as Broughton was concerned it was still desirable that the church, in the person of the bishop, be involved in government.60With regard to education also, Broughton demonstrated a desire for the maintenance of the old paradigm, Wghting to the last for state aid for Anglican schools rather than permit the religious neutrality in this area that was by now the political preference of both colonial and imperial governments.61
 Broughton found some theological resourcing for his developing acceptance and understanding of the new Anglican paradigm for a self-governing episcopal church in the colonies in a cautious recep- tion of the writings of the Tractarians. He found their vigorous defence of the independent, divine authority of the Church of Eng- land, and particularly the doctrine of apostolic succession, a valuable replacement for his former High Church reverence for estab- lishment. Such succession involved, he thought, a transmission of spiritual authority that connected the present church with that of the apostles, and therefore with Christ, and so provided the basis for its own authority.62 But like other High Churchmen, Broughton 59 SPG, Annual Report (1838), 122–3. 60 Shaw, Patriarch and Prophet, 157. 61 Ibid., 130–1. 62 Ibid., 181.
 parted company with these Anglican radicals when the Tractarians denigrated the Protestant Reformation, and in their increasing respect for Rome as a model of Catholicism.
 It was on the basis of the English Reformation that Broughton engaged with the theme of the British Empire in a sermon in 1849.
 He reminded his congregation of the unequalled position of England at the centre of a vast system of empire, the various colonies of which gravitated towards her like a planetary system around the sun.63 This could not have happened without the Wat of providence, which sought to use that empire to extend Christ’s kingdom. Just as Christianity was inaugurated during the providentially given domi- nion of the Roman Empire, so now it would spread through the British Empire as a ‘reformed and recovered Christianity’.64 Though Reformation Christianity was debilitated by its own divisions, it was an ark that carried the treasure of spiritual freedom against the spiritual slavery of the falsity of the Roman Church. Consequently, ‘the hope of the world, I repeat, is still bound up with the cause of the Reformation, as it was undertaken and carried on within the Church of England.’65 It was still the organization that best exhibited the church as founded by Christ and as restored in the Reformation.66
 Broughton, like Archbishop Howley and Bishop BlomWeld before him, was now convinced of the need for more Anglican independ- ence from the state. In 1847 he was appalled at the rejection by the colonial secretary, Lord Grey, of the Archbishop of Canterbury’s nomination for the new see of Newcastle in New South Wales, as the Xouting of the highest ecclesiastical authority by a layman with- out the possibility of an appeal. Indeed, Grey had told Howley that in nominating colonial bishops to the crown, ‘The Secretary of State must exercise his own judgement. No right on the part of the Archbishop of Canterbury to recommend the appointment could be recognised.’ Broughton, in contrast, by this time wanted the 63 William Grant Broughton, ‘The English Reformation and the Empire of England’, in his Sermons on the Church of England, 55. 64 Ibid., 56–7. 65 Ibid., 58. 66 Ibid., 63. 67 Shaw, Patriarch and Prophet, 193.
 colonial church to be able to choose and consecrate its own bishops without beneWt of royal Letters Patent.68
 The climax of Broughton’s increasing embrace of the new para- digm of Anglican autonomy came with his achieving a conference of colonial bishops in 1850. He had been trying to get it oV the ground since 1848, when he encountered possible legal challenges to his episcopal authority to discipline his clergy for oVences outside the common law. He was further catalysed into action by his own near mortal illness, and by hearing about the decision of the Canadian bishops to confer with each other.69 He had also learned of the judgement by the judicial committee of the privy council in the Gorham case, which, in 1850, had judged as legitimate the appeal of a Calvinist parson against his bishop, who had refused to install him in a parish because he objected to the doctrine of baptismal regeneration (that is, that the action of grace automatically follows from baptism). This judgement by a secular law court over-ruled the decision of the parson’s bishop (which had previously been upheld by the highest ecclesiastical court of the Church of England) that the parson’s belief was opposed to that of the Prayer Book and therefore he could not be instituted to his nominated living. The shock of a secular court over-ruling an ecclesiastical one on a theological issue Wnally galvanized Broughton into calling a conference of the Australian bishops, and included Bishop Selwyn of New Zealand on the basis of Broughton’s own ecclesiastical authority as Metropolitan of Australasia. Broughtonwanted themeeting to be classed as a synod, a term redolent with ecclesiastical authority, despite English law out- lawing such gatherings without royal assent in the British Empire.
 According to Broughton, such royal prohibition only held so long as the crown maintained its constitutional obligation to support the Church of England, but as that had clearly lapsed, the church was freed from its obligation to uphold royal authority. As far as he was concerned, colonial synods could meet on the sole basis of the independent apostolic authority of the bishops. But in deference to the anxieties about royal authority of the Low Church Charles Perry of Melbourne, Broughton agreed to meet without any challenge to the royal supremacy, and to call the meeting a conference and not 68 Ibid., 205. 69 Ibid., 205–8, 218–30.
 a synod. But, unlike the other Australian bishops, he wanted the colonial Church of England to be entirely free of control from either Whitehall or Canterbury. He and Selwyn both sought provincial autonomy, leaving colonial Anglicanism free to make its own deci- sions, like other colonial denominations, without having to seek permission from the colonial oYce to appoint archdeacons, choose and consecrate bishops, and hold ecclesiastical councils.70 He had come a long way from the establishment archdeacon who arrived in the colony of New South Wales in 1829.
 The resulting compromise among the Australasian bishops at the 1850 meeting was an agreement to have synods of bishops and clergy decide on matters of discipline, doctrine, and worship, with concurrent conventions of laity associated with the episcopal synod in temporal matters. But the imperial government wanted to have their ecclesiastical cake and eat it too. Having ushered in the circumstances that forced the Church of England to evolve a new ecclesiastical imperial paradigm, the British government continued to shackle the colonial Church of England by the unfettered ministerial exercise of the royal supremacy, often without so much as a by-your-leave to the church. Lord Grey had just compelled the SPG to endow the diocese of Nova Scotia to avoid its suppression by the state, and then he installed his own nomination as bishop, stating to the society that it would not do to have royal ecclesiastical patronage eroded by giving a say to those who paid for the colonial Church of Eng- land.71 Propelled, in part, by this reluctance of the Whig ministry to provide the colonial Church of England with the religious freedom Whigs vaunted publicly, the new Anglican paradigm for church and empire was now embraced by Broughton and the colonial Australian church by the inauguration of its de facto synod. However, the Bishop of Melbourne informed Lord Grey that his diocese remained irrevocably committed to the authority of Canterbury in worship and doctrine, thus ending Broughton’s hopes of an autonomous Australian province.72 But, notwithstanding some of the political and legal constraints left over from the old paradigm, and the divisions within the Australian church, the new Anglican paradigm 70 Shaw, Patriarch and Prophet, 224–5. 71 Ibid., 240–1. 72 Ibid., 251.
 When Archbishop John Bird Sumner of Canterbury responded to the correspondence from the Australian bishops’ meeting by insisting that colonial synods were an illegal infringement on the royal authority, and that the bishops leave to the colonial oYce the drafting of legisla- tion for clergy discipline, Broughtonwould tarry no longer with the old paradigm, even if it was still upheld by this Evangelical archbishop.
 For Sumner, the establishment of the Church of England was non- negotiable, and he was consequently to play down claims by the colo- nial or metropolitan Anglican churches for independence.73 Not so Broughton. He left for England in 1852 determined to press the local case for synods—though theywould include,much to his own chagrin, laity as well as clergy. But he was also insistent on securing for the bishop in such synods a vote, and a veto as a separate order, with no appellate authority from the metropolitan to Canterbury, and for the bishops to meet authoritatively in provincial synod.74
 At his farewell in Sydney he gave voice to his new convictions of a church free from any suggestion of Erastianism. In his address delivered in the school room attached to the cathedral on the eve of his departure, he reminded his hearers of his purpose in making the arduous trip to England at his age. In a reference to the convo- cations of Canterbury and York suspended in the early eighteenth century, Broughton explained he was going ‘to solicit in the proper quarter, the removal of those restrictions by which our Church is at present inhibited from the free exercise of those faculties of self- guidance with which she was originally endowed’ by being able to meet in synods of bishop, clergy, and laity.75 It was, he said, fundamentally important that, if Parliament enacted such legislation, it would only be subsequent to, and enshrining the Wnding of, a 73 Edward Carpenter, Cantuar: The Archbishops and their OYce (London: Cassell, 1971), 309. 74 Shaw, Patriarch and Prophet, 252–65. 75 WilliamGrant Broughton, Farewell Address of William Grant Broughton DD Late Lord Bishop of Sydney and Metropolitan, Delivered in the School Room, Adjoining the Cathedral Church of St Andrew, in Sydney, on Saturday, the 14th August, 1852.

 church commission, in order to avoid any hint of Erastianism.
 ‘[T]hat is’, said Broughton, ‘that the State do not assume to itself the right to alter the existing laws of the Church, or to impose rules of government, unless the Church (both clergy and laity) shall have had a previous opportunity of examining into the proposed settlement, and judging whether it is fully agreeable to the law of Christ.’ Such a commission’s Wndings should also be circulated among the colonial churches for their input. This was a way of proceeding that would also ensure the fundamental doctrine and discipline of the Church of England was maintained, and that the uniformity of Anglicanismwas perpetuated throughout the empire in harmony with the Church of England and Ireland. The achievement of such a global Anglicanism, Broughton envisaged, was not just to be a divine instrument for spreading the gospel, it was requisite for the imperial destiny of the Church of England envisaged by God.76 The achievement of this autonomous and uniWed imperial Church of England would signally assist the British Empire to realize its Christian destiny, despite its often tawdry history of colonial extension.
 This, I entertain a strong hope, is part of the high destiny reserved for the Church of England by the extension of her colonial empire. It may be that the motives which often impelled the agents and instruments in that extension were worldly and sordid. In many cases, we know they were so.
 Broughton arrived in England ill and debilitated after yellow fever had raged throughout his ship, toWnd that the SPGandothers regarded him as the father of a movement for colonial autonomous episcopal churches, because he was the instigator of the bishops’ conference in 1850 whose minutes were becoming a template for other colonial churches.78While he was in England a convention of colonial bishops 76 Broughton, Farewell Address, 10. 77 Ibid., 11. 78 Shaw, Patriarch and Prophet, 267–70.
 At present, however, she is in the unhappy condition of possessing neither the substantial advantages of an established, nor the compensating freedom of a voluntary, Church.
 Now on one or other of these alternative conditions we must peremptor- ily insist. The former we know to be absolutely hopeless in the Colonies; and we claim, therefore, in the full conWdence of right, as well as with an unhesitating preference, the latter. Plainly, and in set terms, we demand that the particular religious communion, attached to the doctrine, and using the service book of the Church of England, be left at liberty in the several Colonial Dioceses to regulate its own internal order and discipline, and to manage the aVairs of its own parishes and schools, in such manner as it shall deem most conducive to God’s honour and service.79
 Broughton, however, was dead less than a month later, and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, a remarkable honour for one colo- nial Anglican warrior, who began in the ranks of the old Anglican paradigm of the church–state connection and lived to lead the charge of the colonial Anglican churches for its demise, supplanted by the new ideal of an episcopal and autonomous imperial Anglicanism.
 One of the indicators of that new paradigm in Broughton’s later life was his 1838 visit to New Zealand, which he made solely on the basis of his own episcopal authority within the Church of England, a visit that came at the instigation of the London Parent Committee of the CMS.80 Begun in 1814, the CMS mission to the Maori of New Zealand was, by the time Broughton went there, one of that society’s most successful. It had begun under the old Anglican paradigm of the exclusive partnership between church and state, and would continue into the new one of Anglican autonomous engagement with the empire. However, the CMS, formed in 1799 as a voluntary 79 Ibid., 271. 80 Missionary Register, April 1838, 221.
 society to maintain its Evangelical independence from the bishops, showed a diversity of attitudes towards church and state during this period, in addition to many of the common characteristics of the Anglican imperial discourse we have come to identify in the course of this investigation.
 the CMS sent a clergymen to the mission, and Marsden continued to make periodic visits—four up to 1823. However, developing tensions between the missionaries were solved by sending an ex-naval oYcer, the Revd Henry Williams, who became the pre-eminent Wgure of the mission, and his wife Marianne, as well as Henry’s brother William and his wife. They put the mission on a more stable basis, became Xuent in Maori and, during their control of the CMS mission in this period, developed various mission stations throughout the North Island from their eventual base in Waimate.81
 Along with settler degeneracy, anti-popery—that longstanding motif of Anglicanism since the sixteenth century, and prominent in the imperial discourse developed in eighteenth century North America—was also present in the New Zealand Anglican outlook.
 More muted in the Bengal mission due to the lack of any Roman Catholic competition there, and the greater anxieties about the athe- ism of the French Revolution in that period, anti-popery received a spur in the New Zealand mission. This was due not so much to its Evangelical outlook, since it was, as we have seen, a common Anglican note among High Churchmen as well. Rather, it was be- cause of the disturbing arrival of a competing Catholic mission in 84 Missionary Register, June 1841, 308–9. 85 Ibid., October 1842, 476. 86 Ibid., 477. 87 Ibid., June 1843, 308. 88 Ibid.
 Yet more fundamental than any of these social and psychological assessments was a theological identiWcation of the Maori as heathens.
 During the CMS mission to New Zealand there was one Wnal theme in the Anglican imperial discourse that had been among its characteristics since its North American beginnings the previous century, and that was the Anglican push for a colonial episcopate.
 Given the increasing divergences and antagonisms between High Church, Tractarians, and Evangelicals in Britain by the late 1830s and 1840s—with the Tractarians, in particular, theoretically exalting the spiritual authority of bishops—there was considerable support in this Evangelical public speaking for a bishop in New Zealand. It has already been noted that Bishop Broughton undertook his New Zealand visit to the mission there at the express invitation of the parent committee, after which the committee vaguely aYrmed that it was their hope of obtaining further divine strength through the ‘introduction of the beneWts of Ecclesiastical order’ in New Zealand.133 Broughton, of course, was in no doubt, reporting to the CMS that the Church of England required to be planted in New Zealand ‘in the full integrity of its system’, with the clergy submitting themselves ‘to regular Ecclesiastical Authority’.134 The CMS New Zealand missionaries also, in their address to Broughton at Paihia on 5 January 1839, seemed generally to have favoured the possibility.
 But the parent committee were not so delighted with the eventual episcopal advent in the new colony, when George Augustus Selwyn was consecrated the Wrst Bishop of New Zealand in 1841. In private correspondence, they advised Williams that the control of the mis- sion would remain solely in the hands of the parent committee, with the bishop being limited to ‘advice and cooperation’.138 This division between the centre and periphery of empire became increasingly contentious in later years, complicated by the theological diVerences between the Evangelical CMS and the new bishop’s modern High Church views. However, in New Zealand, the bishop and his CMS missionaries worked well together until Selwyn, in 1847, came out in support of Governor Grey’s attack on the missionaries’ land, which, though extensive, were needed to support their large families in the new country. The governor acted out of political malice towards the missionaries in order to undermine their inXuence with the Maori.
 Until then, however, the missionaries in the Weld had a common viewpoint with their bishop as to the importance of the episcopate in New Zealand.
 Selwyn was a man of the next generation to Broughton when he took up his position in the colonial Anglican Church. Consecrated bishop at the age of thirty-two, Selwyn was born in 1809, educated at Eton College, went to the conservative St John’s College, Cambridge, in 1827, and married in 1839 after his ordination some Wve years before.140 The environment of St John’s and Eton moulded him as a High Churchman, though one of a later vintage than Broughton, 135 Ibid., 550. 136 Ibid., 552. 137 Rogers, Te Wiremu, 188–90. 138 Ibid., 191–2. 139 Ibid., 239–82; Morrell, Anglican Church in New Zealand, 35–40. 140 Warren E. Limbrick, ‘A Most Indefatigable Man’, in Warren E. Limbrick (ed.), Bishop Selwyn in New Zealand 1841–68 (Palmerston North: Dunmore Press, 1983), 13–14.
 who was only too aware of the changes happening in English society and religion during the 1820s. From before he left for New Zealand Selwyn was concerned to mould the church there as one formed according to ‘true principles’. According to one historian, this left him rather Wxated when he encountered the diVerences of colonial and Maori life.141 Yet the same historian Wnds that when he left the New Zealand church in 1868 (to become Bishop of LichWeld) it was a ‘fully Xedged colonial Church organized as an ecclesiastical Province, and self-governing in its polity’.142 That he did so was largely because Selwyn was a child of the new Anglican paradigm for self-driven and autonomous ecclesiastical engagement with the empire, a model that was being formed in the Church of England at the time of his consecration. When he left for New Zealand he was more than conscious of the need to export that new Anglican self-awareness of the need for spiritual and ecclesiastical independence by the Church of England in the British Empire. Warren Limbrick agrees that Selwyn developed these principles of independence for the Church of England before he left for New Zealand, though he fails to provide any evidence from Selwyn to support this contention.143
 After the annexation of New Zealand as a crown colony, the Wrst governor, Captain William Hobson RN, was instructed by the colo- nial oYce to guarantee ‘the most absolute toleration’ to all religious denominations. Selwyn, in their view, was to be bishop only of the Church of England settlers, and to have no oYcial support beyond that.144 But the colonial government did make provision for Selwyn’s salary, as that of other Anglican clergy in their capacity as colonial chaplains in various colonies, though this arrangement soon lapsed under pressure from colonial legislatures, which developed quickly in the 1850s and were disposed towards religious equality.145 Once in New Zealand, Selwyn sought to work cooperatively with govern- ment, provided always that this did not threaten the autonomy of the Church of England in the colony. In a letter to the Tractarian lawyer James Hope-Scott, Selwyn commented on the failure of 141 Limbrick, ‘A Most Indefatigable Man’, 16. 142 Ibid., 20. 143 Warren E. Limbrick, ‘Transformation and Tradition: Bishop Selwyn and Angli- can Foundations’, in Limbrick, Bishop Selwyn, 25. 144 Ibid., 29–30. 145 Ibid., 30–1.
 Hobson’s 1842 Church Extension Ordinance to be upheld by the imperial government, and so provide government subsidies equally to all denominations. ‘I have little doubt of securing the Church upon permanent endowments so as to be altogether independent both of assistance from home, and from local Government’, he wrote, but he would not accept such government assistance if it meant admitting that the Church of England was just the same as other denominations.146 Limbrick suggests that Selwyn was confused in his theology, because this was never his strong point, and because he was living on the cusp of a new church–state reality in the colonies, with their growing culture of religious equality. According to Limbrick, only after the 1850 bishops’ conference called by Broughton was Selwyn entirely clear about calling for an entire separation of church and state in New Zealand.147
 Yet Selwyn, who arrived in New Zealand in 1842, called his Wrst synod of clergy on his own episcopal authority to meet at his residence in Waimate just two years later, in 1844. Their purpose was to discuss rules and government for the church in New Zealand.148
 Selwyn clearly referred to this gathering as a diocesan synod, able to act decisively by making and revising its own canons, which then only awaited a determination of their authority from a more repre- sentative gathering of the clergy of the whole diocese. Already in 1842, therefore, he was exhibiting none of Broughton’s hesitancy about this move.149 Against English criticism that he was Xying the face of the royal supremacy, he explained his actions to friends there as anti-Erastian.
 My desire is, in this country, so far as God may give me light and strength, to try what the actual system of the Church of England can do, when disencumbered of its earthly load of seats in parliament, Erastian compro- mises, corruption of patronage, confusion of orders, synodless bishops, and an unorganised clergy. None of these things are inherent in our system, and therefore not to be imposed as faults.150
 This suggests none of the lack of clarity about the nature of the colonial Church of England that Limbrick claims Selwyn exhibited until 1850. A second synod was called in 1847 in Auckland, to which Selwyn gave an extended charge that he regarded as his most important statement of principles to be delivered after he had gained suYcient experience of the country.151 He spent most of the charge calling his few clergy to avoid all expressions and impressions of disunity on matters of doctrine, as being seriously harmful to their missionary work, and urged unity among them based on the Bible and the Prayer Book. But at the beginning of the charge he mentioned his hopes for the Church of England in New Zealand.
 He believed synods in the Church of England, in the form of convo- cation, had been suspended for so long because they had lost their spiritual character and became mere political assemblies. However, in New Zealand, freed from a connection to the state, and in a primitive colonial context, there was good reason to believe such synods could be revived. It was important to avoid, on the one side, an overween- ing sense of self-importance, and on the other, the ‘no less fatal error of servility to the ruling powers of the State’.152
 He did believe that the colonization of New Zealand had resulted in two great achievements. It brought humanitarian legislation to- wards the Maori by the state, and, for the church, the episcopal principle from the very beginning of the country’s colonization, because ‘in a new colony the Church ought to be planted at once in all the integrity of its system’.154 New Zealand could become a mission centre for the South PaciWc, he believed, so long as it had a settled form of episcopal government that was ‘unfettered by connexion with the State’, and free to call its own synods.155
 Towards the end of his charge Selwyn again made somemention of the place of the Church of England at home and in the colonies, as part of his concern for the implementation of an eVective system of moral and ecclesiastical discipline in the new colonial church. Angli- can discipline had lapsed and become distorted, he felt, by the church’s alliance with the state. As a consequence, discipline intended for moral reformation of its members had become the imposition of uniformity supported by the force of secular law. It was a product of ‘this false alliance with the civil power’ that it was important to avoid in the New Zealand context, where discipline should rely only on the force of Christian morality and ‘the inherent power of the Church’.156
 Selwyn concluded this Wrst charge to his clergy by urging the accomplishment of a ‘comprehensive system of church polity’ in New Zealand. By this he explained that the episcopate was not meant to be monarchical over the clergy, but cooperative with them.157 But neither could the clergy act without the bishop, and in cases of doubt the Wnal arbiter was the Archbishop of Canterbury.
 As a result, Selwyn set out what he believed were the powers of their diocesan synod, which were to advise the bishop, refer appeals to the archbishop, and develop their own diocesan government.
 principles for a constitution for the Church of England in New Zealand. In keeping with his statements of the 1840s, in this letter Selwyn clearly understood that the Church of England in the colonies should not depend on the state connection. It was required to be autonomous, and indeed voluntarist, and its state connection in England could not, and should not, apply in the empire. What had taken Broughton two decades to arrive at, Selwyn had already implemented as purely clerical synods just two years after arriving in New Zealand, and within a decade was proposing to extend this synodical principle to embrace the whole church—bishop, clergy, and laity.
 The necessity of this measure arises mainly from two causes: First, that the Church in this colony is not established by law, and consequently that a large portion of the ecclesiastical law of England is inapplicable to us; Secondly, that the Church in this colony is dependent mainly upon the voluntary contributions of its members . . .We can scarcely expect that such a revision of the ecclesiastical law as would meet our wants will be undertaken in England, because the Convocation of the clergy is no longer allowed to meet for deliberation, and the British parliament is no longer composed only of members of the Church . . . It follows, therefore, that we must either be content to have no laws to guide us, or that we must apply for the usual power granted to all incorporated bodies—to frame by-laws for ourselves in all such matters as relate to our own peculiar position, reserving to Her Majesty and to the heads of the Church in England such rights and powers as may be necessary to maintain the Queen’s supremacy, and the unity and integrity of our Church.159
 It might be thought that in maintaining the royal supremacy Selwyn was not fully committed to relinquishing the state connec- tion. But he clearly saw no role in the discipline, doctrine and government of this colonial Anglican Church for a British Parlia- ment, or a metropolitan government that was no longer exclusively Anglican. His reference is to the crown—the monarch—alone. This is in the manner of traditional High Church theology, which viewed the crown as a sacred and separate oYce from Parliament and the crown’s ministers; as a genuinely Anglican monarchy exercising, by virtue of the royal coronation oath, a lay but genuinely Anglican 159 Evans, Churchman Militant, 139–40.
 supremacy over the church.160 But since the constitutional revolution this authentic Anglican royal supremacy was no longer applicable to either Parliament or the crown’s ministers. Overriding all was Selwyn’s concern for the unity and integrity of the Church of England in the empire, so that he was willing to give a share in its colonial government to the ecclesiastical heads of the church in England, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the monarch in its ecclesiastical person as Head of the Church of England, but no longer to Parliament and politicians.
 His General Principles were essentially proposing that the church in New Zealand be governed by its three orders—bishops, clergy, and laity—meeting in a general convention, whose decisions were Wnal and abiding on members of the church, and were reached by each of these three orders voting separately.161 Selwyn was inXuenced in these principles by constitutional developments in the Episcopal Church in the United States.162 But he also wanted to maintain a truly Anglican royal supremacy and union with the Church of Eng- land. Accordingly, he proposed that meetings of clergy and laity agree on a draft constitution to send to the Archbishop of Canterbury and the secretary of state for the colonies in order that they sponsor an Act of Parliament to permit the New Zealand church to ‘frame laws for its own government’.163 The legal position of the church in New Zealand needed to be secure, and that required an act of the imperial Parliament, though it was clear that Parliament would only legally enable what the church was in process of realizing anyway. At a reasonably representative meeting of the clergy and laity of New Zealand Anglicans in Auckland, in May 1857, a draft constitution was agreed, with six fundamental provisions. The Church of New Zealand would: Hold and maintain the Doctrine and Sacraments of christ as the lord hath commanded in his holy word, and as the United Church of England and Ireland hath received and explained the same in the Book of 160 Peter Nockles, The Oxford Movement in Context: Anglican High Churchman- ship, 1760–1857 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 50–3. 161 Evans, Churchman Militant, 140–1. 162 Hans Cnattingius, Bishops and Societies: A Study of Anglican Colonial and Missionary Expansion, 1698–1850 (London: SPCK, 1952), 203. 163 Evans, Churchman Militant, 141.
 By the mid-nineteenth century English and colonial Anglicans still saw such a task as being their peculiar duty, because of God’s unique and wonderful exaltation of their nation imperially. Britain was still providentially purposed and imperially endowed by God to diVuse the gospel globally. For the Bishop of Chichester, though, the problem was that most Britons remained stubbornly unaware of the divine responsibility conferred by the fact ‘that this country has been spe- cially selected, and endowed by Providence, as an instrument for suVusing knowledge and civilization and social happiness throughout the world’.167 The vast charge of empire that God had entrusted to Britain brought with it corresponding responsibilities for individuals and the nation, according to Charles Longley, Bishop of Ripon (and later Archbishop of Canterbury) in 1841. The earliest Christians beneWted from the Roman Empire facilitating the spread of their 164 Evans, Churchman Militant, 144. 165 Thomas Musgrave, Bishop of Hereford, A Sermon, xxvi. 166 Ibid., xxvii. 167 Philip Shuttleworth, Bishop of Chichester, A Sermon (1840), xxx.
 While heathens remained in a moral and religious darkness, the settlers were still not much better in the view of these metropolitan Anglicans. Colonists, according to the Bishop of Chichester in 1840, were full of faithlessness and ingratitude towards their mother coun- try because of the lack of religion among them, which was also the cause of settler cruelty and rapacity towards the native populations.
 The retention of these older themes in imperial Anglican discourse into the mid nineteenth century points to continuities in Anglican imperialism, alongside the instigation of a new Anglican paradigm of imperial engagement. The resistance of Archbishop Sumner to the prospect of an independent Anglican Church in New Zealand, and to the revival of convocations in the Church of England as threatening to the establishment of his church, also indicates that not all Anglicans felt comfortable with changes in that vision.171 Broughton in Australia took some decades before he felt able to embrace it willingly and proactively, whereas the younger Selwyn’s de facto calling of gatherings of clergy—which he believed were genuine synods—from the start of his colonial episcopate pointed to the future. It was an ecclesiastical and imperial future supported by the more energetic and reformist elements of the Church of England, 168 Charles Longley, Bishop of Ripon, A Sermon (1841), xxix. 169 Musgrave, Sermon, xxvii. 170 Shuttleworth, Sermon, xxx–xxxi, xxxviii. 171 Carpenter, Cantuar, 308–9.
 such as BlomWeld and Gladstone. To these metropolitan and colonial Anglicans the establishment of the Church of England, with its mutual obligations on church and state, was eVectively dead follow- ing the political changes of 1828 to 1832, and the Church of England consequently needed a new way forward. Now, imperially engaged Anglicans began to implement a colonial episcopal church regarded as requisite, in an increasingly self-directed and self-governing church in the empire, and at home.
 Frances Knight has drawn attention to the way in which this new denominational identity was shaped within England, through a narrowing of its support base and a deWning of its spirituality, to which the laity made a gradual but uneasy adjustment that enabled the Church of England to remain a powerful force in the lives of the English and their society.172 However, a further factor in this denominational redeWnition of the nineteenth-century Church of England was the empire. The imperative of colonial church extension, consequent upon the state relinquishing its revived commitment to Anglicanism in the empire in the late 1820s, saw the Church of England in the 1840s, both in the imperial centre and by bishops at the colonial periphery, devise a new Anglican paradigm that recreated Anglicanism around a requisite episcopacy and an ability for self-determination. So Anglican redeWnitionwas notmerely a process reactively entered into in response to external changes, but proactively embraced from within.
 The empire was still largely understood in a way that was continuous with the previous century: as being providentially bestowed for the purposes of evangelism, populated with religiously debased colonists and heathen living under the darkness of Satan, and needing to be held together by religion—that is, Christianity (that is, the Church of England). But now that church was diVerent in this Anglican con- struction, even if the empire was not. From the 1840s there was an irreversible dawn of a new Anglicanway of being a church in the empire with regard to its self-understanding, its relationship with the state, and its polity in the colonies. However, much of the Anglican discourse in relation to the colonial populations or colonized and colonizing peoples remained, in the Wrst half of the nineteenth century, very much within the same theological framework it had developed in the century before.
 It seems almost tautological to aYrm that Anglicans who engaged with the English–British Empire did so primarily from a position of belief and, asmost of themwere clergy, from a perspective of theology.
 In understanding the English–British Empire religiously they con- structed their world in a series of theological polarities. The most fundamental of these was a religious division between Christian and 1 I have, for example, interpreted Anglican religion in this way—as one manifest- ation of its social consequences—in my article ‘An Antipodean Establishment: Institutional Anglicanism in Australia, 1788–c.1934’, Journal of Anglican Studies, 1 (2003), 61–90.
 More particularly, this theological construction of Christian belief as a lense through which to understand the empire was devised within the traditions and life of the Church of England. Until the 1840s, that church maintained and valued its subordinate partnership with the state, which it understood to be an Anglican political com- munity for which it had the religious and moral responsibility. That politico-theological understanding was a major ingredient in what I have called the old imperial paradigm for Anglican engagement with the empire, which lasted throughout the eighteenth century, and until the state moved away from it in the constitutional revolution of 1828–32. Also during that period the Church of England (and the Anglicans studied here) thought of itself as the best of all possible churches, reformed in the Protestant Reformation so that it was the denomination most closely resembling the primitive church of the Wrst centuries. This ecclesiological understanding formed another component of Anglican self-conWdence, which never questioned their self-proclaimed responsibility to bring Christianity in its Church-of- England form to the colonized and colonizers in the empire.
 This Anglican self-congratulation had its imperial foil throughout this period in the Roman Catholic Church, commonly regarded by Anglicans at the antithesis of their own gospel and ecclesiastical purity.
 Based on a theological antagonism dating back to the sixteenth-century Reformation, which maintained that Catholicism was a spurious and Satanic masquerade for true Christianity, it also had its roots in an Anglican sense of inferiority about the older, and often eVective, missionary engagement of their rivals. Exacerbated, therefore, when- ever Anglican missions had to actually compete with the presence of Roman Catholicism in a colonial context, Anglicans saw their work as a major bulwark against the possibility that the empire would become less Christian and less British through Catholic evangelization.
 was aYrmed from the beginnings of the SPG in 1701, and was still being upheld by other Anglicans before a parliamentary select committee in 1837.
 the divine providential ruling of it, was a major theological under- standing of the empire from the very Wrst, among those SPG Anglicans involved in North America from 1701, then on through the Evangelical andHigh Church Anglicans in Bengal at the turn of the century, and to Australia and New Zealand more than a century after the inauguration of the SPG.
 It is true that the enduring Anglican expression of the ancient Christian belief in providence was given a renewed boost by Evan- gelical Anglican missions from the early nineteenth century.6 How- ever, that imperial providentialism, focused for these Anglicans on God’s favourite church, the Church of England, was being publicly proclaimed long before the rise of Evangelicalism in the later eighteenth century. An Anglican theological and ecclesiastical vision of empire did exist throughout the eighteenth century in the public statements, reports, and sermons of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. The later, more well known, Evangelical British views of empirewere very similar in content to this earlier construction.
 That similarity, therefore, suggests that the later Anglican Evangelical outlooks made reference to the earlier non–Evangelical imperial discourse for the formulation of their own engagement with empire and missions when that began from the 1790s onwards. So the theo- logical discourse that had been constructed by SPG preachers and North American missionaries during the eighteenth century became an Anglican imperial meta-narrative that survived in large part throughout the century and a half of this study because it was largely upheld by Anglicans of most theological persuasions. It not only generalized about England–Britain’s premier providential imperial place in the scheme of divine salvation, but also about how identities were constructed in the English–British Empire.
 Native Americans, the Bengalis, or the Australian Aborigines. How- ever, all of these indigenous peoples in the colonies, as heathens, were subjects of the dominion of Satan, while colonists were always in peril of also sliding into Satan’s rule through religious indiVerence or degeneration. But this identity of either group was not ontologically Wxed. Their condition could be reversed through evangelism, produ- cing conversion in the case of the latter, or re-evangelism in the former, in the same way that English identity had been raised from a similar dark and debased condition in their history when the Christian gospel had converted the heathen Anglo-Saxons. The possibility of such a theological alteration of colonial or of indigenous identity pointed to the contemporary role of the Church of England in the English–British Empire, which was to eVect a similar moral and spiritual elevation of indigenes and colonists to what had occurred in English history, by providing these peoples with the Christian gospel according to the Church of England, the best of all possible Christian worlds.
 In that respect the SPG, the CMS, and the Church of England in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were undoubtedly imperialist but, I have arguedhere, for genuinely and thoroughly religiousmotives.
 For example, the powerfulHenryVenn, secretary of the CMS,while still an imperialist in the sense of being willing to use the resources of the British Empire for his society’s ends, also believed that his church’s establishment placed it under undesirable constraints in that imperial setting, compared with other churches.
 The unfavourable contrast may be explained by the fact that other de- nominations are accustomed to take part in the elementary organization of their Churches at home, and therefore more readily carry out that organ- ization in the Missions. Whereas in our Church the Clergy Wnd everything relating to elementary organisation settled by the Law of the Land:—as in the provision of tithes, of church-rates, of other customary payments, in the constitution of parishes, and in parish oYcers, our Clergy are not prepared for the question of Church organisation.8
 Cox maintains that this ability to understand the imperial diYculties for his church in acting independently was a consequence of Venn, as a voluntarist committed to religious freedom, being able to look at his church more objectively and understand its deWciencies. But then, as this study has shown, so also did the non-voluntarist High Church and non-Evangelical Anglicans who were the SPG’s preachers in the eighteenth century, who also chafed under some of the legal and political constraints of the state connection with regard to a colonial episcopate. So also did Broughton, Selwyn, and BlomWeld, and others in the established church in the nineteenth century, who ultimately opted to act in a voluntarist fashion to achieve that satisfactory colonial episcopate. Unlike Venn, whose answer was the formation of a native church before a local episcopate,9 these Anglicans maintained that, as Anglicanism was fundamentally episcopal, such a colonial or native church could not be completely itself without a bishop. Hence 8 Ibid., 365. 9 Ibid, 366.
 their advocacy of colonial Anglican churches in their ‘full integrity’, with an episcopate from as close to their colonial beginnings as practicable.
 In that sense they had maintained in the Anglican imperial discourse of the nineteenth century a trope of their eighteenth-century predeces- sors.ThediVerencewas that, by the1840s, this fundamental episcopalian identity for an imperial Anglicanism was more readily achievable once the Church of England had adopted a new self-directing identity, initi- ated at themetropolitan centre, and takenup also in the colonial periph- eries, which no longer looked to the old paradigm of a partnership with the state, which had prevailed until then.
 Anglicanism during this period was imperialist if by that is meant that the Church of England in the colonies was enmeshed with the social, political, and economic realities of colonial inequalities of power between colonizers and colonized. It was probably historically diYcult for an established church not to be collusive with imperial power—though it is clear that, inNorthAmerica at least, its established position put it at a disadvantage compared with other denominations when it came to instituting its own preferred ecclesiastical government in the face of the local power of lay elites who disliked the idea, or metropolitan political ones who found it inexpedient.
 However, a comparison of the critical attitudes towards the English– British state of the SPG preachers and missionaries on the issue of a colonial episcopate, with the myopia with which they approached the oppression and power diVerentials of slavery, reminds us that such critical conditionality in their imperial enthusiasm was muted and seriously Xawed when it concerned these Anglicans coming to grips realistically with colonial inequalities that they felt were outside the direct ecclesiastical interests of the Church of England, very narrowly deWned.
 They were also imperialist in that they applied to the empire their domestic agenda of the Church of England as constituting the moral and social unity of the nation. Just as the nation needed to be preserved in peace and good order by the bond of Christianity epitomized in the Church of England, so this long-standing sense of national mission was exported to the empire. There also the Church of England consti- tuted the best chance for the inculcation and promotion of imperial unity. These Anglicans drew a lesson from the failure of the state to promote Anglicanism in the ultimately rebellious North American colonies and, consequently, they promulgated the imperial usefulness of Anglicanism. As this imperial bond was based on the divinely given and directed Church of England, so a British Empire whose inhabitants, indigenous and colonial, were born and bred in that church would have a share in the God-given promises of endurance and perpetuity given to the church. Only this religious basis for social unity, both at home and abroad, had any real chance of permanence in this world.
 religion in Enlightenment culture. This maintenance of customary English religion in the Enlightenment within England may have been a major ingredient in the successful spread of Enlightenment culture that is too often overlooked by historians. Recent historical research has pointed to the continuing popularity of the Church of England at home in this period, rather than its supposed decline.11
 Cries of ‘the Church in danger’, for example, were able to harness considerable popular support, from the Sacheverell case under Queen Anne, at least until the anti-Catholic Gordon riots in the 1780s, and in the ‘Church and King’ riots against Dissenters in the next decade.
 The anxiety expressed by the Anglicans in this study about either (or both) Catholicism and Dissent gaining ground in the empire in the early eighteenth century, and as late as Archbishop Howley at the 1841 public meeting to inaugurate the Colonial Bishoprics Fund, suggests that the promotion of imperial concerns among their Anglican constituency may have had much to do with the old pre-Enlightenment battle with these two religious opponents moving out from England to the empire. The eighteenth century was certainly one of intellectual ferment, but this Anglican imperial discourse suggests that more of the discursive development that took place had continuity with traditional religious outlooks than is often allowed by historians of what is commonly regarded as the High Enlightenment.
 But there were also fundamental changes alongside these Anglican imperial continuities, which saw new assertive emphases on episcopacy, self-determination, and self-governance emerge in metropolitan and colonial Anglicanism in the mid nineteenth century. An insistence on the necessity of episcopacy in colonial churches, and a determination by the Church of England to institute it in Anglicanism’s engagement with the British Empire, were enshrined in formal documents at home and abroad in the 1840s and 1850s, in connection with the Colonial Bishoprics Fund established by the church acting unilaterally and autonomously, and only afterwards enshrining that action in new parliamentary legislation. In the case of British colonies, this 11 Jeremy Gregory, Restoration, Reformation, and Reform, 1660–1828: Archbishops of Canterbury and theirDiocese (Oxford:ClarendonPress, 2000);W.M. Jacob,LayPeople and Religion in the Early Eighteenth Century (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996).
 new Anglican episcopal forwardness was found in the ecclesiastical constitutions of colonial Anglican churches from the mid nineteenth century. Both in the centre and the peripheries of empire, Anglican leaders—bishops, clergy, and laity—initiated and accepted these two thrusts of a new Anglican engagement in empire and in Anglican self-identity. However, the establishmentarian attitude of Archbishop Sumner in opposing them warns us against any simplistic theory of replacement of one paradigm with another. There was something new in Anglican attitudes to empire and to its own colonial self- deWnition from the 1840s, but it continued to exist and develop alongside older establishment attitudes of the church and state in partnership, and alongside older tropes of an Anglican construction of the English–British nation that derived from the early eighteenth century. This was so even in Australia, which was, as we have seen, a major site of the initiation of the new imperial paradigm under Broughton; but under his successors, more often than not, there was a continued upholding of the old church–state paradigm in these colonies long past its use-by date.12
 With regard to episcopacy, the new paradigm of a self-determining and fundamentally episcopal Anglicanism extended to the empire the same episcopal identity, regarded as essential and non-negotiable, that had already been realized in the Church of England in 1662.
 In 1660 the moderate restoration of the Church of England, envisaged as a revised episcopalianism in a negotiated settlement with moderate presbyterianism (a dominant force during the Commonwealth and Protectorate), and enshrined in the Worcester House Declaration of October 1660, quickly became defunct. It was killed oV by, amongother things, a revitalized grassroots Anglicanism expressed in enthusiasm for the Prayer Book and for episcopal ordination by aspiring clergy- men; by gentry welcoming the return of the old, known order; and by episcopalians becoming more militant in Parliament. This resulted in the ‘Cavalier Parliament’ passing the Act of Uniformity that made episcopal ordination absolutely requisite for ministry in the Church of England—a view enshrined in the Prayer Book of 1662. It resulted in the nonconformity of some 1,700 ministers to the restored, episcopal 12 Strong, ‘An Antipodean Establishment’, passim.
 Church of England.13 From the 1840s, that same episcopalianism became also, for the Anglicans studied here, either an essential or, at least a vitally important, part of the identity of colonial Anglicanism.
 Anglicanism, in the form of the institutional Church of England, the Anglican missionary societies, and their supporters, was institu- tionally, consciously, evangelistically, and organizationally connected and concerned with the English–British Empire since the beginning of the eighteenth century. To be so, Anglicanism needed to under- stand the empire religiously as a theological missionary imperative, a discourse it framed quite early on in the context of the colonies of North America. This discourse remained remarkably consistent throughout the next century and half, despite Anglicanism’s engage- ment with a diversity of colonial contexts, indigenous peoples and cultures, and penal and free colonists in North America, India, Austra- lia, andNewZealand. TheAnglican engagement, and how it framed the empire, clashed with its cultures, and provided imperial purpose—as well as oppressive constructions and blindnesses—in that imperial commitment is, fundamentally, the history of the construction and persistence of a theological discourse. It is a reminder of how religion in this period was vital and inXuential to a substantial section of the British people, and that through the framework of this religion they understood, for better or worse, their empire and the peoples who populated it.

But the characteristic contribution of Maryland to  the' English colonisation was the frank acceptance of toleration  in religious opinions. Lord Baltimore was a Catholic, and in  Maryland Catholics and Protestants lived in a harmony un­ known to the Old World. This distinction, not less than the  general type of government, the character of its cultivation,  slavery and the interposition of the Dutch, effectually severed  Maryland from the Puritan colonies of the north.

 face, in middle life, the hardships of a pioneer in New England.  He and his companions were alike Puritans, drawn mainly  from the Eastern counties, and it was not concealed that  settlers of milder views would find scant welcom~. Some  amongst them were, like Endicott, men of fierce uncom­ promising convictions with whom a question of Church order  or Biblical controversy was the chief concern of life.

 THE LOSS OF THE AMERICAN COLONIES.
 I. The chief of these lay in the origin and history of the  colonies themselves. The colonists were, as we have seen,  above all things Englishmen, With the political tenacity and  individual reliance of their race. In fighting George III.,  New England at least felt itself once more resisting the  tyranny of the Stuarts. Moreover, thanks to their long training  in self-government in Church and State, and to their steady  prosperity, the colonial communities were, politically, far more  intelligent apd advanced than the mother country, and their  leaders were conscious of it.

 The Catholic Church had, as we have seen, proved itself not  a. The Ro- merely a religious but a political power in Canada.
 The second period of Canadian history begins with the  Quebec Act of 1774. By this Act Roman Second Catholicism was recognised as the religion of the   period of Anglo-Cana­colony, and the parochial clergy were allowed dian rule: the  to "hold, receive and enjoy their accustomed Quebec Act, 1774·dues and rights, with respect to such persons  only as shall profess the said religion." In civil matters the  existing French law was continued in force; criminal charges  were to be decided by an English code. Colonial government  was, as before, to be administered by a . nominated Council.  English opinion could not then rise to the idea of a legislative  Assembly which must be, under the circumstances, exclusively  Catholic. England, as we know, admitted toleration in the  colonies long in advance of its recognition at home; but the The Loyalist Immigration. [CH. VIII.
 The constitution of 1791 was, however, the first step towards  colonial autonomy. It preserved the rights previously conceded  to the French population and placed the English settlers in an  equal position with them. Upper Canada could thus protect  its Protestant worship, support its clergy, and adopt a system  of freehold land-tenure; and this it proceeded to do. Lower  Canada retained, with its French language, its own civil and  religious institutions. England in this way recognized that  Canada contained two nations, which could not as yet amalga­ mate; and devised a constitution to meet their distinctive  needs.
 But the colonial authorities at home, reflecting perhaps  Reversal of English Liberal opinion as a whole, were at the Kaffir this time (1836) averse to any measures which  Settlement, 1836. seemed to increase British responsibilities.

 Fundamental variations in church architecture also accorded with denomina- tional di�erence. Christianity in early modern Britain was divided into distinct  groups: the Protestant Church of England (or Anglicans), Roman Catholics,  and nonconformist Protestant groups who broke away from the Church of  England, such as Puritans, Quakers, and Methodists. Within Britain, religious  a�liation and dissent were the source of political and cultural con�ict, and  British colonial history is as much delineated by the migration of religious  groups from Britain caught up in these troubles as it is by trade or war with  foreign powers.
 Churches also played a significant role in imperialist activities that took place  within Britain in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In Scotland, following  the religious conflict that underpinned the Jacobite Uprising (1745–6), with the  Highland clans supporting the Catholic Stuarts over the Protestant Hanoverians, 32 See L. P. Nelson, The Beauty of Holiness: Anglicanism and Architecture in Colonial South Carolina  (Chapel Hill, 2009).
 https://www.flickr.com/photos/billread/449558802/ https://www.flickr.com/photos/billread/449558802/ the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK), funded the  construction  of Protestant, Church of Scotland, churches and schools—often in a single, multi- purpose structure—throughout the Highlands in the later eighteenth century.  �is programme of church building was intended to ‘civilize’ the mostly Roman  Catholic Gaelic population. �e presence of these plain geometric buildings in the  Highland landscape was deeply signi�cant.
 In Ireland, as part of the programme of plantations in the seventeenth century,  Protestantism was forced upon the Roman Catholic population through the con- �scation of all lands and buildings belonging to the Catholic Church. All Irish  churches, dating from the medieval period to the seventeenth century, were recast  as ‘Church of Ireland’ (the name for the Anglican church in Ireland). For example,  the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Dublin has been the seat of the Church of  Ireland since the sixteenth century. However, the church itself dates from the  twelfth century and therefore was the seat of the Roman Catholic Church in  Ireland for over four hundred years. By the eighteenth century, new churches were  built to re�ect the wealth and taste of the Anglo-Irish establishment. In Dublin,  the centre of Anglo-Irish culture, the work of neoclassical architect John Smyth is  prominent, as seen, for example, in the pedimented portico of St Catherine’s  (1760–9) (see Figure  5.4) and the interior of St Werburgh’s (1754). At both  churches, in a direct act of colonial image-making, Smyth’s task was to classicize, Figure 1.12. St Mary’s Church, Madras (1680–1795) (Sylvia Murphy).
 �e other major attempt at perpetuating this urban planning tradition in British  North America was the city of Savannah, in the Province of Georgia (Georgia  Colony), developed in 1734 by soldier and Jacobite sympathizer, James Oglethorpe.7  Oglethorpe, who was ably assisted in his endeavour to promote the colony of  Georgia by John Perceval, founded his idea on the traditional notion that Britain’s  overseas colonies were places where the less savoury yet conscientious and able in  British society ought to be sent to ‘improve’ themselves—in e�ect, social dumping  grounds. Given its proximity to Spanish Florida, the colony was also intended to  serve as a territorial bu�er between the existing Spanish and established English  colonies on the eastern seaboard of the North American continent, with many of its  new settlers envisaged as ‘farmer-soldiers’.
 �e marked di�erences in the plan for Annapolis raise obvious questions about  the correlation between urban planning and visions of social and political order.  Francis Nicholson (1655–1728) was a royal governor, a member of the Royal Society  (which had also claimed Wren and Evelyn among its ranks), and an unabashed  monarchist. His extension of an aristocratic social and political structure with a Figure 2.5. ‘A Ground Plat of the City and Port of Annapolis’ (Maryland) by James  Stoddert (1743) (Collection of the Maryland State Archives).

 RELIGION, ARCHITECTURE, AND EARLY  COLONIZ ATION: THE FIRST TWO CENTURIES �e half century between the Restoration in 1660 and the rise of the Hanoverians  in 1714 included an important sequence of events that turned attention to the  challenge of church construction, especially Protestant church construction, both  in England and across the English (later British) colonial world. �e restoration of  the episcopacy in 1660 opened the door to an intensive wave of church inspection  and repair across England after twenty years of neglect. If the Diocese of York is  any indication, more than half of England’s churches required and received some  repair in the latter decades of the seventeenth century.4 Indeed, despite Victorian  aspersions of neglect, the regular maintenance of churches was a continued prac- tice through the eighteenth century.5 �e great London �re of 1666 launched a  massive church building and rebuilding campaign in that city that would last into  the early years of the eighteenth century. At around this time, on 16 June 1701  to  be precise, King William III issued a Royal Charter to the Society for the  T.

 Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) to commission and send minis- ters to England’s colonial territories in America, including the West Indies.6 �e  in�ux of ministers that resulted triggered a wave of church building across the  colonies. In 1710 Queen Anne signed an act for the building of �fty new churches  in the cities of London and Westminster, largely as a response to rapid population  growth after the Great Fire. While few of these were built, they provided models  for city churches across the empire. In addition, she established the Board of the  First Fruits in 1711, funded by a tax on clerical incomes, as a means to assist the  Church of Ireland to build new Protestant churches and glebe houses among  Ireland’s majority Catholic population (see Chapter 1, p. 41).7 �roughout this  period, Anglicans built new churches in places ranging from Ireland to New England  and the Caribbean, although the greatest concentrations were in the colonies of  Virginia, South Carolina, and Jamaica.8 �us, the late seventeenth and early eight- eenth centuries were a fruitful age for church construction in England and its  empire.
 Conditions in the colonies, of course, were di�erent from those in England.  During the seventeenth century, the Church of England had functioned as the  state church in a number of England’s colonial territories. �ese included Virginia  on the North American mainland, and Barbados, St Christopher, and Jamaica in  the West Indies. In Ireland Anglicanism was instituted as the state religion through  the concomitant Church of Ireland (est. 1536). As local representatives of the state  church, Anglican parishes became political districts, and Anglican vestries were  given the responsibility of ensuring regular worship in the parish church and car- ing for the poor.9 But the in�ux of new priests funded by the SPG bolstered  Anglican worship and political authority. �e Church of England became the state  church in Maryland and South Carolina by legislation in 1702 and 1706 respec- tively. While Anglicans were present and active throughout the more northerly  colonies on the North American mainland, the church was not established as a  state church in the same way that it was further south. Given the absence of any  bishops in colonial places, all American colonial parishes fell under the jurisdiction  of the Bishop of London. In many of these places, one of the stated responsibilities  of the  colonial church—at least in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centu- ries—was to concentrate on the conversion of ‘natives’: Native Americans on the  American mainland, Africans in the American South and the West Indies, and 6 On the SPG, see D.

 native (Catholic) Irish in Ireland. �e Anglican Church was inextricably linked  with the project of empire.
 Furthermore, the social, cultural, and political complexity of Britain’s empire  also meant that colonies claimed populations of other religious adherents. �e  colonies therefore abounded with congregations of non-Anglicans, the greatest  concentration of which were to be found in New England. �e New England  meeting-house, for example, is a distinctive building type that emerged from the  settlement of religious dissidents and refugees as they made their way to the ‘new  world’ to establish colonies of their own. Moreover, in certain parts of the British  empire, especially Ireland and Quebec, Roman Catholicism was the predominant  denomination. As we shall see, this had architectural consequences of its own.  Social and professional networks were also drawn upon in constructing these com- peting visions of the New Jerusalem, where congregations of believers (Quakers  and Jews among then) found themselves in regular communication with one  another, not just within individual colonies but right across the British world,  fostering very particular concepts of identity and experience.
 Beginning with Anglicanism, we �nd that ecclesiastical buildings erected by  adherents of the Church of England across the English (and then British) empire  varied quite widely in plan and appearance. Yet, as Nigel Yates has shown, the  majority of Anglican churches defaulted to a conservative tradition that espoused  the material distinction of the church interior into two chambers: a nave for ordi- nary service and a chancel for the celebration of the sacrament.0 At least one-third  (but more likely something closer to one-half ) of all churches newly erected across  England in this era took this form, achieved either through a narrow, deep chancel  projecting from a wider nave, or the installation of a chancel screen creating two  chambers out of one longitudinal footprint, or both. �is segregation into distinct  chambers gave primacy to two of the three liturgical centres of the church, with the  preaching pulpit dominating the nave while the communion table sat either cen- trally within the chancel or against the east wall. �e third liturgical centre, the  baptismal font, generally retained its ancient position near the main or west door  of the church. �is arrangement resulted in a fairly common building form con- sisting of a large mass for the nave (with or without a smaller chancel projection  from the east end) and, commonly, a western tower. �ere is abundant evidence of  this building form across the colonies in the late seventeenth century. Surviving  examples that represent this pattern include Ballinderry Middle Church in Lisburn,  Co. Antrim (c.1668), St Patrick’s Church, Waterford (c.1680), and St Mary’s,  Dublin (c.1700) in Ireland (see Plate 9); Newport Parish church (c.1685) and  St  Peter’s Parish Church (1701–3, tower 1739–40) in Virginia; the Valley  Church—St Mary’s Parish (c.1689), Antigua; and possibly St Anne’s, Sandy Point,  St Kitts (late seventeenth century).
 Even so, the Great Fire of London set the stage for the �rst broad experimentation  with Anglican church planning. Christopher Wren has been widely recognized 0 N. Yates, Buildings, Faith and Worship: �e Liturgical Arrangement of Anglican Churches, 1600–1900  (Oxford, 1991, revised edition 2000), chapter 4.
 as  the architect who popularized the Anglican model of an ‘auditory church’.  Writing near the end of his career, Wren drafted a letter that expounded at length  on his experience in London parish church design. In addition to commentaries  on materials, building in an urban setting, and the inappropriateness of urban  cemeteries, he also argued that church plans should respond to the practical con- straints of audibility, an extension of his scienti�c interest in sound. To that end,  Wren argued that churches should not be more than 60-ft wide and 90-ft long in  order that everyone inside might be able to hear the preacher, since ‘a moderate  Voice may be heard 50 Feet distant before the Preacher, 30 feet on each side, and  20 behind the Pulpit . . . without losing the Voice at the last Word of the Sentence’.  He further argued that given di�erences in emphasis, ‘a French Man is heard fur- ther than an English Preacher’, reinforcing the idea that his recommendations  resulted from experimentation. When providing an exemplar in his letter, Wren  o�ered St James, Piccadilly (1676–84)—a compact, rectangular auditory church.  However, to assign the introduction of the auditory Anglican church entirely to  Wren is to misunderstand the historical development of architectural typologies.  As Peter Guillery has demonstrated, London had a number of pre-�re examples of  ‘auditory’ churches and meeting-houses, most especially the Broadway Chapel in  Westminster. Furthermore, the development of auditory planning for new  Anglican churches occurred beyond London before and during Wren’s city church  building programme.4 Similar meeting-houses could be found on the Continent  as well, from France to the Netherlands.5 �us, while the very fact of the auditory  church cannot be assigned to Wren, the signi�cance of his church architecture lies  most securely in his experimentation and articulation of auditory principles.6
 A brief survey of those churches erected by Anglicans in the American colonies  o�ers a telling perspective on various aspects of late seventeenth- and eighteenth-  century church building practices. Carl Lounsbury has made the critical observa- tion that the establishment date of a colony appears to have played a role in shaping  local traditions of Anglican church design. In comparing the Anglican churches in  the adjacent colonies of Virginia and Maryland, for instance, Lounsbury notes  that, generally, longitudinal parish churches in Virginia parallel their counterparts  See ‘Letter on Building Churches’, in L. M. Soo, Wren’s ‘Tracts’ on Architecture and Other Writings  (Cambridge, 1998), pp. 107–11; see also P. Gouk, ‘�e Role of Acoustics and Music �eory in the  Scienti�c Work of Robert Hooke’, Annals of Science, vol. 37 (1980), pp. 573–605.

White, Protestant Worship and Church Architecture (Oxford, 1964), pp. 78–117.
 in England throughout the seventeenth and well into the eighteenth century. Yet,  in Maryland (a much younger colony than Virginia), parish churches correlate  strongly with the more compact auditory planning of the fashionable urban  churches built in London in the very late seventeenth century and early eight- eenth. Without the inscription of the older tradition in the landscape, Lounsbury  argues, the younger colony of Maryland adopted the newer auditory formula  more freely.7
 A second signi�cant pattern among eighteenth-century colonial Anglican  churches is also observable. Dell Upton’s careful analysis of parish churches in  Virginia makes clear that during the seventeenth century churches were generally  longitudinal, with a conceptual division between the nave and the chancel, similar  to those in contemporary England. When these parishes required larger buildings,  they often expanded by adding an extension perpendicular to the main building,  resulting in a ‘T’ plan. But some early eighteenth-century parishes, faced with  the  prospect of building anew, opted instead for cruciform planned churches  (Figure  5.1). Upton understands these buildings as accommodating the new  demands on audibility in large church buildings.8 But the cruciform church was  not unique to colonial Virginia.9 Even though newly built cruciform churches  were rare in eighteenth-century England, and were a sizable minority in Virginia  and in South Carolina, they were in the majority in Jamaica and Bermuda. �ey  were also common in the rural parishes of eighteenth-century Ireland.0 In add- ition to accommodating the increasing sensitivity for audibility, it seems likely that  the cruciform shape was also intended to be symbolic. St Paul’s parish church in  South Carolina was described as bearing ‘the form of a cross’, while St Andrew’s in  the same colony was described as enlarged ‘in the form of a cross’. In their desire  to distinguish or set apart their new churches in a newly colonized landscape,  Anglicans revealed a theological parallel between the baptism of a child and the  consecration of a church. Both were ritual acts of inscription that extended a claim  about the spiritual dwelling of God—one in a person, the other in a building.  Making the sign of the cross on the forehead of a child consecrated him or her for  service in the church. Similarly, the use of a cross in the form of the church might  have been seen as consecrating the land upon which it stands and protecting it  ‘against sin, the world, and the devil’. Even so, the shape was never entirely theo- logical. �e cruciform plan in Jamaica might simply have been a comforting and  familiar cultural marker of Englishness in an environmentally dangerous and  racially unfamiliar landscape. Anglicans in colonial contexts built churches that 7 C. Lounsbury, ‘Anglican Church Design in the Chesapeake: English Inheritances and Regional  Interpretations’, in A. K. Hoagland and K. A. Breisch (eds), Constructing Image, Identity, and Place:  Perspectives in Vernacular Architecture IX (Knoxville, 2003), pp. 22–38.

 One of the most prominent non-Anglican Protestant building traditions to  emerge as a result of English colonial expansion was that of dissenting meeting-  houses erected in New England in the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries  (see Figure 1.9). �ese colonies and their religious communities were established  as safe havens of dissenting worship set apart from the clear authority and oversight  of Anglican-dominated England. �e single open space of the typical meeting-  house interior was usually focused upon an elaborate, centrally located pulpit on  the long wall opposite the main door. �e other three sides were often surrounded  by a broad gallery elevated over a warren of box pews on the �oor below. �e   typical meeting-house was essentially an auditorium, and nothing more. In a  recent study of more than two thousand such buildings in New England and on  Long Island between 1622 and 1830, Peter Benes has demonstrated the gradual  transformation of the meeting-house from a square type in the seventeenth cen- tury to a more ‘churchly’ building in the early nineteenth. Over this period  building use evolved from a public space for almost any use—including adjudicat- ing civil cases—to sanctuaries reserved for the worship of God. So-called ‘Four- square’ meeting-houses were the earliest and most predominant form in New  England through the seventeenth century. �ere is a debate, however, as to whether  P.

 Complicating the range of sources is the fact that William Andrews, the builder  of the foursquare New Haven meeting-house (1639), had likely spent time in the  Netherlands before immigrating to New England, where numerous examples of  similar buildings erected by Reformed congregations were to be found. Such  buildings also existed in France and Scotland. �is suggests that the meeting-houses  erected in early seventeenth-century New England were part of an emerging con- vergent Protestant tradition which reached its apogee just as the congregations in  New England began to build, positioning New England’s early Puritans—all too  frequently thought of as fringe dissidents on the edge of empire—as participants  in a self-aware Reformed community that stretched across the British Isles,  Northern Europe, and the Americas—a migration made possible only through the  politics and reach of England’s then emergent empire.
 While Protestants were certainly in the majority among Christian communities  across the British empire, there were other denominations scattered throughout,  the greatest concentration being the Catholics of Ireland. A 1732 survey of church  buildings in Ireland indicates that in that year Ireland maintained over 900  Catholic churches, 200 of which had been recently erected. Even so, the majority  of datable surviving examples are from the later eighteenth century.8 �ese build- ings di�ered markedly from their Church of Ireland (Anglican) counterparts,  which usually enjoyed the bounty of state co�ers for their construction. As a result,  Catholic churches were generally simpler, box-like buildings, not dissimilar in  external appearance to Presbyterian meeting-houses. Most of the surviving urban 8 M. Craig, �e Architecture of Ireland: From the Earliest times to 1880 (Dublin, 1982), pp. 212,  216.
 Roman Catholics maintained a substantial presence in North America as well,  particularly in the predominantly French north (Acadia) and Spanish south (New  Spain). At the end of the Seven Years’ War the colony of New France (what is now  essentially Quebec) was formally ceded to the British at the Treaty of Paris (1763).  Quebec, or Lower Canada as it became known, was thus subsumed within the  British empire. Crucially, however, the residents of Quebec were allowed to keep  their language, religion, French civil law, and seigneurial system. What this meant  was that the substantial amount of religious architecture produced in Quebec not  only belonged to a di�erent European tradition (French) but continued to respond  to this tradition well after the province had become British territory. Indeed, in the  decades following the conquest of New France, the Catholic Church used its posi- tion deliberately to revive and promote traditional Acadian ecclesiastical forms as  a gesture towards nationalism and an expression of its renewed authority.9 A good  example of this is the Église Sainte-Marguerite at L’Acadie (1800–1), erected under  the direction of Abbé Pierre Conefroy (1752–1816), the vicar-general of the dio- cese of Quebec for the Montreal region. In many respects this is a classic French  colonial church that embodies planning principles dating back to the time of  François-Xavier de Montmorency-Lavalde Montigny, �rst Bishop of Quebec  (1674), as well as several Jesuit missionary features. It was also constructed using  rubble stone, with the west gable surmounted by a clocher with open belfry—both  characteristics of the French colonial manner.0 Not surprisingly, the French man- ner of ecclesiastical architecture in Quebec continued well into the nineteenth  century, and may be seen in its own way as a form of religious and cultural resist- ance to wider British, and therefore Protestant, values and ideals.
 In addition to broad denominational patterns that shaped religious architecture  across the empire, the rapid urbanization of eighteenth-century England and its  colonies was a major catalyst for new church construction. In 1710 Parliament  appointed a building commission to undertake the construction of �fty new  churches in the expanding suburbs of London and Westminster. While this pro- gramme resulted only in eleven �nished churches, it triggered a lively conversation  among architects and churchmen on the proper form of an Anglican church—one  that would generate scores of architectural drawings, sixteen wooden models, and  have an impact across England and its burgeoning empire. �e rapid expansion  of many cities and towns beyond London, including those such as Birmingham  and Bristol, required the subdivision of urban parishes and the construction of a  D.

 substantial number of new urban churches.4 Over the course of the eighteenth  century, Parliament passed 114 separate acts concerned with the construction or  reconstruction of parish churches, the majority of which were in locations outside  of London.5 Not limited to the motherland, this urban church building phenom- enon marked the urbanity and identity of Anglicans during the eighteenth century  through the erection of monumental city churches.
 But if the study and emulation of speci�c ancient or biblical buildings was not  widespread, the general emulation of antique temples was commonplace in city  churches across the empire. In his monumental study of the eighteenth-century  church in Britain, Terry Friedman has argued convincingly that by the early eight- eenth century architects designed churches intentionally in the form of antique  temples. �ese designs ranged from the peripheral temple with free-standing col- umns entirely surrounding the body of the church, to the more common practice  of designing the primary façade of a church with a portico or temple-front.4 An  excellent example is St Catherine’s Church in Dublin (1760) by John Smyth  (Figure 5.4). Here a monumental temple-front commands the central three bays of 4 See W. M. Jacob, Lay People and Religion (Cambridge, 2002), pp. 201–3; P.

 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY: DAWN OF A NEW ERA By the time we reach the nineteenth century revived Gothic becomes the most  common architectural language for ecclesiastical buildings in Britain and its  empire. �e advance of this style throughout the colonies was pegged �rmly to  increased church extension and missionary activity. Indeed, as outlined above, the  Christian missionary enterprise in its broadest, non-denominational sense had 4 Ibid., pp. 609–10; R. Tavernor, Palladio and Palladianism (London, 1991), pp. 181–7; S. Nilsson,  European Architecture in India 1750–1850 (London, 1968), pp. 126–30; A.

 long been a concern to Britain as a colonizing power. But it was only in the late  eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that a serious organizational imperative  arose, both among Nonconformists and the established Church of England. But  the Church of England, despite having three a�liate missionary organizations by  1800—the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (1699), the SPG (1701),  and the Church Missionary Society (CMS, 1799)—had accomplished little in  terms of evangelizing the non-European world.
 It was not until around the beginning of the 1840s that the perceived need to  promote Christianity as part of British imperial policy took root in the ‘o�cial  mind’ of the ruling elite. �e powerful religious sensibilities of Victorian society  necessarily a�ected the way Britain perceived itself and its moral obligation to the  wider world, particularly its own colonial empire.44 �us, the Colonial Bishoprics’  Fund (CBF) was founded in 1841 for the purpose of establishing o�cially sanc- tioned Church of England dioceses abroad. A number of such dioceses already  existed by this time, including Nova Scotia (1787), Calcutta (1814), and Jamaica  (1824), but the advent of the CBF, along with the reinvigoration of the somewhat  moribund SPG, provided considerable impetus in terms of motivation, money,  and manpower. In the thirty years between its inauguration and c.1870, the CBF  was responsible for erecting around forty new dioceses, where only ten had been  founded in the previous 250 years of British colonial expansion.
 With this came a wave of church building activity. As the ideas of A. W. N. Pugin  (1812–52) regarding the Christian basis of Gothic architecture began to penetrate  Anglican circles, societies dedicated speci�cally to the promotion of medieval archi- tecture were formed, including the Ecclesiological (formerly Cambridge Camden)  Society and the Oxford Society for Promoting the Study of Gothic Architecture,  both founded in 1839. �e Ecclesiological Society’s ideas were particularly wide- spread and in�uential, and under its auspices the Gothic Revival acquired the lustre  of a serious, ‘scienti�c’, and even crusade-like endeavour.
 Importantly, the ideologies entrenched concerning medieval architecture’s  claims to origins, authenticity, and ‘truthfulness’—all notions that appealed to the  morally encumbered Victorian frame of mind—were carried to Britain’s colonies  via a new and younger breed of Oxbridge-educated clergyman. �ese clergy saw it  as partly their responsibility to promulgate Gothic architecture within a wider  regime of orderliness and propriety concerning the religious character, moral  veracity, and loyalist sympathies of colonial society, including a greater sense of  urgency towards evangelizing indigenous peoples.
 In this sense, the rather sudden deployment of this style of architecture had a  four-fold purpose: to inspire and thereby transform the state of Christianity among  the expatriate settler communities of the British empire through its perceived  beauty, integrity, and solemnity; to introduce higher levels of reverence, spirituality,  and propriety through reformed liturgical practices; to mark out and identify the  urban and rural landscapes of Britain’s empire as being associated with a particular 44 G. A. Bremner, Imperial Gothic: Religious Architecture and High Anglican Culture in the British  Empire, c.1840–70 (New Haven and London, 2013).
 �e early leaders in this endeavour were clergymen, not architects, as very little  if any architectural expertise existed on the colonial frontier. �ere are numerous  examples of clergymen acting as both designers and builders of churches, such as  the Rev. F. H. Cox (1821–1906) of Tasmania. Cox, like his bishop, the Rev. Francis  Nixon (1803–79) of Hobart, were typical of this new breed of Anglican cleric who  took the idea of ‘correct’ church architecture seriously. �e Tractarian spirit with  which they were imbued necessitated that they hold the proper ordinance of the  sacraments in high regard, along with their formal con�guration. It was here that  organizations such as the Ecclesiological Society proved particularly useful. Seeing  the British colonial world as very much within its authoritative ambit, the Society  sent three church designs by R. C. Carpenter to Tasmania. �e designs were for  three buildings of varying sizes, to be used depending upon circumstance, with  Cox using the smallest as the basis for the parish church of St John the Baptist  (1847), Prosser Plains (Buckland), near Hobart—among the very �rst Anglican  churches of its kind in the British empire (Figure 5.6).
 �is approach, which exploited the extensive network of Anglican clerical ties  throughout the ever-expanding British world would become something of a pat- tern as more and more Anglican dioceses were erected across Britain’s empire  during the nineteenth century. �ere are numerous other examples one could  point to, including the assistance given to bishops G. A. Selwyn of New Zealand,  John Medley of New Brunswick (see Figure  7.12), and James Chapman of  Colombo (Sri Lanka). Indeed, when asked how many churches around the world  had been a�ected by the ideas of the Ecclesiological Society, John Mason Neale  (one of the Society’s co-founders) is reputed to have replied: ‘It would be as di�- cult almost as to count the stars on a clear frosty night.’46 �e increasing ease with  which architectural literature in the form of journals, magazines, and pattern  books could be accessed by this time also played a role in the transmission of this  new architectural economy (for Selwyn and New Zealand in this regard, see  Chapter 10, pp. 363–4).47
 If Anglicans, initially at least, were less well prepared, the same cannot be said of  the Roman Catholic Church and its missionaries. Church ritual and ceremony,  including its proper architectural setting, were of course central to Catholic wor- ship. �is concern followed Catholics more or less wherever they went, including  into British colonial territory. �rough emancipation (1829), enhanced seminary  education, and the e�orts of internationally orientated organizations such as the  Association for the Propagation of the Faith, plans to extend the presence of the  Catholic faith in Britain’s colonies were well underway by the early part of the nine- teenth century.48 Again, Australia was targeted early on by Catholics owing partly  to its large Irish immigrant population (both convicts and those escaping poverty  and starvation), and partly because of the potential it o�ered to extend Roman  Catholic in�uence in a society that was often characterized as irreligious.
 5 Architecturally speaking, the Roman Catholic Church was of course active throughout the British  empire. For Canada, see M. �urlby, ‘Joseph Connolly in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kingston,  Ontario’, Journal of the Society for the Study of Architecture in Canada (  JSSAC ), vol. 30:2 (2005), pp. 25–38.
 By the 1850s Presbyterian and Nonconformist congregations had begun mov- ing in the direction of Gothic as well. Although there were a number of experi- ments in so-called ‘Dissenting Gothic’ among Unitarian and Congregationalist  communities in Britain dating from the 1840s, this approach was not common.  Until this point Nonconformist architecture had largely been a utilitarian a�air.  �e otherworldly theology of orthodox Protestantism had not necessarily encour- aged the pursuit of such lowly matters as architecture—almost any building could  serve as a Methodist chapel, for instance. If any ‘style’ was adopted at all, it tended  to be a plain form of classicism—what the Rev. Frederick Jobson referred to as the  ‘usual style’. To be sure, John Ruskin’s elegant musings on the nature and meaning  of medieval architecture had begun to liberate Gothic architecture from ‘popish’  associations, but it was not until the publication of Jobson’s Chapel and School  Architecture (1850), followed by James Cubitt’s Church Design for Congregations  (1870), that Gothic forms among Nonconformist communities began to acquire  broader and more consistent appeal.56
 Chapel (1845–50), Grahamstown, with its elaborate Gothic façade.57 Although  not a sophisticated use of the style, it nevertheless demonstrates that Methodists  were open to Gothic forms. Why this occurred so early in some cases is di�cult to  ascertain, but it probably had something to do with the perceived liberty to use  medieval styles in a context where the Church of England was not established, and  where the taint of Roman Catholicism and its associations was largely absent.

 context as ‘Tropical Pointed’.60 Indeed, as Webb’s friend and colleague A. J. B.  Beresford Hope reminded the Society’s members: Our present studies proceed upon the ever-present assumption that the Christian  Church is a living and an energizing body. . . . We must not . . . con�ne ourselves to  England or to the Western Church, we must penetrate to the East and her venerable  hereditary uses. . . . We should remember that Great Britain reigns over the torrid and  the hyperborean zone, that she will soon have to rear temples of the True Faith in  Benares and Labrador, Newfoundland and Cathay.6
 Culturally speaking, adaptation was also important. In foreign contexts, and  on the mission �eld, especially where clergymen encountered large numbers of  non-Christian indigenes, means of controlling access to church buildings  became a problem. In such contexts the resurrection of medieval spatial devices  such as porches and narthexes became necessary. Such devices were adopted, for  example, in the context of East Africa under the auspices of the Universities’  Mission to Central Africa (UMCA), where careful liturgical arrangements were  made in the design of churches to separate ‘inquirers’ and catechumens from  Christians.66

 CONSTRUCTING INSTITUTIONS: EDUCATION,  ARCHITECTURE, AND EMPIRE Closely allied to religion and the missionary endeavour was the extension of  European educational practices to the non-European world. �ese were not only  forms of cultural imperialism, but they also went hand in hand with colonial  expansion to the extent that it was often left to religious institutions to establish  schools, particularly during the initial phases of settlement. If we are to view  Ireland as an English colony, then Trinity College, Dublin, is the earliest such  institution, founded by Royal Charter in 1592. A staunchly Protestant enterprise,  the college was intended as a bastion for the political elite in tightening their grip  on power in Ireland. It was perceived by its supporters as surpassing even the zeal  of Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1584), upon which it was  modelled, in ‘sus- taining a godly curriculum and environment’.70 Beyond the British Isles, the  earliest such establishment, and another descendant of Emmanuel College, was  Harvard College (originally ‘New College’) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded  in 1636, the college would eventually take the name of its initial benefactor (1638),  the London-born, Cambridge-educated Puritan minister, John Harvard (1607–38).  �e �rst buildings at Harvard were existing houses purchased from town residents.  But by the early 1640s it had been decided that the students were to be ‘brought  up in a more Collegiate Way of Living’, and so a new, purpose-built facility was  erected. ‘Old’ or ‘Harvard’ College, as this ‘very faire and comely’ structure became  known, was monumental in scale and based on aspects of Eton College in England.  It was also the largest building in New England at the time. Eventually an informal  open quadrangle would take shape around ‘the Yard’, including a President’s  Lodge, Go�e College, and an Indian College (1650s). Like the structures that  would replace these in the 1670s, the initial foundation buildings at Harvard were  generally large, singular blocks with �oors housing all the various functions neces- sary of an educational institution (Figure 5.11).7 Both Trinity College, Dublin,  and Harvard College demonstrate the close ties education was seen to have, ideo- logically speaking, with religion in the expansion of the British state during the late  sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.
 dissenting Protestant communities. As a result, these colleges were founded and  then expanded without a chapel, which was a marked departure from the English  Oxbridge precedent.
 By the beginning of the nineteenth century the �rst educational establishments  of this kind began to appear in British India. �e missionary connection was  strong, with the CMS, the SPCK, and the SPG all leading the charge for the foun- dation of what would become Bishop’s College, Calcutta (est. 1820). By this time  the Anglican diocese of Calcutta had already been established (1814), with arch- deaconries in Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay. �e Rev. �omas F. Middleton  (1769–1822) presided as �rst bishop over what was a huge see, including all of  India and Australia. Initially wary of Christian missionary intervention, the EIC  donated the land upon which the new College would rise. Rendered in a simple  but clear Gothic Revival idiom, its cultural and religious intentions were clear. Its  purpose was fourfold: to train Indians for the service of the Church; to o�er secular  teaching to other Indians; to translate Christian literature; and to prepare new  missionaries.75 Over £50,000 was raised for the cause, with Middleton observing 7 Ibid., pp. 33–7. 74 �ese plans are by the military engineer Christian Lilly. Although supplied to the college, these were quite elaborate and later abandoned. �ere is now evidence from the SPG archive in Oxford that  an architect, by the name of John James, was engaged to pare back the design and produce new draw- ings, which were used to erect the building. See K. Jones, ‘“A college for the mission?” Codrington  College, Barbados (1710–1743)’, unpublished MA thesis (Courtauld Institute of Art, London, 2009).
 �is close connection between education and religion continued into the latter  part of the nineteenth century. As Iain Jackson and Ola Uduku observe in  Chapter 11, the missionary connection was strong in tropical West Africa espe- cially, with evangelical Anglican, Methodist, and Presbyterian societies all vying  with one another in erecting schools in places such as Sierra Leone, Gold Coast,  and Nigeria. Notions of ‘godliness and good learning’, wedded to concepts of  ‘muscular Christianity’, were in the ascendency throughout the British world,  owing in part at least to the Arnoldian reform of the English public school  system.77  Evidence of this can be found in the numerous faith-based schools established in  the settler dominions, including Church of England, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian,  and Methodist institutions.78 Even with the establishment of universities at around  the same time, which were non-religious foundations (like London and Edinburgh,  but unlike Oxford, Cambridge, and Trinity College, Dublin), we �nd a�liated  colleges of residence along denominational lines. �is is clear at the universities of  Toronto, Sydney, Melbourne, and Hong Kong, for instance, established between  the mid-nineteenth century and the early twentieth.79
 84 P. Cunich, ‘Making Space for Higher Education in Colonial Hong Kong, 1887–1913’, in  L. Victoir and V. Zatsepine (eds), Harbin to Hanoi: �e Colonial Built Environment in Asia, 1840 to  1940 (Hong Kong, 2012), pp. 182–3.
 Institutions of this kind sought to establish in their own way pedagogical imper- atives the ultimate purpose of which was to inculcate Western values and ideals  into a native Asian elite, thus �tting this class for a life of leadership and service  within the empire. Indeed, as Peter Cunich has argued, Hong Kong University was  set up with the speci�c aim of helping create just such a class of graduates—drawn  from Hong Kong, the mainland, and nearby British territories—who could act,  among other things, as agents of British scienti�c, industrial, and economic expan- sion within the foreign spheres of in�uence of Imperial China.98
 If recent scholarship has implored us to consider that British imperialism was as  much a cultural phenomenon as it was a political and economic one, then both  religion and education were at the forefront of the endeavour to transplant  European values and ideas, as well as transform indigenous societies. More often  than not, religion and education went hand-in-hand in this process, especially up  until the end of the nineteenth century. Religious buildings, as the physical expres- sion of faith, were very important to early settlers in what would eventually become  Britain’s worldwide empire, and were often among the �rst buildings erected. �ey  were important primarily because they were fundamental to the identities of these  settlers, many of whom required emotional and spiritual strength and guidance 0 T.

 in leaving their homes and families to forge new lives abroad. Even for later waves  of colonists and missionaries, church architecture remained symbolic of this  undertaking.

 From the second half of the nineteenth century we see the profound ways in  which architecture and spatial planning were a�ected by both the Revolt and its  aftermath. Even while the British sought to segregate themselves increasingly from  Indians, the emergence of modern public institutions and shared spaces resulted in  the creation and expansion of what may be termed a ‘joint public realm’. Here,  statues and busts dedicated to Indian worthies would join those raised to British  ones. Distinct from both real and imagined ethnic, religious, and class enclaves,  this ‘joint public realm’ was a spatial arena that, in theory, was owned by and open  to all citizens which helped in the construction of an imagined common  public.4

 It was these young architects that would foster the introduction of Modernism  to Australia, supported by return trips to England and continental Europe in the  1920s and 1930s.7 �e modern—or more properly, the Moderne—at this time  again saw the dual in�uence of England and the USA.

 imposed a grid of streets on the limited �at land available at �orndon and Te Aro,  forming the armature for the modern city. In Auckland, however, the Colonial  Government’s Surveyor General, Felton Mathew, adopted the additional formality  of crescents and quadrants in an attempt to accommodate the undulating topog- raphy of the site, although with limited success. In order to revive its �agging for- tunes, the New Zealand Company’s later settlements were adapted to appeal to  speci�c groups of settlers and re�ected particular social, cultural, religious, and  even national identities. �us in Otago, established as a predominantly Free  Church of Scotland settlement, the names of Dunedin’s main streets perpetuated  those of Edinburgh; while in the Church of England settlement of Canterbury to  the north, Anglican associations were evoked by naming major streets in  Christchurch after English bishoprics, including, in a response to the global expan- sion of Anglicanism, Irish and colonial sees (see Plate 3). �e growing recognition  by mid-century of the need for cities to incorporate ample open space is also seen  in the reservation of extensive Town Belts, green spaces �anking the central areas  of Wellington and Dunedin.

 strong, ensuring that ecclesiological principles were in�uential well beyond New  Zealand.
 Ecclesiological ideals were also in�uential in Canterbury, founded in 1850  under the auspices of the Canterbury Association, whose President was the  Archbishop of Canterbury.9 Canterbury was intended as a model Church of  England settlement and was a clear expression of many of the most potent themes  of mid-century British culture: religious reform, idealistic immigration theory, and  the social critique implicit in Victorian medievalism. �e Gothic Revival in  Canterbury became the architectural embodiment of these ideals.0 From the out- set the Canterbury Association was intent on shaping the architectural develop- ment of the colony, commissioning a model design for a combined chapel, school,  and master’s house from William Butter�eld in 1849. George Gilbert Scott also  designed a timber church for Canterbury around 1850, although this, like  Butter�eld’s chapel school, remained unbuilt. �e dominant �gure in Canterbury 9 L. C.

 Initially, this was very much an unregulated and haphazard form of develop- ment, lacking any real sense of coherent planning, including sanitary provision,  until the later initiation of colonial town planning ordinances. Christian mis- sionary organizations—mainly but not exclusively the CMS, the Methodist and  Presbyterian missions—produced some of the largest structures in Sierra Leone,  Gold Coast, and Nigeria, largely in the form of churches, assembly halls, and  schools. �ese structures were basic in design, utilizing materials either locally  available or carried in ship ballast for construction. Later, structures would  include prefabricated iron kits imported from Glasgow or Liverpool.5 �e most  prominent schools were among those founded by the CMS, such as Fourah Bay  College (Sierra Leone, c.1900), and the British Colonial government’s advanced  secondary colleges, including Achimota College (Legon, Gold Coast, 1924), with  its campanile clock tower topped with a chateau-like roof, and King’s College,  Lagos (est. 1909)—both erected by the PWD. Missionary organizations were  also responsible for the founding of educational institutions in the Gold  Coast, at Mfantsipim (Methodist, 1876), and at Adisadel, Cape Coast (Anglican,  1910), and Akropong (buildings date from 1927), near Accra, with sparsely 5 �e most famous foundries in Glasgow were the Carron Company, Lion Foundry, and Walter  McFarlane’s Saracen Foundry.
 Roman Catholicism had long been present in the Holy Land; the Franciscans  even enjoyed the title ‘Keepers of the Holy Land’ owing to the number of build- ings they superintended. But Protestantism had little physical presence and, more  importantly, had no actual control over any monuments in the Holy Land.5 �e  sites and structures associated with the foundations of Christianity were controlled  by France and Italy, predominantly Catholic nations. In the mid-nineteenth cen- tury, Britain and Germany, the two great Protestant nations of Europe, founded a  joint bishopric in the Holy Land, which was to be based in Christ Church.  Possession of the bishopric was to have alternated between a German and a British  bishop, but with the deterioration in relations between Germany and Britain in  the 1880s, this was abandoned. �e Germans founded their own bishopric, located 5 �e importance of Gordon’s ‘discovery’ of the Garden Tomb is not so much whether the site is  actually Christ’s tomb or not, but that it was controlled by Protestants, as opposed to every other site  of religious signi�cance in Jerusalem, which was controlled by Catholics.

 The direction of what Barker charted as these ‘trails of light’ can be seen in images such as Samuel Brees’ Church of England, Wellington [Figure 8.1], in which women cluster about colonial churches. In fact, women were almost always pictured in the vicin- ity of churches when these featured in colonial prospects. The reason lies, again, in the force of metropolitan understandings of female ‘character’. Women were more religious than men, Edward Gibbon Wakefield argued in 1849, and this especially equipped them to ensure colonies were both ‘virtuous and polite’. Without proper regard for religious observance, he warned, a colony would attract only ‘paupers, vagabonds and sluts’ and, amongst the higher orders, only men of desperate fortunes, flying from debt and dis- grace. ‘You would sow bad seed, plant sorry offsets, build with rotten materials: your colony would be disgusting’, he rounded.
 At home, there was increasing impatience with what Dickens described as a kind of ‘telescopic philanthropy’, and proselytising, Christianising lectures, ‘meetings in aid of missions to the Quashiboos, the Rumbatumbas, or the Oolalooloo cannibals’ were dismissed out  of hand by Sala, along with those Puritan hordes who subscribed ‘thousands of pounds yearly in an almost insane hope of converting heathen barbarians to a better faith’. In fact, a strong case was made that metropolitan observers did not understand the realities of colonial life. Conflict with the Xhosa, provided occasions for fierce denuncia- tions of humanitarianist views, and Charles Bunbury pronounced renewed Xhosa depredations in 1846 had exposed the ‘erroneous nature of some opinions, respecting the affairs of the Cape, which have been industriously inculcated by a numerous and active party in this country’. The ‘Exeter Hall interest’ as that humanitarian grouping of missionary societies, the Anti-Slavery Society and Aborigines Protection Society was increasingly dismissively termed, had been in the ascen- dant during the late 1830s and early 1840s but, from the mid 1840s, its authority was under challenge. Between 1836 and 1847 it had gained some support at the Colonial Office through James Stephen, Perma- nent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies and a member of the Committee of the Church Missionary Society, as well as from Parlia- ment’s willingness to legislate for the details of colonial policy. With the arrival of Earl Grey and Stephen’s successor, Herman Merivale, however, this began to change. The new Colonial Secretary left the details of colonial affairs largely to local discretion while, for his part, Merivale recognised that relations between settlers and indigenous populations were the product not so much of policies hatched at home as of the realities of the colonial situation. Alongside these develop- ments, contemporary pressure for self-government in Britain’s settler colonies, with its willing advocate in Earl Grey, had a profound effect on the discussion of relations between British settlers and indigenous populations. Colonists’ dreams of their ‘new nation’ rarely provided for the latter except in subservient roles. In his 1841 Lectures on Coloniza- tion and Colonies, Merivale had urged abandoning the practice of setting aside native reserves, arguing instead for amalgamation with European settlers as the necessary first step in a slow journey to civilisa- tion, as well as the peaceable and orderly progress of colonisation and, in an 1861 edition of the work, he adoringly footnoted George Grey’s particular success in forging settler and indigenous unity in New Zealand and the Cape by this means, extolling him as possessed of ‘the rare skill of entering into the savage mind and becoming ... intelligible to it’.12

 A fourth type of business network that emerged in the context of eigh­ teenth­century German migration to British North America was based on  the transatlantic ties of Protestant clergymen. Thus the Lutheran pastors  whom the Halle institutions founded by the pietist August Hermann  Francke (1663–1727) sent to Pennsylvania and other colonies in order to  minister to the German Lutheran settlers there were not only concerned  with the state of immigrants’ souls but also took care of some of their  material concerns. They used their ties to church institutions in Europe to  forward letters, post search advertisements in newspapers and handle  inheritance cases.37 Above all, they imported books and pharmaceuticals  from the workshops of the Halle institutions in substantial quantities.
 refugees from all over Continental Europe who met in London. In these  circles discussion focused on the best way how to create an egalitarian  society. One method, proposed among others by Karl Marx and Friedrich  Engels, was active propaganda in Europe to cause a revolution which  would then, they believed, lead to the next stage of social development  and to communism. An alternative suggestion regarding the formation of  a communist society, however, referred to the creation of communitarian  settlements in the non-European world. Far away and undisturbed from  the influences of European capitalism, these settlements should be nuclei  from which the communitarian ideology would spread outwards and  from there over the rest of the world. Thus, so the defenders of the argu- ment claimed, communism could be realised in the present, which was  better than simply theorising about an ideal society in the future.
 The latter point of view was central to debates among socialists in  London in the 1840s. Protagonists of the idea of forming communitarian  colonies included the British socialist Robert Owen, who set up a number  of cooperative communities in Britain and the United States, the French  socialist Etienne Cabet, who launched the communitarian settlement  Icaria in the United States, and, on the German side, Wilhelm Weitling,  who was one of the most ardent fighters for communitarian colonies   in the non-European world. Weitling had developed an interest in com- munitarianism in Paris and Zurich. When he had to flee to London in  1844, he got in touch with Robert Owen and propagated his plan for over- seas communities among the German socialists in the Kommunistische  Arbeiterbildungsverein. There, a major debate about the topic took place  in 1845. Weitling’s opponents demanded that socialists should concen- trate their powers in Europe to fight for their goals. Distributing them- selves all over the world would weaken the socialists’ position in Europe.  Even though Weitling gained some support, he could not convince the  members of the Kommunistische Arbeiterbildungsverein to support his  projects. In 1846 he left London and one year later founded the colony  Kommunia in Iowa.12
 He was convinced that a European state that wanted to play an important  role in international politics should have overseas colonies. They not only  added to the international prestige of a nation, Bunsen believed, but were  also beneficial to the political and social situation at home. Being an emi- nent personality in the Protestant missionary networks of the first half of  the nineteenth century, he was, furthermore, involved in the foundation  of Protestant missionary communities in Africa. He hoped that they  would bring Western civilisation and Protestantism to the dark, heathen- ish regions of the world. As a diplomat in London, Bunsen aimed to estab- lish a German emigrants’ colony in California in the early 1840s. He was  supported by Prussian officials in London and the United States and by  the Hamburg merchant Karl Sieveking. Although he had advanced far in  his negotiations and the Foreign Office seemed to have tolerated his ambi- tions, the government in Berlin refused to support the project.15
 In the field of religion, Anglo-German co-operation was based on simi- lar preconditions. Around 1800, a wave of evangelicalism swept over  Britain, Continental Europe and North America. In order to spread the  gospel among the ‘heathen’, a large number of new missionary societies  were founded. The British clergy regarded the empire as entrusted to  them by God and felt it to be a moral obligation to make use of the oppor- tunities it provided for missionary work. Despite evangelical enthusiasm  for converting Africans and Indians to Protestantism, there were not  enough volunteers to cover the high demand for missionaries. Societies in  Basel and Berlin, on the other hand, had the candidates for missionary  work, but they lacked the overseas infrastructure and the financial means  to establish their students in the southern hemisphere. Thus it was agreed  to send out clergy from Basel and Berlin as members of the British mis- sionary societies, in particular of the Church Missionary Society and the  London Missionary Society. In the first half of the nineteenth century, a  high percentage of the missionaries in British missionary societies were  German-born.30
 German missionaries’ integration into British missionary societies fol- lowed a similar pattern. On the one hand, there were tensions and   conflicts regarding denominational discrepancies between Anglican rep- resentatives of the Church Missionary Society and the Reformed and  Lutheran Protestants of Basel and Berlin. German missionaries were   not prepared to make theological concessions to Anglicanism. On the  other hand, they became part of the process of British expansionism in  many ways. They were convinced of the superiority of Protestantism and  Western values and supported British missionary societies in propagating these in Africa and South Asia. For example, they assisted the Church  Missionary Society’s plans to develop the cotton industry of Western  Africa as a morally legitimate enterprise. They also adopted certain pat- terns of thinking of British missionaries and began to define their mis- sionary work in relation to secular aspects of expansion.36
 While many Germans settled in Britain, many others transferred them- selves directly to parts of the British Empire, or else went there after  spending time first in Britain. German scientific explorers, fascinated by  the findings brought back from British colonies, were attracted from the  late eighteenth century onwards to areas of the Empire. German mer- chants, as they were drawn to the British mainland, were also attracted  out to imperial destinations, and could be found alongside their British  mercantile brethren in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and elsewhere.  British commercial policy, and Britain’s domination of shipping, encour- aged German colonial entrepreneurs to remain close to the British impe- rial infrastructure. British missionary activity, meanwhile, was supported  by, and often drew on the active help of, German churches and groups.   A common Protestantism, and a particularly close relationship between  British Evangelical groups and German Protestantism, underpinned a  range of jointly supported projects abroad. While tensions existed  between German and British missionaries on the frontline of the empire,  German missionary activity, like its commercial counterpart, also never- theless depended to a great extent on the infrastructure of the British  Empire for its existence and operation.2
 Theodor von Bunsen, a prominent member of the Centralverein. Koerber  herself sent a newspaper article reporting the founding of the Centralverein  to Ottawa.57 Koerber’s plans for a transnational network of ladies’ societ- ies fitted well into the programme of the Centralverein. Even more so, her  acquaintance with Otto Hahn enhanced her credentials. In his 1866 and  1878 publications, Hahn had demonstrated that his thinking about emi- gration moved in the same direction as that of the Centralverein, espe- cially when he defended emigration as a way to establish lasting  commercial and cultural connections with overseas territories.58 With the  founding of a Württemberg branch of the Verein für Handelsgeographie,  Hahn quickly became the Centralverein’s most important source of infor- mation about Canada.59 Addressing audiences which were considerably  more conservative than himself, Hahn managed to craft an ingenious  argument for promotion of German emigration to Canada and against the  acquisition of German formal colonies.60 His arguments probably met  with some disapproval but he couched them in such nationalistic terms  that even the Deutsche Kolonialverein under the leadership of Prince  Hohenlohe-Langenburg took note of his cause.61 Throughout the 1880s,  Otto Hahn was Canada’s voice among Germany’s colonial advocates and  power elites.
 1914, the Prussian State Church in particular intensified its transnational  activities, strengthening the legal and organisational framework for an  increasing number of diaspora congregations to become attached. These  acted as an important vehicle to embed the nationalist rhetoric produced  within the Reich into emigrants’ notions of belonging and ethnic identity.  Their pastors had been ordained in Germany, representing a specific kind  of ‘Pastorennationalismus’. On the eve of the First World War, 27 German  protestant congregations existed in Britain: ten in the capital and another  17 in provincial cities, catering for a considerable percentage of the  migrant community.36 Pastor Münchmeyer, in a sermon before his con- gregation in Glasgow, describes the flood of patriotic enthusiasm on the birthday of our beloved Kaiser, which  had a particularly religious slant in our German congregations in Britain  […]. It was a telling testimony of the fact that the love towards the German  empire and its monarch constitutes an ever stronger point of unity for our  diversely composed congregations.37
 The overlapping of religious and secular spheres can be seen on a purely  personal level. In Britain, the pastors were board-members of the  Flottenvereine. In 1913, seven out of 12 board-members of the Glasgow  Flottenverein were also office bearers in the protestant congregation.41   A similar situation existed in Edinburgh, where Professor Julius Eggeling  was the chairman of the local navy club, as well as an office bearer in both  the protestant congregation in Edinburgh and the Association of German  Protestant Congregations in Great Britain and Ireland. Nation and Church  stood in a symbiotic relationship, just as in Germany.
 Journalists, historians and social reformers argued in similar vein, proposing that empire federation should embrace America in a ‘Pan-Saxon Alliance’ of the English and American people. H. G. Wells would later call this a ‘great synthesis of the English-speaking peoples’, with its ‘head and centre’ in the ‘great urban region developing between Chicago and the Atlantic’.25
 Thatcher's public commitment to these ideas represented a notable shift in her own outlook and was prompted by her sharp turn against the EU. But there was continuity too in some of the sentiments she expressed, not least in terms of her own ongoing commitment to the Atlanticist ideal, which was still, in her mind, the core of the Anglosphere. Now blessed by Thatcher, this cause became of increasing interest to a new generation of Eurosceptic Conservative politicians and commentators, including David (later Lord) Howell, John Redwood, Daniel Hannan, David Davis, Norman Lamont, Liam Fox, Bill Cash, David Willetts and Michael Howard.
 During the long years of Labour rule in the UK, these governments provided a sympathetic international milieu around which the peripatetic ranks of think-tankers, MPs, intellectuals, media moguls and business donors associated with the Anglosphere could develop their networks, ideas and influence. The model for this kind of transnational Anglophone communion had been cast by Lionel Curtis in the first half of the twentieth century. Curtis worked variously as a government adviser, an Oxford don, a political pamphleteer and an author and was the prime mover in the Round Table movement and founder of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (popularly known as Chatham House). In the course of all this activity, he travelled regularly in the British dominions. Although few have matched his prolific output and influence, later Anglosphere enthusiasts were often following in his footsteps, though travelling towards a very different destination. As we saw in chapter 1, Curtis ended his career supporting union in Europe and a wider international Western federation. The architects of the twenty-first-century Anglosphere were developing arguments in favour of dismantling the European bloc and promoting a new, Atlanticist world order.
 For proponents of this outlook, including Trump, the EU's perceived inability to deal with the rising threat of political Islamic radicalism was the primary justification for Brexit. For Trump, this has made the UK an important point of reference, a conviction reinforced by some of his advisors' links with Nigel Farage and other British Eurosceptics. More generally, the political and corporate networks which the new president has assiduously cultivated are transatlantic in character and outlook and emanate from a longstanding set of networks and institutions which have often been committed to the ideals of the Anglosphere. These include such organisations as the Heritage Foundation, the Charles G. Koch Foundation, the Cato Institute and the (now disbanded) Atlantic Bridge.
 -0 3- “Mere” legal order is thus possible through natural incentives, as  Hobbes showed. But Kant also clearly indicates (here and elsewhere) that  it’s not enough (can only ever be provisional), and that progress through   enlightenment includes the transition from mere legal order to a civil soci- ety in which one’s autonomy is genuinely respected. The transition from  the state of nature to civil society includes a stage in which a legal order  may be in place, but not yet just. Still, it ought to be respected if it pro- motes the possibility of eventual rightful possession under a truly just civil  authority.
 -0 3- mandate of the Roman Church, rendering all ultimately subject to papal  jurisdiction, to its authority. To this was joined an additional papal role  of mediation between rival Iberian powers. Both impulses found expres- sion in fifteenth-century papal bulls, notably Romanus Pontifex (1455)  mediating Portuguese and Castilian competition for ascendancy in the  Eastern Atlantic, and Inter Caetera (1493) granting the unified Spanish  monarchy of Ferdinand and Isabella the territorial fruits of Columbus’  first  transoceanic voyage.9
 -0 3- colonizers’ advisors certainly acknowledged both the presence and author- ity of local sovereigns, for they advised reaching strategic accommodations  with them en route to gaining dominion over them.51 Yet the first decades  of actual English attempts also saw their discourse of intrusion undergo  a transformation. The articulation of English claims qua European rivals  remained consonant with intra-European dispositions of transoceanic  acquisitions inflected by Roman law. But as a set of techniques for achiev- ing goals on the ground colonizing acquired a distinct English idiom, in  which, increasingly, attention focused on the possession of territory to the  exclusion of its inhabitants.
 From the early 1620s, English charters also embraced and anticipated  massive transfers of population as colonization’s purpose. Clearly the first  to do so was Sir William Alexanders’s “New Scotland” grant. Its emphasis  lay on colonization as an act of self-renewal undertaken by a population  “led forth into new territory, which they may fill with colonies.”72 The  sentiment became commonplace.73
 The impact of Blackstone’s Commentaries as a guide to the substance of  English law and procedure and as a stimulus to constitutional contention was  to be assisted by a phenomenon of empire—the networking and peripatetic  careers of colonial officials.24 As Bridget Brereton and John Bennett have  demonstrated in their biographical work, the movement between colonies of  judges with developed views on law and constitutionalism influenced legal  and political discourse in those possessions.25 Moreover, judges who needed  to test their understanding of the law were not shy about making contact with  their counterparts in other colonies who might have faced similar issues.26
 -0 3- Elite hauteur, manipulation of the levers of colonial governance and  law, and an obsessive fear of disloyalty among the population were evident  in Upper Canada in the years after the War of 1812. The law officers of  the Crown and most of the judges were associated with a group described  as the Family Compact—including colonial officials, businessmen, and  churchmen—committed to preserving and replicating their own high  Tory, anti-democratic values in the governance of the colony.47 For the  Crown lawyers the justice system was a legitimate instrument for neutral- izing or even ridding themselves of those with a different vision of soci- ety. The exclusivist views of these men did not go unchallenged, however.  The presence of reformist lawyers, such as William Warren Baldwin, in  the Assembly in the early 1820s was to introduce the discourse of a more  liberal constitutional tradition, drawing strength from eighteenth-century  English country Whigs, Irish Whig ideology, and expansive readings of  Blackstone. Baldwin went on the attack against the Sedition Act. He argued  that as long as the Act, with its provisions for summary arrest and banish- ment, remained in force Upper Canadians were “without a constitution,  at least a free one.” “The statute,” he continued, “remained in force not  only in the face of Magna Carta, but directly in the face of all the statutes  made for the liberty and protection of the subject.”48 Baldwin began assert- ing that the Constitution Act of 1791 represented a compact between the  Crown and people of Upper Canada (reflecting his own Irish Whig heri- tage and the influence of Thorpe’s thinking), a compact that could not be  altered without the consent of the governed. This latter point represented  a position close to that of the English reformist and radical Whigs of the  mid-eighteenth century.49 Here were the seeds of what became in a short  time the reformers’ manifesto for the grant of responsible government.
 That having been said, it can also be argued that the efforts of colo- nial jurists to champion judicial independence were not entirely in vain,  whether in a substantive or symbolic sense. The short-lived judicial careers  of men such as Thorpe and Willis were important in pointing the way to  necessary changes in the imperial constitution and the role of the  judiciary  in the colonial state. Judges such as Smith and Beaumont provided  impetus C o p yr ig h t  m at er ia l f ro m w w w .p al g ra ve co n n ec t. co m  - li ce n se d  t o  U n iv er si te ts b ib ke t i T ro m so e  - P al g ra ve C o n n ec t  - 20 11
 The peoples indigenous to North America did not view sovereignty or  kings this way. These were non-state societies governed through councils  of chiefs and elders representing networks of clans or extended families  within and between villages. Political order was intimately connected to  spiritual order, and both were oriented toward relations of kinship. Kinship  transcended temporal and physical boundaries: trees, water, and animals  were infused with spiritual life—with manitous—and survival necessitated  spiritual balance with them through constant gift-giving. Peaceful rela- tions with the elements of the natural world and peoples within that world  meant establishing and maintaining relationships of spiritual-kinship by  creating reciprocal obligations of care. To give or receive presents was to  renounce the status of alien and to become kin. The snake-manitou met  by the Saulteurs on their way to Niagara was a grandfather and gifts were  needed to ensure its good thoughts. This episode is not unrelated to the  message of the Great Turtle given in the shaking tent, that the Crown’s  representative would fill their canoes with presents. To establish political  relations was to create obligations of care between members of an extended C o p yr ig h t  m at er ia l f ro m w w w .p al g ra ve co n n ec t. co m  - li ce n se d  t o  U n iv er si te ts b ib ke t i T ro m so e  - P al g ra ve C o n n ec t  - 20 11
 -0 3- The parliamentary committee, therefore, had ample evidence before it  of the distinctive aboriginal language from Canada of Crown as father.  But the report itself reveals no outward signs that the committee appreci- ated the traditional meaning of that phrase for indigenous peoples, and  its recommendations were wholly consistent with Crown paternalism of  the common law parens patriæ variety. That indigenous peoples in Canada  themselves referred to the Crown as father seems to have reinforced the com- mittee’s vision of the Crown as protector of aboriginal peoples throughout  the empire, if only indirectly or implicitly. In its reports in later years, the  successor to the select parliamentary committee on aborigines, the (extra- parliamentary) Aborigines Protection Society, would continue to advo- cate paternal Crown control of indigenous peoples in British colonies and  would use to this end statements from Indian chiefs in Canada expressing  thanks for the protection of their “great mother the Queen.”56 The pater- nalistic and moralistic ideas advanced by these groups were received sym- pathetically in a colonial office run by the likes of Lord Glenelg and James  Stephen, humanitarians closely linked by family ties to Wilberforce and  the Clapham Sect.57 Over time, this brand of moralistic paternalism would  be woven with other strands into the theory and practice of empire.58 On  an abstract level, it would inform theories of liberal imperialism developed  by utilitarians such as J.S. Mill.59 In practical terms, it would justify par- ticularly aggressive—indeed oppressive and abusive—government policies,  such as the Indian residential school system aimed at the forced assimila- tion of aboriginal peoples into Euro-Canadian society.60
 -0 3- thus took place in and through the movement of particular “official” per- sonages: governors, lawyers, missionaries, soldiers, and magistrates. It is  no surprise then that the office through which the combined authority of  Anglicanism and common law was concretely exercised in England—the  dual office of clergyman and justice of the peace—should have had such  decisive importance for the exercise of this authority in colonial Australia  and New Zealand. It was as the occupant of this double office that Samuel  Marsden (1765–1838) earned his celebrated or notorious place in the his- tory of colonial Australia and New Zealand. He personified the mix of  evangelical rectitude and judicial implacability that was required by the  “character” of his office, even though this has been reduced to the level  of personal foible by an often unsympathetic later historiography. At first,  especially before the Macquarie years, Marsden’s character was, naturally  enough, largely judged by his fellow settlers as a function of his person- ality. It was after all a society in which roles were unclearly differentiated  and taken ad hoc by those who would and could fill them; and so appear- ance, energy, and temperament counted for much. Few appreciated his  office and character: what he lived for and habitually practiced. What is  remarkable is that a politics (and later, a historiography) of personality  continued to provide the frame for judging Marsden’s actions, even after  New South Wales had become an extended society in which offices and  personae had become, in fact, more determinative than individual temper- ament. In attempting to understand the early stages of the transmission of  English legal and religious culture to New South Wales, then, it is vital to  study the man’s office and the character cultivated for it, without reducing  these to personal foible, for it is in the character of pioneers—the auctors of  a new or transplanting society—that lodge the deep structures of control  that they bring with them.
 Many of Marsden’s generation, though, did support the export of  protestant Christianity.4 In London in May 1809, Rev. Legh Richmond  preached to the annual meeting of the Church Missionary Society to  Africa and the East (CMS). He took as his text the injunction of Jesus in  John 11:16 to “Feed my sheep.” He urged his hearers to extend their finan- cial support to the organization’s ramifying missions and to pray for their  success. One of his congregation, Marsden himself was home, busy orga- nizing an Anglican mission to New Zealand. In his sermon, with a strik- ing eloquence that was long remembered,5 Richmond, appropriately to the  occasion, imagined a “statesman,” a “merchant,” a “natural philosopher,”  and a “curious traveler” examining a world map from their separate points  of view. (It is notable that he did not imagine a “colonist,” an uncommon  and unattractive figure at the time).6 The Christian “beholds the world’s  map” in a very different way from the others. “He has a subject of investi- gation far beyond them all. What they have overlooked and disregarded,  is everything to him.” He looks for “the visible kingdom of Christ”; then  he will see “how small a part of those immense tracts of country which the  map presents to his view, so much as know whether there be any Christ!” In fact Marsden had seen the world exactly this way when he first left  for New South Wales in 1793. His diary of the seven-month voyage out  records his single-minded commitment to bring the gospel to the convicts  and to the heathen natives of “New Holland.”7 The salvation of souls was  to be his life’s work. So it was not a new man who left England for the last  time in 1809 to the strains of the “Old Hundredth” Psalm.8 It was simply  one who was reinvigorated by an eighteen-month stay in his homeland  and who now had further flocks in mind: the New Zealanders, and the  growing numbers of convict, free, and freed settlers in New South Wales.
 -0 3- to social order.15 Even Marsden was capable of a Gibbonesque remark: “It  is well known that all civilizations have found it expedient for the mainte- nance of good government . . . to inculcate upon the minds of their subjects  all due respect for  religion, whether their national religion were false or  true.”16 To a man, the chaplains’ friends in England supported Pitt’s repres- sion of radicalism at home.17
 Under Hunter and King, Marsden was among the most prominent  magistrates of the colony, burdened with a great number of administra- tive as well as pastoral and judicial tasks. His experience led him to offer  his thoughts in three extended papers around 1806, intended for King,  his successor William Bligh, and the authorities in England.22 The papers  discussed unmarried convict women living with men, the toleration of  the Catholic religion among the Irish convicts, and the trade in spirituous  liquors. As a recent writer has shown, Marsden’s opinion of the morals and  law-abidingness of convict women was low; he disapproved of the military  élite’s trading and monopoly in hard liquor as a medium of exchange; and  most of all he abhorred the Irish Catholic convicts.23 Each was excoriated  as a corrupting source of sin and crime.
 -0 3- Hunter and King felt the same about the Irish: the two continually com- plained to Downing Street of those among them who were sent out for their  parts in the 1798 rebellion. They were “ignorant, obstinate, and depraved,”  “turbulent and worthless characters,” “insolent, refractory, and troublesome,”  “perjurers,” “wicked and disaffected,” “discontented,” and of “troublesome  spirit.” Above all they were “seditious.”24 Marsden, reflecting on his and his  fellow magistrates’ experience of Irish unrest,25 wrote in his Irish paper: The Toleration of the Catholic Religion would not only be dangerous to  the present Inhabitants; and to the Government; but also to the rising  Generation; and would lay the Foundation for future internal Wars and  commotions. The Catholics who have Children . . . would bring them up  in their own Persuasion; and would instil into their Minds all the Hatred  against Church and State, which they themselves possess.
 School teachers would join the clergy in that task: “Men of tolerable  Education and good Morals, who would willing devote their time and  Study to instruct the rising Generation.” Marsden was, then, an integrationist, pursuing a protestant and rural  ideal. He considered it possible to transform the population by the appli- cation of a non-doctrinal ethical Christianity, hardly considering, until  much later, possible Catholic, dissenter, and even Methodist objections to  the Anglican church’s dominating the colony. And these sentiments were  consistent with his record. He had recruited schoolteachers and (mainly  dissenting) pastors for New South Wales among the LMS refugees from  Tahiti and Tonga and organized their payment by both governors and the  Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. He had agitated for the building  and maintenance of churches and schools. He had played a major part in  the founding of a female orphan school, and a female factory for secluding  and educating young women in useful productive skills. In London he was  to promote the continuation and extension of his program of Christian  education and the reform of sexual relations.40

 Mackerel was a vindictive passerby in one of many early modern English  towns. In New South Wales in 1795, the brawl between Boston and the  New South Wales Corps constituted a much more obvious and important  rupture of the illusion of universal Peace. Boston v Laycock occurred in a  nascent colonial town: the only place where a plausible imitation of order  could be maintained. It involved some of the most important and notori- ous free men in the colony: free businessmen and members of the New  South Wales Corps. They represented two major and opposing interests  in a settlement largely comprised of convict men and women who them- selves constituted a threat to public order. When the parties to Boston v  Laycock brawled, everyone saw. When they disagreed in court over how  best to keep the Peace, everyone heard. Indeed, as the participants knew  as much about the law as most of their lay judges, their arguments carried  disproportionate weight in the colony. If Mackerel’s urination showed the  contestability of Peace in early modern England, then this public spat in  early Sydney shook the little colony at its legal foundations.
 These proposals were often aimed at generating commercial and, par- ticularly, political interest and support. To build political coalitions and  to present a “respectable” face to government and the public, promoters  stressed the moral and economic independence offered by emigration as  well as the greater freedom of action offered by colonial settings. In the  case of South Australia and New Zealand, many promoters of coloniza- tion were loosely connected through support for various ideas of “colonial  reform” and “systematic colonization.”4 Such proposals were not without  their critics, particularly given the questionable credentials of prominent  promoters such as Edward Gibbon Wakefield. In British debates colonies  could be presented as being socially fragile, bereft of the stability that long- standing institutions of law, religion, and property might be seen as giv- ing a society. To try to counter such perceptions, systematic colonization  proposals often involved detailed proposals for institutional structures and  constitutional relationships. Such proposals were designed to show respect- able authorship and provide assurances of colonial stability.5
 -0 3- Altering the law on oaths and evidence had been a recurrent issue among  lobbyists and commentators on imperial affairs in the early nineteenth cen- tury. Issues of slave and indigenous evidence were often of concern to the  Colonial Office. A series of contentious reforms in 1809 and again in 1828  allowed limited categories of unsworn testimony in the Cape Colony, as  part of attempts to assert control over and anglicize Cape institutions and  social structures.17 As Russell Smandych has explored, following the aboli- tion of slavery the office sought to prevent colonial assemblies, restricting  the admissibility of evidence by ex-slaves.18
 Ostensibly “philanthropist” groups set up in association with the South  Australian colonization scheme advocated allowing unsworn indigenous  testimony.19 However, the testimonial capacity of Aborigines was of lim- ited concern to the South Australian lobbyists before the colony’s founding  legislation was passed in 1834. Colonization plans reflected intellectual  currents, but they also reflected political pressures and preoccupations.  The metropolitan promoters of South Australia focused on convicts and   irregular settlers as the colonial challenges facing their schemes. Aboriginal  rights emerged as a late and hurriedly addressed issue.20 However, a  number of systematic colonization lobbyists from the South Australian  scheme moved on to formulate proposals for New Zealand settlements.21  The volume of information available in Britain about New Zealand and  the level of interest in Māori society encouraged promoters to theorize  how Māori society might interact with colonial government and society,  and to use such theorizing as part of political lobbying. Admitting Māori  testimony became a stock means of claiming an informed and “enlight- ened” approach to colonization.22 Nonetheless, references to evidentiary  capacity in colonization proposals had limited impact on government. In  1838 Lord Glenelg deflected New Zealand Company proposals for the  admission of Māori evidence in any new colonial system, saying the issue  was too sensitive to be resolved in the abstract.23 Imperial legislation was  predominately reactive. In the absence of a particular political controversy  there was limited political will to respond to abstract appeals to principle  from London observers, particularly given the self-interest of promoters  seeking to purchase land directly from Māori.24

 Th e Puritanism and Science thesis certainly has its critics. Lotte Mulligan argues that the distinct interest in science was held not only by Puritans but also by Anglican royalists. Furthermore, she argues that those characteristics which Webster termed ‘Puritan’ could equally be found among non-Puritans.46 James and Margaret Jacob make the criticism that the dichotomy that Webster pos- ited between Puritan science on the one hand, and the state-supported science of the Royal Society on the other, is unconvincing.47 Th ey argue instead that there existed a connection between the two, which manifested itself in a reform- ist dimension to the science pursued by members of the Royal Society. Boyle, together with John Wilkins, John Wallis, Christopher Wren and John Evelyn, ‘continued to advocate and engage in the organized pursuit of experimental sci- ence. But they dissociated this project from any radical reform of the church, state, the economy or society’.48 Rather, their Anglican reformism was manifested in a language of improvement, in order to inspire commerce and food production.
 Th e administration of the colonies provided much cause for discontent.
 Th e fi rst is that Bacon did not use the word to denote England’s overseas territo- ries. In the early to mid seventeenth century, the meaning of ‘empire’ as territorial dominion of course existed, deriving from the Roman tradition in which ‘empire’ referred to Rome and her colonies. Th e key point here is the diff erence between ‘empire’ as a straightforward concrete noun, and empire as an abstract noun. At the time Bacon wrote, empire denoting a set of overseas colonies was used only to refer to the Roman Empire. It was not used to refer to England’s patchwork of Atlantic colonies until much later in the seventeenth century.3
 Comenius termed this idea Pansophia13 and articulated it best in his Reformation of Schooles (1642) and Th e Great Didactic (1657).
 Another avid reader of Bullock’s book was Benjamin Worsley, a physician who fi rst came into contact with Hartlib in the 1640s when they were both members of the Invisible College, an association of like-minded utopian puritans.27 Worsley developed a keen interest and involvement in colonies and their administration.
 Th e reference to the ‘English nation at home and abroad’ indicates a second signifi cance of the Americas for the Hartlib Circle’s project. Not only was the New World the location for recovering Eden, but the American colonies would also aid England’s struggle against the Catholic powers by providing a source of wealth. In 1658 the Church of England clergyman John Beale wrote to Hartlib about the necessity of colonies for the advancement of the world: ‘Wee should with mutuall endevours set our hearts to advance them; all true-hearted old Puritans to advance Newe England: all true Parliamentarians together with the men of the olde forme to advance Virginia & and her confi ners; & our Protector to advance Iamaica, as the concernment of his greate fathers honour.’42
 In 1649, Parliament passed the Ordinance for the Advancement of Civili- zation and Christianity among the Indians, which created the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England. When the Society was incorpo- rated as the New England Company in 1661, Boyle became its fi rst governor.15
 Put simply, England had adopted the Protestant mantle for mankind.
 Perhaps one of the best contexts in which to examine the continuity between Boyle’s theology and his colonial involvement is that of the attempts to proselyt- ize indigenous peoples, whether they be Amerindians, the Irish or the Indians in India. Originally a Puritan endeavour during the Commonwealth, the Res- toration endowed the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, renamed the New England Company, with respectability. As James Jacob has suggested, this is perhaps one of the reasons Boyle was appointed as the Governor of the New England Company; he was a member of the established Church, as well as a close friend and ally of Clarendon.64 In a letter to the Commissioners of the United Colonies of New England in May 1662, probably draft ed by Henry Ashurst but approved by Boyle, he explained that the king had granted a charter for incorpo- rating the New England Company. Th is would mean that ‘many of the Nobility and other persons of Quality and most of those Gentlemen that were imployed in the like worke are Authorized and appointed to endeavour the carrying on that pious designe of converting the heathen natives’.65
 England’s New World colonies were of course not the only places with which the Society communicated. An examination of the Oldenburg correspondence, for example, illustrates the extent of Oldenburg’s own, and the Society’s, Euro- pean correspondence. Th e New World, however, did play a signifi cant role in the Society’s information-gathering projects. Th is was in no small part due to the fact that a number of English colonists were eager to be correspondents.
 Although the Society proudly proclaimed a unifying motto, Nullius in Verba (roughly, ‘on no man’s word’), it would be wrong to assume that all members of the Royal Society shared the same ideas about the Society’s projects. Th e member- ship of the early Royal Society was varied, socially as well as on religious grounds.8
 Th e American colonies played a central role in the project of collecting speci- mens. Many of the Society’s most reliable correspondents were stationed in the colonies and, furthermore, the colonies’ position on trade routes facilitated the trans-Atlantic shipping of artefacts. Approximately two-thirds of the objects in Hans Sloane’s personal collection, for example, had an American provenance,60

 Some Protestant Reformers would not agree with Vasari’s criticism  of the medieval Church’s destruction of ancient artwork, there being a  strong iconoclastic streak in early Protestantism. They would no doubt  approve that practice. Like the humanists, the Protestant Reformers  identified the Middle Ages with darkness that gave way to the light of  the Reformation. For Vasari’s English contemporary John Foxe (1516– 1587), the author of the great Protestant history of the English Church,  John Wyclif (1330–1384) was “the morning-star” of the Reformation, 18 Giorgio Vasari, “Selections,” The Italian Renaissance Reader, ed. Julia Conaway  Bondanella and Mark Musa (NY: Meridian, 1987), 385–386.
 In spite of the general disinterest of medievalists in examining early  modern political thought, at the beginning of the twentieth century  there was some research being done along those lines, but from an unex- pected perspective, the study of the medieval Church, especially the fif- teenth-century movement to create a conciliar structure to govern the  Christian Church. The great legal historian, Frederic William Maitland  (1850–1906) had asserted that: The medieval church was a state. Convenience may forbid us to call it a  state very often, but we ought to do so from time to time, for we could  frame no acceptable definition of a state which would not comprehend the  church. What has it not that a state should have? It has law, lawgivers, law  courts, lawyers.
 When the medieval church is regarded as a political organism, as a state, it  becomes very interesting. As a whole the constitution of this state may be  unique, but there is hardly a feature in it for which we may not find analo- gies elsewhere. At various points it becomes a model for the constitutions  of other and secular states.39
 John Neville Figgis, a student of Maitland, summed up Maitland’s  position tersely: in “the Middle Ages the Church was not a State, it was  the State….” Consequently, the great theoretical question that should  interest scholars is to understand the “change which substituted the civil  for the ecclesiastical authority….”40 In other words, so Figgis argued, the 39 Frederic William Maitland, Roman Canon Law in the Church of England (London:  Methuen, 1898), 100.

 throne and imposed the Lombard monk Lanfranc (ca. 1005–1089) as  archbishop of Canterbury, replacing the Saxon archbishop, Stigand, as  well as most bishops and abbots, and enforcing the Gregorian reforms  that centralized the Roman Church on the previously semi-autonomous  English Church.8
 According to Hume, not satisfied with imposing feudalism on the free  Saxons, William also brought into England something else, a “doctrine  which exalted the papacy above all human power,” that is the canon law  that placed the pope at the apex of a universal legal system and consti- tuted him the chief and unchallenged head of the Church. He did this  because the papacy had blessed his invasion of England. The goal was to  “break the spiritual as well as civil independency of the Saxons, who had  hitherto conducted their ecclesiastical government, with an acknowledg- ment indeed of primacy in the see of Rome, but without much idea of its  title to dominion or authority.”31 The consequence of William’s actions  was to keep “united the civil and ecclesiastical powers” in a wicked con- spiracy to keep the English in permanent submission.32
 Power” and so subjugated the clergy to their yoke just as the laity had  been.38
 developed, the situation changed. According to Berthoff and Murrin, by  1730 “the older colonies had become populous enough to make the old  feudal claims incredibly lucrative.”69 “As in France, the feudal revival in  the English colonies employed old legal and social forms for quite single- mindedly modern purposes.”70 What was happening in France, the rip- ping of “feudal relationships out of their original context” in order to  seize “what surviving obligations could be enforced for the income they  might produce” was also taking place in the British colonies in North  America.”71 Strictly speaking, if Berthoff and Murrin are correct, what  was on the upswing in North America, was the economic side of the feu- dal order that is manorialism.
 … the apprehension of Episcopacy contributed fifty years ago, as much as  any other cause, to arouse the attention, not only of the inquiring mind,  but of the common people, and urge them to close thinking on the consti- tutional authority of parliament over the colonies.1
 law and Martin Luther even publicly burned copies of canon law in a  bonfire designed to mark the end of the old church.3 In practice, canon  law was employed as a synonym for ecclesiastical oppression that cor- rupted both spiritual and political communities.
 In terms of the Norman Yoke, canon law recalled the role of the  papacy in supporting William the Conqueror’s invasion of England,  support symbolized by Pope Alexander II’s (1061–1073) blessing of  a banner borne before William at the battle of Hastings.4 The price of  this support was the Conqueror’s agreement to reform the Church in  England according to the principles of the Gregorian Reform move- ment.5 The visible sign of this alliance was the appointment of the Italian  scholar and monk Lanfranc (c. 1005–1089) as archbishop of Canterbury,  replacing the Saxon Stigand who had been excommunicated.6
 From the perspective of Adams, as feudalism destroyed the political  structure of Anglo-Saxon society, reducing the people to serfdom, so the  church reform movement of the eleventh and twelfth centuries destroyed  the Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical structure. The reformed Church’s heavy  emphasis on papal universal administrative jurisdiction, symbolized by 6 On Lanfranc: see Margaret Gibson, Lanfranc of Bec (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978);  H.E.J. Cowdrey, Lanfranc: Scholar, Monk, and Archbishop (Oxford: Oxford University  Press, 2003).
 5 The papacy had a long history of involvement with English monarchs stretching back  to the mission sent by Pope Gregory I in 596. A modern scholar has suggested that even  the Church reformers such as Gregory VII allowed William and his immediate successors  a great deal of room to intervene in ecclesiastical matters, even to the extent that “William  the Conqueror, his sons, and perhaps grandson, Henry II, dominated what could be called  a national church.” See Uta-Renate Blumenthal, The Investiture Controversy: Church and  Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania  Press, 1988), 153; see also Kathleen G. Cushing, Reform and the Papacy in the Eleventh  Century: Spirituality and Social Change (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2005), 77.
 uniformity of ritual and the development of a canon law for the entire  Church, spelled the end of a kind of primitive Church institutionally dis- tinct from Rome for the most part.7
 The deposition of Stigand (d. 1072) as archbishop of Canterbury  and appointment of Lanfranc (1005–1089), an Italian scholar who had  become a monk in Normandy and who was associated with the reform  movement, signaled the imposition of the Gregorian Reform move- ment in England.9 Subsequently almost all of the bishops of the Saxon  Church were deposed and replaced by Norman clerics just as virtually all  major Saxon landholders were replaced by William’s followers. Lanfranc  enforced the strict ecclesiastical discipline associated with the Church  reform, celibacy of the clergy for example, in place of what the papacy  saw as the relaxed standards of the church in Saxon England.10

 Years later (1815) Adams went on to admit that such concern about  the importance of fears about the creation of an Anglican diocese in  North America on the eve of the Revolution would be hard to accept  in a country which now possessed bishops of various sorts, Methodist,  Anglican and even “bishops, archbishops, and Jesuits of the church of  Rome.”12 It was a measure of the changes that had taken place between  1765 and 1815 that Adams was forced to explain why he believed that  the colonists had been driven to revolution by fears of bishops.
 The writer to whom he was referring was Jonathan Mayhew, who had  criticized the policy of the Society for Propagating the Gospel [SPG] for  sending its missionaries into already Christian New England instead of  into the lands of the infidel Indians.17 To Mayhew and his fellow New  Englanders such as Adams the SPG was yet another instrument for  imposing British imperial control on the colonists rather than a vehicle  for missionary work among the Indians. As colonial self-government 16 Adams, Papers, 1: 127–128. 17 Alan Heimert has suggested that the fact “the legend [of Mayhew’s importance] per- sists despite this record is probably testimony to the effectiveness of John Adams’ remi- niscences,” where he labeled Mayhew the “fifth most important spokesman” for what  Adams termed “American principles.” Alan Heimart, Religion and the American Mind:  From the Great Awakening to the Revolution (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1966),  290–291.

 was being undercut by Parliament’s claim to be able to tax the colonists  without their consent, so too, colonial self-government in ecclesiastical  affairs, the right of the congregation to select its own minister, would  be ended if the discipline of the Anglican Church were to be imposed in  New England through the establishment of diocesan administration.
 The debate about having a bishop had a long history because it dealt  with the very nature of the Christian Church. The Puritans saw the  retention of bishops and a hierarchical church structure by the Church  of England as the most obvious sign of that Church’s incomplete accept- ance of the Reformation. Removing to America, the Puritans could  remain members of the Church of England but could create a church  structure that they believed to be more in keeping with the structure of  the early church than was the episcopal model. The congregational and  presbyterian structures as they developed in British North America were  attempts to re-create the structure of the early church. The settlement  of America was, therefore, part of the continuous process of freeing men  from the burdens of medieval ecclesiastical tyranny that had begun in the  sixteenth century, a process that paralleled the task of freeing men from  their feudal bonds. This process reached its climax in England: under the execrable race of the Steuarts, the struggle between the people  and the confederacy aforesaid of temporal and spiritual tyranny, became  formidable, violent and bloody.18
 The purpose of colonizing North America “seems to have been to  establish a government of the church more consistent with the scrip- tures, and a government of the state more agreeable to the dignity of  human nature ….” In order to achieve those goals the encrustations of  feudal and ecclesiastical laws had to be identified and removed. Just as  the creation of a proper political structure required the dismantling of  feudal law and the governmental institutions that had developed during  the Middle Ages, so the establishment of “a church more consistent with  the Scriptures” would require dismantling the medieval church’s law  and institutional structure that the Church of England had retained.19  Furthermore, just as Adams’s arguments about the nature and evils of 18 Adams, Papers, 1: 113. 19 Ibid., 1: 115–116.
 In the Dissertation on the Canon and the Feudal Law, Adams assumed  that his readers were acquainted with the history of the Church as the  Protestant reformers had presented it. That history generally contrasted  the Christian community of the first three centuries with the medieval  Church. Broadly speaking, that history showed the Church as pass- ing through a series of stages in the 1500 years before the Protestant  Reformation. The first stage was that of the early Church, a voluntary  community that had no connection with the state. The second stage  began with the legalization of Christianity by the Emperor Constantine  in 311. This began a period of gradual decline from the simplicity of the  primitive Church as the leaders of the Church, now favored by the impe- rial government, lost their zeal and virtue.
 In the tenth and eleventh centuries, as feudalism was emerging from  the ruins of the Roman world to create a wicked political order, so  too the papacy was emerging out of the decaying remains of the early  Church to impose canon law on the Christian people. From then until  the Reformation of the sixteenth century, the papacy and its corrupt sys- tem dominated the Christian Church. There were, however, always those  who opposed the papal system and were forerunners of the sixteenth- century Reformers. The Reformation was, according to this view of  Christian history, a return to the primitive form of Christianity, a return  to the roots of the Church as it existed before the bishops of Rome came  to seize control of it and corrupt it.20
 of the corrupted Middle Ages and the papally-led Catholic Church pro- vided the ecclesiastical system, canon law, for that era.
 In the English-speaking world, the most important source of the  Reformers version of Church history was John Foxe [1516–1587],  whose Acts and Monuments or Book of Martyrs provided Englishmen with  the history of the early and the medieval church in general and the his- tory of the English church in particular.22 Curiously, Foxe’s work had  developed along the lines that Hume’s History was to develop, that is,  he began with the more recent period and then, in later editions, added  medieval material. In the edition of 1559, Foxe began withJohn Wyclif  (1320–1384), the English theologian and heretic whom he termed the  “morning star” of the Reformation.23 In the edition of 1570, Foxe had  added material dealing with the early history of the Church, the bringing  of Christianity to England in the days of the Apostles and the develop- ment of Christianity in England on through the Middle Ages. The result  was another important addition to the knowledge of the Middle Ages  available to Englishmen.
 Haller’s book on Foxe and his earlier The Rise of Puritanism (New York: Columbia  University Press, 1938) are fundamental to understanding the historical outlook of the  Puritans, both at home and abroad in the colonies.
 When Adams came to discuss the evils of the medieval Church, the  canon law system, he did not have to provide his readers with the details  of the historical development involved. He could simply point to the  corruption of the Catholic Church as the end product of the develop- ment. The settlers of North America, the ancestors of his readers, had  rejected the medieval church and all its corruptions.
 In effect, Adams was condemning the entire Catholic development  of the theology of the sacraments, especially Holy Orders, that had  occurred during the Middle Ages and which was seen by Protestants  as central to the clergy’s domination of Christian society. The clergy 58, 128; L.B. Wright, The Cultural Life of the American Colonies: 1607–1763 (New York:  Harper, 1957), 133.
 The institutional consequence of this sacramental theology that  Adams condemned was “the whole system of Diocesan episcopacy,” the  regular administrative structure of the medieval church by which every  Christian lived within a diocese and a parish, under the supervision of a  bishop and a parish priest.29 In this way, the superstructure of priests and  bishops sat upon one shoulder of the masses and the feudal hierarchy on  the other. In a weakened form, many of these corruptions existed within  the Church of England according to its critics.
 When the first colonists came to Massachusetts Bay, they rejected this  sacramental theology and its institutional consequence, the diocesan  structure. Instead of basing the power of the clergy on “the ridiculous  fancies of sanctified effluvia from episcopal fingers, they established sac- erdotal ordination, on the foundation of the bible and common sense.”  The result was the formation of a body of clergy characterized by “indus- try, virtue, piety and learning” instead of forming “a sordid, stupid,  wretched herd” as did the Roman clergy. The reformed clergy were, as  a result, “infinitely more independent on the civil powers, in all respects  than they could be where they were formed into a scale of subordination,  from a pope down to priests and fryars and confessors ….”30 The result  was an educated and free clergy more in keeping with the biblical model  of the clergy than with the medieval papal model. His theme was the for- mation of a republican church for a republican people.
 Adams’s emphasis on the independence of the clergy in New England  reflected what he saw as the most dangerous aspect of the medieval  church, its relationship with secular power, the conspiracy of canon and  feudal law to oppress the great bulk of the members of society for their  own selfish interests. The colonists: had an utter contempt of all that dark ribaldry of hereditary, indefeasible  right-the Lord’s anointed-and the divine, miraculous original of govern- ment, with which the priesthood had enveloped the feudal monarch in  clouds and mysteries, and from whence they had deduced the most mis- chievous of all doctrines, that of passive obedience and non resistance.
 The key to retaining liberty in both church and state was knowledge.  Not only did the colonists create a political and ecclesiastical system  that was designed to prevent the re-creation of feudal and canonical sys- tems in North America, they created educational institutions that would  insure the continuation of that state of affairs.
 In arguing thus, Adams neatly reversed the wicked alliance of feudal and  canon law that characterized the Middle Ages and the Stuart era. In New  England, the clergy side with liberty and with the people against gov- ernmental oppression and the enslavement of the people. As long as the  clergy are learned and their congregations composed of educated people,  feudal and ecclesiastical oppression cannot exist in the colonies in spite of  English pressure. The clergy are to call the people to liberty rather than  convincing them that slavery is their appointed lot in life. They are in  effect to play a role directly opposed to that of the medieval clergy.
 How real was Adams’s fear that the British government was planning  to erect an Anglican diocese in North America with all of its attendant  evils? On the one hand, there was strong interest among some segments  of the Church of England to establish formal church control over the  American churches by establishing a diocese.35 This generated a great  deal of apprehension on the part of at least some of the Americans, that  if a diocese was created the Independent churches of New England  would lose their independence and become subject to episcopal control.  This fear was accentuated by the submission of a number of well-known  clerics to the Church of England as well as accepting Anglican ordination  in the 1720s. These individuals subsequently became active in the move- ment to bring a bishop to the colonies, forming a kind of fifth column  undermining the colonial intention to remain free of episcopal control.  If the Anglican Church became the established church in America, more  clerics might submit and the Independent churches would be forced to  accept Anglican discipline or to fade away. In New England, above all,  the Independents would lose their own established status with its finan- cial and political advantages.
 The increasing activity of the SPG in New England during the 1760s  led to even more fear of episcopacy. Years later, Adams wrote that when  the Reverend East Apthorp: 34 Ibid., 1: 126. 35 Cross, 144–147; Woolverton, 220–225.
 The reference to Lambeth of course accentuated the threat because  Lambeth Palace was the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the head  of the Church of England under the king. Adams was suggesting here  not simply that the appointment of a single bishop was feared but the  creation of an extensive hierarchy of bishops under an archbishop. Such  a situation would not only be oppressive ecclesiastically but economically  as well. A clerical hierarchy would require income suitable to its members  rank and station just as the rank and status of the crown’s secular officials  required incomes from taxes on the colonists.
 If Adams and his contemporaries pointed to the actions of the  Anglicans alone on the issue of an American episcopate, then perhaps  one might be inclined to reject their fears as excessive. The end of the  wars with France that brought all of French Canada under British con- trol in 1763, however, posed another threat on the religious front. The  inhabitants of French Canada were of course Catholics and the treaty  that ended the war contained provisions that protected the Catholic  Church from interference. This did not appeal to the New Englanders  who had long feared invasion from Canada by Frenchmen and Indians  aroused to slaughter New England Protestants by their priests. When  he came to reflect on the importance of the debate about an American  episcopate fifty years later, John Adams pointed to the Quebec Act of  1774 which granted official standing to the Catholic Church in Canada,  making it in effect an established Church.37 From this later perspective  Adams saw his fear of episcopacy in British North America as confirmed.  If the British government was going to accept the Catholic Church with  its bishops as the established religion of a body of its subjects in Canada,  what could possibly hold the government back from creating a diocese  of the Church of England for its American colonists who were, presuma- bly, already members of the Church of England? From the perspective of 36 Adams, Letter to J. Morse, Works, 10: 187; see also Bridenbaugh, 211–212. 37 Adams, Letter to J. Morse, Works, 10: 188. For the terms of the Act: see “The Quebec Act,” Commager, Documents, 74–76.
 Americans like Adams, the differences between Roman Catholicism and  the Church of England were not really very great. There was also always  the fear that the Church of England would reunite with Rome, a fear  that had fanned the conflict with the Stuarts, even to the point of accus- ing Archbishop Laud, who hated the Catholic Church, of being a secret  Catholic.38 The eventual return of the Stuart family to the Catholic  Church provided more evidence of the existence of a Catholic conspiracy  at the highest levels of English government.39
 It is important to realize at this point that Adams’s experience with  Catholics, above all priests and bishops, was derived from his reading  of history. He never encountered a bishop in the flesh until his mis- sion to France during the Revolution when he encountered priests and  bishops in some numbers at the French court. Furthermore, after the  Revolution, he was proud of his role in assisting the formation of the  Episcopal Church in the United States.40 His opposition, so it would  seem, was not so much to bishops in the flesh as bishops in history.
 39 James II had become a Catholic secretly before ascending the throne and his second  wife was a Catholic French princess. The last Stuart was a cardinal of the Roman Church,  Henry Benedict Stuart (1725–1807). On the later Stuarts and Catholicism: see Geoffrey  Scott, “The court as a centre of Catholicism,” in Edward Corp, A Court in Exile: The  Stuarts in France, 1689–1718 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004): 234–256.
 Writing in Elizabethan England, Foxe stressed the subordination of  the church to the state and of all subjects, even priests and bishops,  to royal justice. At the same time, he was also critical of the way in  which Becket’s death had occurred. The four knights who had actually 48 Ibid., 2: 196–197. 49 Ibid.
 John Foxe and the other polemical historians of the sixteenth century,  along with the antiquarians who discovered, edited, and published the  relevant documents, provided later historians with the materials from  which they could write the history of the Middle Ages without, they  claimed, entering into the confessional wars involving scholars from the  different Christian denominations. At the same time, the secular-minded  historians of the Enlightenment tended to follow in the footsteps of the  Protestant historians of the Reformation when it came to understand- ing and judging the medieval church. They too despised bishops, con- demned the entire papally directed ecclesiastical structure, and generally  sided with secular rulers when dealing with the medieval Church-State  conflict. Historians in the tradition of the philosophes were not, however,  interested in supporting the arguments of Protestant historians about  how the sixteenth century saw a return to pure, primitive Christianity.  What the philosophes did assert, however, was the need to return to the  virtuous polity that existed before the barbarian invasions and the rise  of the Christian Church. Like the Protestant historians, the philosophes  were interested in returning to a purer antiquity, in this case the Roman  Republic, not the church communities described in the Acts of the  Apostles.
 Even if Adams and his contemporaries did not read Foxe, they did  read about the medieval English church in a variety of histories that  were not ostensibly devoted either to medieval or to ecclesiastical his- tory. When Paul de Rapin-Thoyras came to examine the conflict between  Henry II and Becket, he painted the contrast between the goals of  the bishops and those of the king in even starker terms than Foxe. He  pointed to the way in which: the power of the Clergy was increase’d to the Prejudice of the Royal  Authority. Henry, who had seen very bad effects of it in the Reign of  Stephen, resolv’d upon his Accession to the Crown to do his Endeavour to  bring this exorbitant Power within due Bounds.
 For eighteenth-century Americans like John Adams and his contem- poraries, bishops like Thomas Becket were the bishops they knew and  feared. Even though the twelfth-century Archbishop of Canterbury  was chronologically much further removed from eighteenth-century  Boston than were the contemporary bishops and archbishops of the  Anglican Church, the fact that Becket played such a large role in the  histories that the colonial Americans read meant that when a polemi- cist like Adams wanted to arouse colonial Americans to oppose English  policies that could lead to an American episcopate, he would use those  images that were most inclined to move his audience in the direction he  wished them to go. Becket represented the worst possible politico-reli- gious situation. He was a leading member of the church that had cor- rupted the true Christian faith and he wanted to replace government by  kings with government by priests. He was far worse than the worst of the  Anglican bishops, even William Laud, the seventeenth-century scourge  of the Puritans. Laud, after all, fell, and with the subsequent fall of King  Charles I went the last hope of a Church-State relationship in England  like that of the medieval Church. For the Puritans, what was wrong with 76 On Langton’s important role in the creation of Magna Carta: see F.M. Powicke,  Stephen Langton (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1928), 112–114. Powicke’s position was  strongly criticized by H.G. Richardson and G.O. Sayles, The Governance of Mediaeval  England from the Conquest to Magna Carta (Edinburgh: University Press, 1963), vi, 363.  See also, John Hudson, “Magna and the ius commune, and English Common Law,” in  Magna Carta and the England of King John, ed. Janet S. Loengard (Woodbridge: Boydell  Press, 2010), 99–119.
 Laud was that he was, according to them, inclined toward Rome.78 At  best, or, perhaps more accurately, at worst, Laud was only a pale reflec- tion of the great evil bishops of the Middle Ages of whom Becket was  the exemplar.
 If the Americans had accepted this “power or pretended power,” then  they would have opened the floodgates of despotic parliamentary rule: But if parliament can erect dioceses and appoint bishops, they may intro- duce the whole hierarchy, establish tithes, forbid marriages and funerals,  establish religions, forbid dissenters, make schism heresy, [and] impose  penalties extending to life and limb as well as to liberty and property.83
 authority ….” Given these examples, it is not surprising that “in the same  predicament are the American colonies, and all the other dispersions of  the empire.”43
 The charter also pointed to “the reducing and Conversion of such sav- ages as remaine [there] … to Civil Societies and Christian Religion ….46
 independence of England but in its use against papal claims to univer- sal ecclesiastical jurisdiction. In the year following the Act of Appeals,  he issued an act separating the English Church from papal jurisdiction  and declaring the king “the supreme head of the Church of England,” in  effect uniting the temporal and the spiritual powers in the yoke.26
 Leonard assumed that the notion of the fullest expression of impe- rial power was present in the king in Parliament formula that was cre- ated only in the wake of the revolution of 1688–1689. Opposition to  the notion of the king in Parliament, and the consequent jurisdiction of  Parliament over the American colonies, “tends manifestly to independ- ence,” a status to which the colonies would logically arrive “did not  Great Britain check them” before that occurred.93
 they claimed to be devout Calvinists. Adams admitted that there was  no evidence that the members of the junto “ever directly solicited for  Bishops” but such an establishment would be a logical consequence of  “establishing the unlimited authority of parliament!”22 Thus the yoke  was not only tyrannical, it was generated corruption allowing officials  who served it to advance their own interests at the expense of their fel- low colonists.
 In arguing that there had been no long-term planning for the devel- opment of an overseas empire composed of colonial settlements estab- lished by English settlers, Adams was correct. The American colonies  had not been created as a result of deliberate imperial policy but to serve  the interests of various groups of English people. The current efforts to  impose direct parliamentary control over the colonies resulted from the  English government’s realization that there was “a defect in her govern- ment” that required attention. Such a correction should “be supply’d by  some just and reasonable means” which meant for Adams “the consent  of the Colonies ….” What Adams was calling for was a meeting where  colonists and royal officials could work out a kind of imperial constitu- tion that would recognize that the colonies had proved successful.63
 Adams’s empire was thus not a neatly arranged hierarchical structure  with the king of England and his Parliament at the peak directing and  coordinating all the elements of the empire towards a common goal as  Leonard would have it. Instead it was a collection of separate states each  of which possessed a unique relationship to the king of England alone,  based on its own history. Each of these constituent elements of the  king’s domain would have its own form of government, laws, and cus- toms, and, perhaps most important of all, its own economic and political  interests which could be in conflict with those other constituent states or  with the goals of the empire itself.
 Leonard’s claim to having a realistic view of the empire and of the col- onists’ place within it included recognizing that the empire was an insti- tution in a continual process of development. That being the case the  early charters and related documents associated with the establishment  of the colonies, the documents on which Adams based his arguments,  did not provide the governing principles of the empire’s colonial policy  in the eighteenth century. Massachusetts in 1775 was very different from  the small community founded in 1630 and the British government had  changed even more. In his opinion, the eighteenth-century inhabitants  of British North America could not expect that they would be treated as  if they were they still lived in the fragile seventeenth-century settlements  whose future was doubtful.
 The older arrangement of the territories labeled the British Empire  was quite satisfactory to Adams because it kept royal power widely dis- tributed and limited by the specific terms according to which the individ- ual lands were acquired. It was the drive to create a sovereign, unlimited  power, identified with the king in Parliament, that Adams opposed and  not the empire as such. In theory at least, there could have been a feder- ated form of empire. Under those circumstances, the power of the sov- ereign would be constrained in a fashion rather like the system of checks  and balances that Adams argued should be the basis of the American  constitutional structure.
 The historical record was important to Adams because it provided  tangible evidence of the structure and principles of English development.  It was on the solid ground of charters and other official documents and  the historically based common law, not the theories of eighteenth-cen- tury philosophers, that the English constitution developed. It was the  historical experience of the English people that created the governmental  structure so that those engaged in the debate about the nature of the  empire in the eighteenth century should first study that history.

 Lieutenant Governor John Simcoe found Freemasonry to be a verv useful institution when he established the seat of the colonial government in Niagara in 1792. A long-standing Freemason, Simcoe had been initiated in England in 1773 while an ensign in the 35th Regiment of Foot. Simcoe's overriding goal as governor was to ensure that Upper Canada developed a distinctly British, as opposed to American, tenor. Though the Constinnional Act of 1791 institu­ tionalized a political and legal system based on the British model, the settlement of so many people from the United States troubled the governor. "The utmost Attention;' Simcoe explained, "should be paid that British Customs, Manners, and Principles ... be promoted and inculcated;'59 To this end, he conferred British place names throughout the territory, vigorously promoted the estab­ lished church, and sought to develop a loyal colonial aristocracy. And he also encouraged a British instinition that was becoming closely associated with the British state, Freemasonry.
 Finally, the fact that Roman Catholic churches publicly associated with the fraternity demonstrates the entente between Freemasonry and Catholicism in late-eighteenth-century Ireland. In 1799 the Grand Lodge oflreland needed to raise funds for its Orphan School, so it organized a charity sermon at an Angli­ can church. At the same time it decided to ask "a Clergyman of the Romish Church ... to present a sermon in one of their Chapplcs in aid of the said School." The next year Lodge No. 60, working in Ennis, County Clare, ob­ served its annual St. John's Day celebration in a Catholic church and heard a sermon by the Reverend Patrick McDonogh, a high-ranking official of the diocese.25
 The significant participation of Catholics in British lodges of the eighteenth century calls into question Linda Colleys argument about the role of anti­ Catholicism in the forging of British national identity in the period between 1707 and 1837. [dentifying themselves vis-a-vis the French Catholic enemy and the subject populations of the British Empire, Britons, Colley argues, built their sense of nationalism on a foundation of "intolerant Protestantism." She identi­ ties anti-Catholicism as a hallmark of British national identity through the early nineteenth century.28 But Freemasons' willingness to include Catholics in their brotherhood, and even accept them as their leaders, points to a more tolerant attitude at work, at least by the last third of the eighteenth century. That Britons were not as stridently anti-Catholic as Colley claims is also demonstrated by the broader political context. The imperial Parliament passed legislation giving offi­ cial sanction to the Catholic institutions and traditions of French Canada in 1774 and preserved them for Lower Canada (Quebec) again in 1791 And prominent British politicians, including Pitt, Fox, and the Grenvilles, publicly supported the rights of Catholics ( and ushered Catholic relief acts through Parliament), even at a time when Britain was at war with France.
 Such policies were due, in part, to the hostile position of the Catholic Church.
 final!,-, Freemasonry provided a model for other societies that were explicitlv political. Especially in Ireland, societies like the Defenders, the Orange Order, and United Irishmen mimicked the lodge structure, practices, and fraternalisrn pioneered bv Freemasons.
 The United Irish Rebellion took place in the early months of 1798, sixteen ,-cars after the Volunteer ( citizen militia) movement had managed to secure a degree of legislati\'e independence for Ireland's Anglican ruling class, the Ascen­ d;mcv, under the leadership of Henry Grattan. The limited independence of "Crattan's Parliament," characterized by narrow Whig oligarchy, oversight bv the English government, and continued restrictions on the rights of Catholics and Dissenters, did not satisfy large sections oflrish society, notably Ulster Pres­ lwterians ,md middle-class Catholics. Both groups, as well as reform-minded Anglicans, found a forum for their grievances in the Society of United 1rishmen.
 Emerging in Belfast and then in Dublin on the heels of the French Revolution in I "91, the Societ\' championed the unrealized objectives of the Volunteers: the reform of l'arl iamellt and the enfranchisement of Catholics. As its name implied, the Society aimed to be nonsectarian and sought to provide a space that could ac�·ornmodate the manv varieties of lrishncss vving for political legitimacy in the l 7<)0S.
 Though the founders of the Society of United Irishmen did not use Drcn­ nan's "Irish Brotherhood" as the precise organizational model for the societv they established in Belfast in October 1791, thev did draw upon the discourse of fraternit\' evident in Drennan's writings. The United Irish constitlltion pro­ claimed that the society had been formed "for the purpose of forwarding a brotherhood of affection, a communion of rights, and an union of power among Irishmen of all religious persuasions, and thereby to obtain a complete reform in the legislature, founded on the principles of civil, political, and religious liberty." Similarly, each new member declared in the United Irish oath that he would help form and uphold this "brotherhood of affection" among all Irishmen regardless of their rcligion.04 In conceiYing of their organization as a brotherhood and in emphasizing religious toleration, the United Irishmen directlv associated them­ scl\'cs with Frcemasomy.
 British Freemasonry's associations with radicalism had become so significant that its leaders in England, Ireland, and Scotland had no choice but to try to take control of the brotherhood during the turbulent decades of the 1790s and r Soos. Nineteenth-century British Freemasonry could not absorb the diversity of political opinions evident in the brotherhood during the eighteenth ccnturv.
 Ireland did not undergo the processes of industrialization transforming En­ gland, Wales, and the Scottish lowlands in this period, and it did not have the urban outlets necessary to absorb an expanding population. Parts of Ireland, especially Ulster, became fertile ground for agrarian secret societies and rural protest mm·ements that sought to regulate the moral economv and redress perceived injustices. Ireland's Catholic majority had the most significant griev­ ances. In r 823 Daniel O'Connell founded the Catholic Association to agitate for Catholic emancipation and the repeal of the Union. Both political and agrarian violence escalated. Throughout this period, an insecure government addressed the situation by implementing coercive measures, including restrictive legisla­ tion and the introduction of the world's first modern police force, the Irish Constabularv. On top of all this, potent memories of ageless enmities between Ireland's competing religious communities fueled sectarian discord.
 The hostile attitude of the Catholic Church -which was obviously outside the control of Masonic authorities-contributed to Masonry's increasingly Protestant character. Although the Vatican had issued encyclicals against Free­ masonry in the eighteenth century, they were neither widely publicized nor strictly enforced in Ireland until the early I 800s. By the time Irish prelates made their congregations aware of the Church's position on Freemasonry, the Vatican had stepped up its efforts to curtail Catholics' participation in Masonry. In the 1820s alone, the Vatican issued three official statements condemning the order.
 The position of the Catholic Church, the government's suspicions of Free­ masom-v, the obvious association between Freemasonry and Orangeism in mJ.nv lodges, and the disavowal of Catl10lic Ireland's cherished demagogue combined to compromise any appeal Freemasonry had to the Irish majority. An institution that had served in the late eighteenth century as a meeting ground for Protestants and Catholics had become, over four decades, an almost ex­ clusively Protestant domain. As Roy Foster explains, both Freemasonry and Orangeism became "part of the social cement of Protestantism in the new era."48
 Patriots, who identified with and fought for an abstraction (like a constitution or a nation), were found all along the political spectrum. In fact, many histo­ rians have taken pains to demonstrate that the label "patriot" was contested vigorously between the mid-eighteenth and the mid-nineteenth century, when people of various political affiliations, including radicals, could and did claim to be "patriots."51 Whereas patriotism was up for grabs, loyalism had a much more specific meaning, though it too could shift over time. Loyalists, who identified with a particular ruler, government, or party, were generally conservative sup­ porters of the establishment and upholders of the existing political svstem.
 With its well-established colonies and new territories, the British Empire was also comprised of populations of greater diversity than any previous empire.

Its very public presence had long received the sanction of colonial governors, who appreciated the usefulness of Masonic venues and beneficial effect of Masonic ceremonies on the societies in their charge.

 Political reform at the highest level was carried out in the context of tremendous public debate about imperial questions. As Catherine Hall has shown, the years leading up to the passage of the Great Reform Act, which did away with ‘‘rotten’’ boroughs and expanded the electorate by approx- imately 60 percent across the United Kingdom in 1832, were preceded by elaborate discussions of citizenship in a variety of ‘‘colonial’’ contexts.≥ Ireland was one. Although Britons did not typically use the word ‘‘colony’’ for Ireland at the time, in Hall’s view it was a colony ‘‘in that Irish Catholics in Ireland were treated as a conquered people and English Protestants in Ireland acted as colonial settlers.’’∂ Religious di√erence carried with it overtones of racial di√erence, and Irish Catholics were politically disen- franchised as well as culturally subordinated. Daniel O’Connell’s work with the Catholic Association, and especially his speeches to Parliament, placed civil rights for the Catholic Irish at the heart of political debate and made it clear that the peace and stability of the whole of the United Kingdom was in peril if political emancipation at the periphery closest in was not forthcoming. Unrest in Upper and Lower Canada in this period added to the sense that the empire was in crisis.∑ Jamaica was another very visible colonial context in which debates about political reform occurred in the 1830s. Parliament was preoccupied with events in Jamaica in the two years leading up to the passage of the Reform Act of 1832, especially in the wake of the Christmas rebellion in December 1831, in which free black men and women sought to overthrow slavery and were brutally repressed.∏ As in Ireland, the language of civil rights and the threat to private property in Jamaica set the stage for a quite conservative Reform Bill in 1832, one that en- franchised about 400,000 men in the United Kingdom but that left the ma- jority of British men and all British women without the parliamentary vote.
 But on top of these marginalized and exploited native populations, many British settlers overseas sought to create a full-scale replica of the elaborately graded social hierarchy they had left behind at home. From this perspective, empire was about the replication of rank, not the rejection of it. Accordingly, in the thirteen American colonies, by the mid eighteenth century, the countryside seemed increasingly settled and ordered on the English pattern, with great estates, elegant mansions, resident gentry, and all the accoutrements of traditional society: fox hunts, coats of arms, swords and periwigs. Titles such as Esquire, Gent, Master and Honourable were used to show who was who; church pews were assigned on the basis of social position; and there were even requests to establish a colonial peerage. In such a layered, aspiring, established society, it was generally believed that everyone had ‘their appointed offices, places and station’; that ‘God hath ordained different degrees and orders of men’; and that there was ‘a beauty of order in society, as when the different members… have all their appointed offices, place and situation’. Thus regarded, colonial America was indeed a very hierarchical society, a title-conscious place, with a prestige order that corresponded roughly with economic rank order. Hence, for those opposed to British government, the need to abolish titles in America after the revolution of 1776.9
 These developments in Ireland, towards proconsular splendour as a reassertion of hierarchy, were also being paralleled and replicated in Canada. As it happened, French society in Quebec was pre-1789 in its seigneurial structure and veneration for monarchy, and in this regard it had much in common with the British society being established in neighbouring Ontario, where most of the immigrants were conservative refugees fleeing from the thirteen colonies, and eager to proclaim their continuing loyalty to Britain's throne and rigid social order. Moreover, in 1791 the younger Pitt planned to provide an hereditary upper house in anxious but determined response to the mistaken egalitarianism of the French (and American) Revolutions. By all these means, the principal aim was ‘to avoid a replica of democratic New England’, and to inculcate ‘a due deference and homage for superiors’ and a degree of ‘subordination necessary to civilized society’.11 And during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the full panoply of proconsular aggrandizement and mimetic monarchy was unfurled, with elaborate pageantry and ceremonial, orchestrated by such patrician governors as Lord Dorchester in Quebec, Lord Dalhousie in Canada and John Wentworth in Nova Scotia (and also, half a world away, by Lord Charles Somerset at the recently acquired Cape of Good Hope).12 Here were precedents aplenty for later imperial developments in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
 Underpinning all these mid-century settler regimes, with their traditional, transoceanic loyalties and their ‘imported social hierarchies’, was the view, originally pioneered by some American colonists and carried over into the nineteenth century by many people in Britain and the empire, that a mature settler society was necessarily a graded, layered society. That, in essence, was what they were seeking to establish in these new, far-distant realms: in part by the export of authentic British aristocrats overseas, who would set the social tone and the social standard; in part by the emulative creation of their own indigenous landed gentry. This was why Edward Gibbon Wakefield urged the transplanting of a complete cross-section of British society in his Letter from Sydney (1829), and again in A View of the Art of Colonization (1849). This was why the Hon. Arthur Hamilton Gordon, himself a younger son of Lord Aberdeen, urged that ‘If a good number of younger sons who vegetate in England were to go out there [i.e. Canada] it might be useful as forming a sort of aristocracy which is so much wanted there.’11 And that was why, in his novel The Caxtons (1849), Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton expressed the hope that an aristocracy would develop in Australia. Far from wishing to reject the stratified society of the mother country, these pundits and politicians strenuously recommended its replication in the colonies.
 Their social hopes and hierarchical predictions were in significant measure fulfilled. Some emigrants, leaving Britain, wanted to re-establish the domestic social hierarchy they regretted they were leaving behind, and set out to improve their own place within it (vide Dickens's Mr Micawber); others, on arrival, wanted to distance themselves from those fellow travellers whom they considered, in every sense, beneath them. Hence the verdict of Sir Henry Huntley, governor of Prince Edward Island, who claimed that ‘an aristocratic instinct’ prevailed among the people of all the provinces of Canada. Hence these words of Sir Roger Therry, who in the 1860s noted that ‘the various observances of precedence in New South Wales, as in most colonial societies, are attended to with great, sometimes ludicrous, precision’. ‘Social distinction is everywhere desired,’ agreed the Sydney Morning Herald. All these colonial settlers – determined to replicate what they believed to be the British social order – shared what Geoffrey Bolton has called ‘an Anglican and hierarchical view of society’, which in its ideal form was ‘one of village communities, in which an obedient and industrious tenantry enjoyed the public libraries and mechanics institutes, the ploughing matches and hospitable sporting events, organized and controlled by the landed gentry’.12
 This ‘aristocratic thread’, which ran through Britain's new settler colonies, also meant a widespread eagerness for honours and hereditary distinctions: the coping stone, as Burke had long ago remarked, of any established, hierarchical society. In 1853 William Charles Wentworth proposed hereditary, titled legislative councillors in New South Wales, based on the Canadian model of 1791, and following a similar scheme put forward in South Australia four years previously. They ‘would lay the foundations of an aristocracy’ in the colony by encouraging and rewarding the leading local notables and would ‘necessarily form one of the strongest inducements’ to British aristocrats to send their relatives overseas.13 There were also many who shared the view of Sir Charles Fitzroy that colonial orders of knighthood would ‘strengthen their connections with the mother country, by holding up legitimate objects of ambition to public officers and resident gentry’. As colonial secretary, Lord Bathurst had considered the creation of a separate Order for Canada in the 1820s, and his successor, Lord Stanley, took up the idea again in 1844. At the time of Confederation, Lord Monck, then governor-general, urged the giving of titles for life to members of the new upper house and the creation of an Order of St Lawrence; and in 1881 Lord Lorne once more suggested the establishment of a Canadian order to the colonial secretary. In short, during the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the idea that ‘the aristocratic element should form a wide ingredient’ in colonial government and society was broadly held.14
 Here was a classic (and by now familiar) instance of visualizing the empire by analogy to the social structure as it had once existed in Britain. Nor should this continuing cult of connection and equivalence come as any surprise. For between 1919 and 1948 the person primarily responsible for recruitment to the British Colonial Service was Sir Ralph Furse, whose vision of British society, both domestic and imperial, was unashamedly rural, hierarchical and nostalgic. He was the scion of a county family in Devon; country life, country virtues and country people were his ‘ultimate realities’; he possessed ‘an unswervingly aristocratic bias in social and political arrangements’; and he saw colonial administration abroad as ‘a crusading service’, ‘forming the natural counterpart to the obligations of squires to tenants in England’.26 In selecting the young men who would go out and administer the empire, Furse did everything he could to ensure that they shared his vision. Ruling through ‘traditional’ authorities was how the English had always governed themselves; it was how they had come to govern Wales, Scotland and parts of Ireland; and now it was how they came to govern their overseas empire. As such, ‘Merrie Africa’ reflected, matched – and even in some ways surpassed – ‘Merrie England’.27
 Thus reinvented, and appropriately based at the Colonial Office, and with its chapel in St Paul's Cathedral, the Order of St Michael and St George gave the British proconsular elite a degree of prestige and social recognition far beyond anything that could be obtained in the German or French Colonial Services. In an empire constructed and conceived on strict hierarchical principles, such rewards and ranking were considered essential, and as the representative of the crown, a governor or governor-general had to be equipped with a ribbon and star and title. Among proconsuls we have already met, Arthur Hamilton Gordon was made a KCMG when he became governor of Mauritius in 1871, and seven years later, shortly after he had been translated to Fiji, he was promoted to the GCMG at the relatively tender age of fifty. In the next generation Frank Swettenham rose through the order as he ascended the Malayan Civil Service: the CMG in 1886 for his work as acting resident in Perak, the KCMG in 1897 as resident-general to the Federated Malay States, and the GCMG in 1909 in his retirement, and on his appointment as chairman of a royal commission to report on the finances of Mauritius. Later still, Hugh Clifford was made CMG in 1900 on taking up the post of governor of North Borneo, KCMG in 1909 while colonial secretary in Ceylon, and GCMG in 1921 as governor of Nigeria.6
 to establish themselves as ‘somebody’, as indigenous gentry, a status and a position to which they might never realistically have aspired at home. Small wonder, then, that many people who went out to the empire, as settlers or as administrators, or as proconsuls, sought to replicate Britain's social hierarchy overseas, on account of their enhanced position within it, rather than to overturn it.25
 10  Limitations This was a persuasive (and pervasive) picture of Britain and its empire, which needs to be recognized and retrieved. But it was also a partial (and partisan) picture, and that too needs to be recognized and retrieved. For in the attempt to create, unify and envision the British Empire as ‘one vast interconnected world’, which replicated and reinforced the domestic social order, there was – as in most fields of metropolitan control and peripheral collaboration, and as there had already been during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries – a significant gulf between theory and practice, intention and accomplishment.1 In reality, the empire was never as fully hierarchical or as convincingly homogenized as those Britons who governed it, collaborated in it and went along with it tried to make it, wished it to be or believed it to be. This in turn meant that in the imperial metropolis, there was always a view on the left (from Paine and Cobden to Morell and beyond) that the empire was a ‘Tory racket’: not so much an ordered, paternal, traditional organism, encompassing all levels of society, but a system of outdoor relief and exploitation for those at the top – the titled and the rich. These domestic critics tended to be urban, middle class and intellectual and, as the empire expanded and evolved, they were joined by colonials on the periphery, who tended to be from similar backgrounds and hold similar views.2 Even in the great dominions of settlement, and notwithstanding the best efforts of those who wished it otherwise, the British social hierarchy was neither fully nor successfully replicated. In nations with less developed and largely agricultural economies, the extremes of wealth and poverty were not as great as in Britain, which meant that society was less unequal and less layered. As Walter Bagehot explained, the ‘whole series of attempts to transplant to the colonies a graduated English society’ had ‘always failed at the first step’, with ‘the base of the pyramid spread abroad and the apex tumbled in and perished’.3 Indeed, for many settlers, the entire point of emigrating was to get away from what they perceived as the suffocating hierarchy (and hierarchical attitudes) of the mother country, and to begin a new life where equality and opportunity were more important, as this had also been true in an earlier century of their colonial American forebears. From such a perspective, the lack of hierarchy in the colonies – known in Australia as ‘mateship’ – was a measure of success, not failure.4 ‘The overseas British,’ John Darwin notes, ‘generally had little sympathy for what they regarded as an over-rigid class system at home.’ And when the overseas British were Irish, who were Catholic rather than Anglican, and Home Rulers rather than imperialists, they were even less likely to accept the imperial hierarchy, preferring (as in parts of Australia) to apply their domestic grievances to colonial agitation.5 Hence too the real opposition among many in the settlement dominions to those failed and faded sprigs of immigrant nobility: those ‘gentlemen emigrants’ and aristocratic ‘remittance men’, trying to live in absurdly extravagant and lordly and leisured style in the meritocratic colonies, on the basis of a regular but limited income from home, and who gave themselves airs and graces that impressed none and enraged many. They too were signs and symbols of the world that most settlers had thankfully left behind, and of which they did not wish to be reminded. Hence too the disapproval of the excessively expensive proconsular paraphernalia of Government House, with its petty snobberies, its ‘sham’ courts, its obsession with precedence, and all the toadying and title-hunting sycophants who sought invitations to go there.6 Hence, finally, the criticism of the office of the governor-general itself as being no more than ‘a glittering and gaudy toy’, and of those who held it as the ‘party dumpings of Britain’, the ‘imported pooh-bahs’, the ‘untried juvenile noblemen’ and the ‘aristocratic fain-ants’ with whom the dominions were all too often fobbed off as governors-general, such as Buxton in South Africa, Bessborough in Canada, Bledisloe in New Zealand and Dudley in Australia.7

 Oonagh Walsh, in her study of the Irish abroad, has argued that, with  the welcome easing of the theoretical frameworks in regard to migra- tion, scholars have been able to be more imaginative when including  ‘career’ migrants such as missionaries, the professional classes, soldiers,  and policemen into the migrant pool.103 The need for a wider apprecia- tion of groups or categories who may not have thought of themselves  as immigrants, therefore, demands a more in-depth investigation. This  would include itinerant workers of all kinds – transported felons, musi- cians, thespians, domestic servants, merchant seamen, indentured  labourers, customs officials and railway engineers – transnationalism  or globalisation from below.104 Hilary Carey’s chapter surveys one of  the more neglected of these careers, the clergy. Although Catholic  Australia’s dependence on Irish émigré clergy is well known, what is  less familiar is that all the major denominations were intensely reliant  on British-born clerics until well into the twentieth century. Using as  her focus one of the most vital, but little understood British colonial  institutions – that of the emigrant churches – she argues that the clergy  played a pivotal role in the importation and diffusion of a sense of  British identity (and morality) to Australian churchgoers. By exploring  one of the more complex cultural connections between Britain and the  settler colonies in Australia, Carey sets out a new and exciting agenda  for migration historians to develop. Building on the work of Howard  Malchow,105 she provides additional insights into how the church  played an important role in the emigration process itself. Providing  spiritual solace to emigrants was only one small, but important role  performed by the clergy. By the mid-nineteenth century, they not only  took an active role on Boards of Guardians, Poor Law committees and  emigration societies – writing letters of recommendation for would-be  migrants106 – but they themselves became part of the migratory process  to meet the pastoral demands of burgeoning colonial flocks throughout  the southern British World.

In the Canadian context, the  church played a key role in maintaining long-term stability of immigrant rural  communities, which has not been explored by historians for the Anglo-Celtic  communities, but has been explored in depth for the non-Anglo-Saxons such as  Mennonites, Doukhobors, Jews, Mormons and Ukrainians. See J. C. Lehr and  Y. Katz, ‘Crown, Corporation and Church: the Role of Institutions in the Stability  of Pioneer Settlements in the Canadian West, 1870–1914’, Journal of Historical  Geography, 21:4 (1995), pp. 413–29.
 The plan here is to take a rather different approach to this question,  focusing on one of the most important (but generally underestimated)  of all British colonial institutions, namely the emigrant churches.  Although the story of the dependence of Australian Catholics on  Irish émigré clergy has been well studied, to the extent that the con- tribution of other ethnic groups to the Catholic community and of  the large number of Irish who contributed to Australia’s Protestant  churches tends to be overlooked,2 it is less well known that all the  major churches were heavily dependent on British-born clergy until  well into the twentieth century. This chapter provides an analysis of [ 83 ] some of the consequences of this patterning of ethnicity, profession and  religion, which would appear to be unmatched by few other professions  or migrant groups who came to the Australian colonies.3 It is argued  that clergy were one of the key components in the transmission of a  sense of British identity to churchgoing Australians, and that their  role makes explicable the surge of empire-mindedness at the time of  the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901. Yet, as with other  cultural institutions, the influence of religion did not act entirely in  one direction from metropole to colony but rather, as Catherine Hall  has emphasised, drawing on the work of Frantz Fanon, colonial subjects  and objects were ‘mutually constituted’ and to some extent create each  other.4 To what extent was religion used to reinforce the loyalty of  colonists in the way that Hamish Ion has argued was axiomatic for the  British defence forces?5
 To address these questions, this chapter is divided into four sec- tions: the first section gives an account of the historical background  to religious emigration from the British Isles and the responses of the  churches to the crisis of personnel created by mass migration; the  second section considers the role of colonial missionary societies in  promoting religion and imperial loyalty; the third looks at the charac- teristics of clerical migrants to the Australian colonies of New South  Wales (NSW) and Victoria as their numbers peaked in the 1880s and  1890s; the final section looks at the development of colonial religious  nationalism, typically ardently patriotic to Britain, as this is reflected  in church periodicals in the colonies.
 Emigration and the churches Until the middle decades of the nineteenth century, it was felt that  there was little urgency in providing for the religious needs of British  overseas colonies. In the course of the colonisation of North America,  dissenting colonists provided for themselves in scornful defiance of  the established church while Anglicans made do with chaplains sup- plied by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG).6 The  deficiencies of this system are one factor in the relative decline of  Episcopalianism in North America, in contrast to the vigorous growth  of other Protestant churches such as Baptists, Wesleyan Methodists  and Independents or Congregationalists. American colonists were  profoundly suspicious of religious overtures from Britain which were  associated with the advance of establishment religion at the expense  of colonial liberties. Officially supplied colonial clergy in both British  North America and the West Indies were sometimes derided as lazy and  second rate and too closely identified with settler interests on issues [ 84 ] such as slavery, and other issues which reflected the economic self- interest of the expatriate communities. Nor was there any more official  enthusiasm to provide new colonies with religious establishments. In  the late eighteenth century, it required the intervention of William  Wilberforce with Prime Minister William Pitt to ensure that a chaplain  was provided to sail with the convict colonists bound for Botany Bay.7  In response to local requests Catholic and Presbyterian chaplains were  regularly supplied to troops stationed in India and elsewhere as a con- tribution to military discipline, but there was no urgency about this.  While semi-official sources such as the SPG continued to advocate the  cause of religious colonisation,8 such views were not nourished with  the funds which would allow the planting of any but the most basic of  chaplaincy services.
 It was not until the 1820s that these official attitudes begin to  change. They did so partly as a result of religious reform in Britain and  partly as a response to colonial conditions. Catholic emancipation in  1829 was followed by the arrival of Catholic bishops in British territory  that had previously been off limits to them both at home and in the col- onies.9 Even before this, where Britain had acquired colonies in which  the Catholic powers of Spain, France, and Portugal had already planted  Catholic dioceses there were ready-made populations of Catholics who  became British subjects and who asserted the right to practise their reli- gion. In the case of the former French colony of Canada, now the British  province of Quebec, such rights were guaranteed by the terms of the  Treaty of Paris (1763). Elsewhere the practical necessity of extending  religious toleration to the mixed communities of overseas Britons, in  which the adherents of the established churches of England, Scotland  and Ireland were challenged by the number of Catholics and dissenters,  forced the hand of reform.
 One of the earliest experiments in religious toleration was con- ducted in New South Wales by the Church Act (1836), which was  introduced by Governor Richard Bourke (1777–1855) to encourage the  building of churches and the maintenance of ministers of religion.10  This effectively removed the special privileges of the Church of  England and provided funding ‘for the advancement of the Christian  Religion [and] the promotion of good morals in New South Wales’  regardless of denominational adherence. Initially support was claimed  by the Anglicans, Catholics and Presbyterians; later other denomina- tions benefited from the Act, including Baptists, Jews and Methodists.  In this way the colonies became the sites for both religious reform and  for sectarian competition to plant churches and attract settler devo- tion. Between 1842 and 1847, several years before the restoration of  the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales (1850–51), five Catholic [ 85 ] dioceses were erected in the Australian colonies. After the establish- ment of the Colonial Bishoprics Fund in 1842, the Church of England  also had the capacity to send out colonial bishops who had been so  conspicuously absent from the first British Empire.
 The other churches were just as active in planting churches, par- ticularly the Wesleyans whose missionary expansion occurs at the  same time as the expansion of the empire. Presbyterian interest in reli- gious colonisation was stimulated by the Disruption of the Church of  Scotland (1843), which led to a burst of colonial and missionary energy  by the Free Church of Scotland. Colonial reforms also created oppor- tunities for the churches overseas which were not matched by those at  home. In the same year as the Disruption, widespread resentment at  the economic injustice of the Canadian clergy reserves, whose revenues  had been directed exclusively to the support of the Church of England,  led to their abolition. While some shreds of the old establishment of the  national churches of the British Isles remained in evidence, to a large  extent the settler colonies were open to free religious colonisation by  the churches.
 This was the situation at the beginning of the ‘hungry 1840s’, which  were followed by a fever for emigration that affected all classes and  sectors of British society, not least the churches. In the aftermath  of the famine, Irish emigrants profoundly altered the character of  Catholicism in both England and Scotland.11 In relation to emigration  to the colonies, Edward Gibbon Wakefield’s advocacy of planned or  systematic colonisation, in which the moral character of the emigrant  communities was strongly emphasised, may also have played a role  in encouraging the churches to play a more active part in the emigra- tion process. While, initially, the churches were concerned only with  providing spiritual comforts to emigrants in transit, the scale of mass  emigration soon led to more ambitious plans. This took several forms.  First, at the home end, clergy were enlisted to form part of emigration  committees and societies devoted to the welfare of migrants. They  also played a significant role in writing recommendations and refer- ences for potential migrants who were being considered as possible  candidates for assisted migration to Australia, the destination with the  most carefully managed emigrant programme.12 Second, a number of  churches created emigration societies or emigrant chaplaincy services  with a special mission to assist emigrants either in transit or while they  were making the adjustment to life in a new country. There has been  more interest in the activities of clergy ministering to Irish Catholic  emigrants to the United States than to those of other faiths,13 but all the  churches were active in this work and the United States was simply one  destination for British migrants during these decades.14 Irish emigrant [ 86 ] chaplains have also been studied in relation to the Irish emigrant com- munities in Britain in more recent times.15 Third, some home churches  undertook to supply clergy directly in response to requests and funding  from colonial churches. For the Irish Catholic diaspora, Sheridan Gilley  has illuminated this question more thoroughly than anyone else.16  Suellen Hoy has considered the emigration of Irish religious women to  the United States in the great growth era of the US churches.17 There  have been more limited studies of the colonial schemes of the Church  of Scotland.18 But overall it must be admitted that there are many gaps  in our knowledge of emigrating clergy and the impact they may have  had on the communities they came to serve.
 The official chaplains and some higher clergy were part of the  colonial establishment; they had their passages paid by the govern- ment and their salaries and positions were included in the Colonial  Office List. Their power and salaries could be substantial. In the West  Indies in 1867, the Bishop of Barbados, Thomas Parry earned £2,500  with a seat on the Executive Council and a rank and salary second  only to the Governor; Anglican rectors earned £320 and even curates  collected £200 as well as being provided with a residence.19 However,  most clergy were not government officials and they made their way  out to the colonies either under their own steam or with the financial  assistance of their churches. The financial support provided by the  SPG to the Church of England began to be withdrawn as soon as the  churches became more independent. In New South Wales, the Bishop  of Australia, W. G. Broughton, tried hard to get the Colonial Office to  continue paying the passage money for SPG chaplains, but by March  1847 the colonial secretary, Earl Grey, was advising that he was only  prepared to do this on the direct instruction of the Governor.20 This  reluctance was understandable when the ‘passage allowance’ was as  high as £150 – a year’s salary for a curate. Besides, the number of clergy  in the colony was rapidly increasing. From this time, most clergy who  arrived in Australia were sponsored by the churches; but a good number  were likely to have made their own way, ignoring the common advice  that there were no opportunities there for the gentleman emigrant.
 It was also possible for a clergyman to work his way to the colonies.  In the 1850s the Colonial Land and Emigration Commission (CLEC)  allocated free passage for clergy willing to travel on emigrant ships and  provide religious instruction on the voyage to groups of migrants. In  general, there were always more clergy seeking to take advantage of  these provisions than there were places available. After 1858, a stream  of correspondence between the CLEC and the colonial seminary of All  Hallows College, Drumcondra, secured passage in this way for some  newly ordained Catholic priests on their way to Australian dioceses.21
 [ 87 ] Another important route to the colonies was provided for a limited  number of the Protestant churches as a result of the work of colonial  missionary societies, organisations established by most of the churches  specifically to supply subsidies for clergy, schoolteachers, churches  and other support for the colonial churches. These provided the most  sophisticated response to the problem of clergy emigration, which is  considered in the next section.
 Colonial missionary societies Colonial missionary societies were not an innovation of the nine- teenth century but had existed in some form since the foundation of  the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge (SPCK) in 1698,  and the SPG in 1701. Under its charter, the three objects of the SPG  were: first, to provide a sufficient maintenance for an orthodox clergy  to live among British colonists; second, to make other provision for  the propagation of the Gospel; and finally, to receive, manage, and  dispose of the charity of His Majesty’s subjects for those purposes.22 A  subsidiary object was the proselytisation of the indigenous Americans.  At the end of the eighteenth century a second wave of missionary  enthusiasm led to the formation of missionary societies, including  the Baptist Missionary Society (1792), the London Missionary Society  (1795), and the Society for Missions to Africa and the East, later the  Church Missionary Society (1799). Unlike the SPG or the SPCK, these  new societies were focused on foreign rather than colonial missions,  though both the Baptist and Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Societies  continued the older tradition of sending out missionaries to Christian  colonists.
 Colonial missions were revived as a religious object in the 1820s and  at first they were largely the work of pious laypeople serving the needs  of particular colonies. The Glasgow Colonial Society (1825) funded  the training and supply of ministers from the Church of Scotland for  Canada;23 the Newfoundland School Society (1823) provided evangeli- cal schoolteachers for the bleak and outer reaches of this colony which  was threatened by its large Catholic population.24 Others had more  general objects, including the Colonial Missionary Society (1838),  which provided support to Congregational churches in British colonies  and ports throughout the empire from Canada to Shanghai.25 Although  the overall efforts of the colonial missionary societies were on a smaller  scale than the societies which focused on foreign missions, they still  represent a significant investment by the home churches in the settler  colonies. By the end of the nineteenth century, when most were scaling  down their operations in tune with the flow of emigrants, there were [ 88 ] at least fifteen colonial missionary societies providing for emigrant  and settler needs in this way.26 Although the SPG had the benefit of  annual grants from Parliament to support its work in North America  (discontinued in 1834), all the colonial missionary societies were  obliged to seek funds from members of their own churches to support  their work; their annual sermons, missionary journals and reports  provided a stream of propaganda promoting the religious objects of   empire.
 In relation to Australia, these points might be illustrated from  the early activity of the Colonial Church Society (CCS), an Anglican  society which was formed in 1835 to supply evangelical clergy to  British colonists.27 In 1851 the CCS merged with the Australian Church  Missionary Society and the Newfoundland School Society to form the  Colonial Church and School Society and eventually the Colonial and  Continental Church Society (CCCS). Although its original activities  were modest in scope, by the middle of the century the CCCS had  secured royal patronage and the support of the majority of the home and  colonial bishops of the Church of England. Emboldened by this support,  it then launched a worldwide operation to provide for the needs of  British colonists, as well as support for travellers and sojourners in  Europe.28 In the 1830s, the Anglican CCS had been equally ambitious:  it would be for Christian colonists what the Church Missionary Society  was for the heathen in Africa and the East, becoming the evangelical  equivalent of the SPG.29 Indeed, the first report made scathing reference  to the fact that the work of evangelising the heathen was going on apace  while the colonists of Great Britain were being neglected: ‘connected  with us by the closest ties, and retaining, wherever they settle, English  opinions, habits and affections . . . more than any Heathen community  . . . they claim our friendly aid’.30
 The report went on to outline the dimensions of the problem: the  British people had spread throughout the world, but their clergy had  been unable to accompany them. In Newfoundland, there was a white  population virtually without clergy. At the Cape of Good Hope, for  60,000 whites, many English, it was alleged that there were no more  than two or three churches with two or three English clergymen. In  the colony of New South Wales, eight small churches were available to  serve a population of 80,000 persons.31 The grim statistics – which are  in fact wildly inaccurate – were presented in tabular form (table 3.1): The challenge of persuading supporters of the urgency of the need  to support colonial missions in the face of other competing causes  was, nevertheless, met in various ways. One of the most important  was the preaching of an annual sermon at which a collection would  be taken up in aid of the cause and was later published in the CCCS’s T ab le  3
 [ 90 ] journal.32 Besides providing an opportunity for such a collection, these  annual sermons were also used to articulate links between religion  and empire, and the key place of the colonial mission in advancing  the providential purpose of Christian colonisation. For the Anglican  evangelicals who supported the work of the Colonial Church Society  and its successors, the planting of the Protestant faith was bound  inextricably to the advancement of British culture. In his annual  sermon for the Society, Rev. Edward Bickersteth (1786–1850) argued  that the empire was part of a divine plan for Britain: ‘God favoured  our beloved country by rescuing us from Pagan and Papal darkness,  giving us a truly scriptural Church. . . . Thus it may be transplanted to  every one of our Colonies, with all its treasure of truth and devotion.  What an empire spread over the world has God thus entrusted to Great   Britain’.33
 Somewhat muted, though similar, arguments were presented by the  SPG when responding to the call to minister to the expanding British  population overseas.34 Sectarianism was also used as a weapon to secure  funding by both Protestant and Catholic clergy. Broughton’s urgency  is easily matched from the correspondence of the first Catholic Bishop  of Australia, the English Benedictine, John Bede Polding (1794–1877).  In 1835, when he arrived in Sydney, there were only four priests to  greet him. Against his own better judgement, he felt driven to ordain  his own accompanying clerks in order to provide some relief. At this  time there were over 100,000 people in New South Wales and annual  musters show that 28 per cent of them were Catholic. It seemed like a  golden opportunity: ‘We only want priests’, Polding wrote in 1836, ‘to  make this country Catholic.’ Four years later he was still begging for  clergy from his agent, Father Heptonstall, in Dublin: ‘Clergy, clergy,  clergy, in the name of God I do ask and entreat you to send me.’35 Over  the next few decades he may have had cause to reject the answering  of his prayers as Irish clergy flowed in a steady stream to Australian  dioceses to answer the call and few Australian candidates presented  themselves as candidates for the priesthood. In the 1880s, Cardinal  Moran attempted to establish a national seminary in the seaside  Sydney suburb of Manly, but its early intake was disappointingly   small.36
 The difficulties faced by the Catholic hierarchy in New South Wales  were not unique: all the colonial churches were starved of personnel  and the colonial missionary societies, including the SPG, the CCCS,  and the Colonial Church Society, were only ever able to make a partial  response to the need. But how many clergy came? And what impact  did they have?
 Although more work has been done on the migration of the Irish  Catholic clergy than the clergy of other denominations, Catholics  were not alone in preferring clergy who spoke with the accents of their  home churches. Malcolm Prentis has demonstrated the very high levels  of Scottish and Irish recruitment to the Presbyterian ministry, which  continued well beyond the period of colonial dependence. Scottish  ministers were sought from Ulster and Edinburgh as much for reasons  of prestige as out of necessity.50 In Victoria, the colony with the strong- est Presbyterian community, 65 per cent of the ministry came from  Scotland, 13.5 per cent from Ireland, another 8 per cent from England  and Wales, and only 10 per cent were Australian-born. Although the  strongest period of recruitment was from 1850 to 1880, by 1900, 90  per cent of candidates for the Presbyterian ministry were still born  overseas.
 Surprisingly, in 1900 the Anglican clergy were rather more likely  to have been born in Australia than either the Catholics or the  Presbyterians, though still less than the general population. This is prob- ably due to the impact of the Moore Theological College at Liverpool,  founded in 1856, as a theological training college for the Anglican min- istry. In 1906, half the rectors in the diocese of Sydney had been trained  at Moore College.51 Education and experience in the United Kingdom  still mattered, however. If we take representative samples from the  synod reports of two Anglican dioceses in New South Wales, of the 141  clergy licensed in the Sydney diocese, the largest number, fifty-one (36  per cent), had attended universities or theological colleges in the UK, [ 94 ] while forty-nine were graduates of Moore College, and nineteen were  graduates of the University of Sydney. About a quarter of the Sydney  clergy had also had parochial experience in the UK.52
 The Anglican diocese of Newcastle shows a similar pattern. In  1900–01, there were forty-six clergy licensed in the diocese. Of these,  eighteen (39 per cent) were university graduates of whom fifteen, or  about a third of the total, had degrees from universities in the UK;  six Newcastle clergy had parochial experience in England and four  were ordained by English bishops. Across the Australian colonies this  pattern is likely to be much the same, though rural dioceses were more  likely to be forced to recruit directly from home and retained their  English accent for longer.53 In dioceses where a particular preference  was for English clergy, however, the proportion might be nearly 100 per  cent. In the diocese of Brisbane, for example, Bishop W. T. T. Webber  dismissed clergy he regarded as inefficient and staffed exclusively from  home, securing young men for five-year terms.54 By the turn of the  century this had begun to seem retrograde.
 There is rather more accessible information about the Catholic  clergy, which consisted of both ordained priests as well as members  of some religious orders who did not take holy orders, than for other  groups. The Catholic priesthood in Australia in the period from first  settlement in 1788 until 31 December 1900 was analysed by T. J.  Linane, parish priest of Bungaree in Victoria and editor of the magazine  Footprints.55 Linane’s sources included Catholic directories, with evi- dence of date of death taken from cemeteries, and necrology lists kept  by superiors of religious orders. He calculated that during the period  studied there were 1,800 priests who made some or all of their lives in  Australia. Of these, 1,300 submitted death duties. Unlike the Anglican  clergy, Catholic priests were unlikely to ever return to their country  and diocese of origin to retire because no funds were ever provided  for this purpose. While some had international careers, most came  to Australia directly from their seminaries of training and pursued  their calling there. In terms of their national origins, in Australia, the  dependence of the Catholic Church on foreign-born clergy in the nine- teenth century is self-evident, amounting to 95.5 per cent of the total.  Of those whose nationality is known, 1,282 or 79 per cent were from  Ireland. In rank order, the French and Australian-born come a distant  second and third with eighty-nine each or 5.5 per cent; the English- born, Italians and Austrians all manage to secure more than one per  cent of the total. All other nationalities, sixteen in all, contribute 3.5  per cent to the total (see table 3.2).
 At nearly 80 per cent of the total, it is important to stress the  importance of Ireland as a source for priests to Australian colonies [ 95 ] before 1900. However, it is worth noting that priests from other  parts of Europe were significant as members of the religious orders,  the majority of whom worked as teachers in Catholic schools. Of  the 1,750 priests counted by Linane, 505 came from one of eighteen  religious orders of which the Jesuits, Benedictines and Marists led the  way. All of these orders ran high schools in which Australian students  might come into close association with Austrian Jesuits, English  Benedictines or French Marist Fathers. However, these were islands of  European Catholicity in an Irish Sea. For county of origin, Linane has  secure information for only 515 of the 1,282 Irish in the cohort. Kerry,  Limerick, Cork, Kilkenny and Tipperary account for more than 50 per  cent of the total. However, the single most significant agent in the  formation of Catholic colonial clergy in Australia was the missionary Table 3.2 National origins of Catholic priests in Australia, 1788–1900
 Before the foundation of All Hallows in 1842, other seminaries  which contributed to the Australian mission fields included Maynooth,  Waterford, Carlow, Thurles, and St Laurence O’Toole’s in Dublin. Of  these, Maynooth and Carlow were probably the most important. Two  other bodies of Catholic clergy should also be considered here. The  teaching orders, of which the Marist Brothers, founded by Marcellin  Champagnat (1789–1840) in France in 1817, and the Irish Christian  Brothers were the largest, were also a very important presence in  Australia. Like the priesthood, they were initially dominated by the  Irish-born with peaks for new arrivals occurring in the 1880s, and  again in the 1890s, when the main national education acts removed  state support for Catholic education, and Irish clerical teachers were  despatched to fill the need.57 After this date, Fogarty notes, most reli- gious orders were able to recruit from their own daughter communities  established in Australia, estimating that in 1880 more than half of all  members of religious orders in Australia would have been Irish-born.58  The third group of clerical personnel were religious women or nuns  whose trajectory of arrivals follows that of the male religious orders.  Women in religious orders in Australia included trained teachers,  nurses and a much smaller number who chose a life of prayer and strict  enclosure. They were also sourced from Ireland, France, and England  to teach the schools established by orders such as the Sisters of Mercy,  and the hospitals of the Sisters of Charity.59 But even the Australian  Sisters of St Joseph found it useful to maintain a house for new recruits  in Ireland.60
 Overall, despite the limitations of the evidence, it can be concluded  that the ethnicity of the clergy of all the major denominations followed  the pattern we can observe for Presbyterians and Catholics in that  they were more likely to be born in England, Scotland or Ireland than  might be expected for the colonial population of New South Wales and  Victoria as a whole. Although it has generally been assumed that the  Catholic clergy were dominated by emigrants from Ireland, it needs to  be stressed that the Anglican and Presbyterian clergy, where figures  are available, were just as dependent on emigrants. And though Ireland  was a significant source of Catholic clergy who made emigrant journeys  to Australia, the cohort was quite diverse and included significant  numbers of French, English, Italian and other European nationalities  as well. Just what impact this heavy dependence on first-generation  emigrants had on religious communities is difficult to determine, but  is the topic of the next section.
 [ 97 ] Importing morality and culture The attempts to recruit clergy for Australian churches was based on  the assumption that churches provided a significant contribution to  morality and culture in the colonies – societies in which these valuable  commodities were in short supply. Especially in the former convict  colonies, statistics which seemed to indicate the improvement of the  moral tone of the colony were carefully delineated. The Victorian  census of 1881 prepared by the French statistician Henry Heylyn,  gives some insight into the number and variety of people who made a  livelihood, by one means or another, by ministering to religion in the  Australian colonies.61 By Heylyn’s reckoning, this comprised a large  and varied group, including at its most humble levels gravediggers and  lay preachers, and extending to the most senior clergy. While the most  numerous single group within this class was the 195–strong clergymen  of the Church of England, the next largest was made up of the 155  women who registered themselves as nuns or sisters of charity. Many  of these women were working as nurses and teachers; some would have  considered themselves primarily as ministering to religion. Even if we  exclude these religious women from our calculations, the Victorian  census indicates that the clerical profession formed a visible and  significant group in Victorian society, as in other colonies. However,  in 1881 they were vastly outnumbered, by a factor of 5.5:1, by the  teachers; they were also outnumbered by the medical practitioners and  druggists, and the lawyers. It is obviously important, therefore, that we  avoid making too many assumptions about the impact of the clergy on  the wider Victorian society.
 [ 99 ] Australasian colonies (table 3.4). It shows the clear advantage that the  colony of Victoria enjoyed in terms of the number of its clergy across  the different colonies.
 This indicates that by 1861, the proportion of the clergy to the popu- lation was already as high as it was in England and Wales (where it was  about 0.1 per cent) and by 1871 it had actually exceeded it. Even though  the proportion of clergy did not match that of its cultivated southern  neighbour, the report on the NSW census of 1900 indicates that there  were 1,132 Christian clergy in New South Wales stretched across six  major denominations. Of these, the Congregationalists had the highest  proportion of clergy to adherents, while the Church of England, at 0.06  per cent, had the lowest. It was, of course, galling to majority Protestant  opinion to realise that the Roman Catholics had more clergy among  their ranks. A final table shows occupations according to ‘distinct call- ings’.63 This shows that the number of clergymen rose from 1871 to  1881 from 633 to 782. However, it is also significant that the number  of theological students remained very small in this period, rising in  number from six to twenty-two, indicating the continuing need to call  on the home country for supplies.
 Clergy and religious nationalism Leaving aside these thorny statistical questions, the overall pattern  is clear: the Australian clergy were distinctive as a predominately  British-born group peaking in the 1880s and 1890s, and this forms a  contrast with the pattern in other white settler societies, especially  the United States, where theological schools and seminaries were  established very early and were able to train a native-born ministry.  Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century, in all the Table 3.5 Occupations in Victoria, 1854–81
 [ 100 ] major Christian churches, Australians showed a great reluctance to  enter training for the ministry. While there were differences in the  overall pattern of ethnicity and clerical occupation, Methodists were  rather more likely to have native-born pastors, and Presbyterians  most likely to be ministered to by a native Scot or Irishman. For most  churchgoing Australians, religion was something administered to  you by especially imported English, Scottish, or Irish professionals.  A final question for this chapter is to consider the possible effect of  this ethnic conservatism in relation to colonial religious identity and  imperial and national identities. Did the clergy act to reinforce empire  values? Were they a kind of conservative break on the development  of a more independent Australian consciousness? Of course, there is  no necessary reason why clergy (or any other migrant) might be more  inclined, simply by reason of their original place of birth to be more  or less supportive of national movements in the Australian colonies.  But what kind of role did they play in maintaining conservative  traditions? As bearers of the home culture, clergy might at the very  least be seen to be agents in the ‘chains of memory’ that the French  sociologist Danièle Hervieu-Léger, has argued constitute the essential  bonds that bind religions to their societies and keep people going to   church.64
 Church periodicals, of which there are at least two or three for each  major denomination, are rich sources of commentary on clerical arriv- als and departures. While some were written and published indepen- dently of the churches whose readers they served, mostly they reflect  conservative opinion which is close to that of their churches’ leading  clerics. All churches shared the view that British (or, more precisely,  English, Scottish, Irish, or Welsh) was better, even when all efforts  to try and supply candidates for the ministry from local candidates  failed. In a letter to the SPG in 1847 Bishop Broughton reflected on  the difficulty of training colonial youths to the Anglican ministry. He  thought it would be better to bring out young men from ‘good English  schools’ so that there would be ‘a perpetual infusion of English feelings  upon church subjects’, which he believed colonial youths could never  supply.65 When the first Australian-trained bishop was made Bishop  of North Queensland, the Archbishop of Sydney defended himself  from the charge of disloyalty for his actions: ‘Does this consecration  of a colonially-ordained clergyman in Sydney intimate any desire  rashly to sever ourselves from the close connection with the Church  in the motherland’?66 It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there was  active resistance to the development of a colonial ministry by English  bishops until forced by absolute necessity to seek locally for candi- dates. This did not happen on a significant scale until the first half of [ 101 ] the twentieth century, when reformers such as the bishop of Brisbane,  St Clair Donaldson (1863–1935) established theological training col- leges for Australian-born candidates and appointed them in their own  dioceses.67 Until then, the ideal was to attempt a reconstruction of the  English parochial system in Australia and import clergy to staff them  if at all possible.
 If anything, the Methodists were even more eager to defend their  loyalty to the empire than the Church of England. At a speech to  the 1864 anniversary meeting of the Methodist Missionary Society,  the Rev. William Butters (1810–1887)68 asserted that the church in  Australia was benefiting from the services of men who had no connec- tion with England. However, this was done with a certain defensive- ness: ‘Our people are as loyal to English Methodism as the colonists  are generally loyal to the British throne.’ By the 1890s, The Methodist  in particular was an organ for what one might term hard-core imperi- alist propaganda. In a talk delivered in the Leichhardt Wesleyan Hall  in Melbourne in 1901 (reproduced by special request of the congrega- tion), Rev. F. C. Boyer provided a providentialist interpretation of the  establishment of the Australian Commonwealth and of its ‘national’  (i.e. British) expansion, the characteristic mode of Methodist histori- ography.69 Only the intervention of Providence, in Boyer’s view, had  secured Australia for the British rather than the Catholic Spanish or  Portuguese. It was a chance gale, blown by God, which drove Captain  James Cook onto the east coast and ensured that the great navigator  made his way to Australian shores: ‘We gratefully recognize the hand  of God, moreover, in the rapidly increasing strengths of the Protestant  nations of the world, and in the assignment to them of so large a  proportion of the world’s colonies.’70 The Melbourne Methodist was  always a reliable source for loyal addresses on the occasion of major  events such as coronations or the death of a monarch; there was  rapture at news of imperial honours conferred on colonial notables, and  rebukes to Republicans who questioned them. Coverage of the 100th  anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar, celebrated on 21 October 1905,  had to be carried over a dozen issues with emphasis on the role of the  ‘God of battles’ and His timely intervention on behalf of ‘our island  Empire and its Protestant Constitution and Throne’.71 The Rev. James  Carruthers (1848–1932), once described as the best editor the Methodist  ever had,72 tapped the same rich vein when he stated that Methodism  and imperialism were outgrowths of the same spirit: ‘We believe the  Empire as it stands today is in the line of Divine Providence, It is  the work of God.’73 Such sentiments reflected the loyalty, patriotism  and religious conviction of colonial Methodists throughout Greater   Britain.
 [ 102 ] By the end of the nineteenth century, colonial churches in Australia  were only at the beginning of the long process of becoming Australian,  which necessarily began with creating a native clergy. While it is at all  times difficult to trace the sources of national ideologies, the strength  of British imperial attachment among colonial churchgoers, as reflected  in their semi-official periodicals, could only have been reinforced by  the habit of importing clergy from the old country. By 1900 there were  beginning to be some concerns at the largely non-Australian make-up  of the clerical profession, but by and large it was the Britishness of  these clergy and their roots in the national or majority churches of  England, Scotland and Ireland, which made them attractive to both  their congregations and the appointment committees or bishops who  guaranteed their employment. Even if we must reject the geographi- cal idiosyncrasy which led Carruthers to speak of ‘our island Empire’,  perhaps it seemed so to the patriotic colonial Methodist. In a volume  which seeks to explore the networks which bound together the British  World, it therefore seems essential that we consider the key role played  by emigrating clergy in binding Australian Britons to the bonds of a  common imperial culture.

 The doctrinaire nature of Calvinistic Methodism in Wales, inti- mately related in the minds of many in Welsh Calvinism with the sup- posed spiritual ‘purity’ of the Welsh language,13 clearly distinguished  it not only from the far larger and better-resourced mission societies of  the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches, and the English Methodist  movements,14 but also from other Welsh missionary enterprises, most  notably the Baptist missions in the Caribbean. The notion of being  a theologically and linguistically embattled religious community,  assiduously promoted within Welsh Calvinism almost from its origins,  played itself out in complex, even contradictory, ways when mission  obliged it to engage with a cultural world they struggled to comprehend.
 While baptised converts presented the mission with some of its most  intractable problems, those who were ambitious themselves to serve  as active evangelists often generated unresolvable tensions between  missionaries in the field and their managers in the home church.  Much revolved around status within the local church structures, and  remuneration.69 Joy Gobinda Shome, one of William Pryse’s earliest  converts, had demanded the status and salary and allowances of a  European missionary, and when he was refused, he began to study for  the Bar and started ‘to wage war against European Missionaries’. While  practising as a Pleader in the Calcutta High Court, Shome joined the  Free Church of Scotland and became one of its Elders. Later, he and  Kali Charan Bannerjee formed their own church, the Christo-Somaj,  and started the Indian Christian Herald as an outlet, the Welsh Church  claimed, for ‘Shome’s spleen against Missionaries’.70

 Burnett, despite her years in America, maintained close ties to England, and even while living in the United States would have been aware of English empire-building and women’s role within it. As we have already seen, women are important in the imagery of empire insofar as empire was often presented in metaphoric guise as a family, with Queen Victoria the head of the “mother country,” and colonial subjects as immature children in need of discipline and order given by the “mother” imperial power. But beyond metaphor, women had a real and important role in the building of the British empire. They went to the colonies as missionaries and educators; as wives; and occasionally as servants. Even women who stayed at home in England were involved in domestic imperial endeavors. There has been much excellent recent work on the role of English women in British colonialism and empire, including Jenny Sharpe’s Allegories of Empire, Susan Meyer’s Imperialism at Home, and Julia Bush’s Edwardian Ladies and Imperial Power.4 There were at least 250,000 Englishwomen involved in a variety of domestic groups and societies whose purpose was to encourage emigration to the colonies, or to improve the lot of women (both native and English) in the colonies, and in general to propagate imperialism at home and abroad—societies like the Girls Friendly Society, the Primrose League, the British Women’s Emigration Association, and the Victoria League.5 The last was founded under the direct influence of Viscount Alfred Milner, high commissioner of South Africa (1897–1905) and the British official most directly responsible for the Boer War: an intransigent imperialist. His patronage of the Victoria League—as well as patronage by the Queen, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the headmasters of Eton, Harrow, and Westminster, and by Kipling—points to the prestige and potential influence of the league and its women members in areas ranging from education to foreign policy.
 It started unpromisingly enough. Beginning in the 1550s, successive En glish mon- archs, exasperated by ongoing rebellions and other anti- English activities by their sup- posedly loyal Irish subordinates, developed schemes for the “plantation,” or colonization,  of portions of Ireland. As in so much of what was to come, Ireland would become both a  useful laboratory for En glish empire- builders to test out their plans, and a dire warn- ing of just how wrong  those plans could go.  After the earliest plantations suffered  violent raids by dispossessed Irish, subsequent plantations  were accomplished via  massive terror campaigns led by Crown forces against recalcitrant locals. A semisuc- cessful plantation in southern Ireland in 1583 was followed by a much more conse- quential undertaking in the north in 1607, which created a permanent and power ful  Protestant enclave in what had been a strongly Catholic land. Ireland, which  today is  split into a predominately Catholic south and a mostly Protestant north, is still deal- ing with the fallout from Britain’s first  great experiment in mass colonization.
 The roots of British espionage can be traced to the 16th  century and the En glish Ref- ormation, when the need arose to protect Queen Elizabeth I (r. 1558–1603), a Protes- tant, from Catholic plots and conspiracies. Sir Francis Walsingham (1532–1590), the  secretary of state, or ga nized a large and effective intelligence ser vice that made use of  En glish merchants overseas and undercover agents working both in  England and  abroad. By means of this spy network, Walsingham tracked the activities of Catholic  priests in  England, received advance warning from Spain of plans to launch the  Armada (1588), and unraveled the plots against Elizabeth that formed around Mary,  Queen of Scots, including the Throckmorton Plot (1583) and the Babington Plot (1586).
 The roots of British evangelicalism can be traced back to the 16th  century, when the  word “evangelical,” used to indicate a notable commitment to the Christian gospel,  entered into the En glish language courtesy of William Tyndale (ca. 1494–1536). This  development mirrored the formulation evangelische Kirche used by the Protestant  Reformers on the Continent as a means of differentiating the Reformed fidelity to  the Gospel from the alleged excesses of the Roman Catholic Church. In contrast to  the continental usage, however, “evangelical” did not connote a distinctive religious  identity  until the late 18th  century, at the earliest.
 From the 17th  century onward,  religious revival movements regu- larly emerged in Britain, notably  in Scotland and the north of Ire- land.  These  were characterized by  large numbers of working- class  participants, as well as by skepti- cism  toward the religious hierar- chies of the established Church  of   England, although this very  rarely translated into unambigu- ous anticlericalism.  These reviv- als  were largely suppressed within   England and Wales by the Claren- don Code (1661–1665). Beginning  in the 1730s, a small evangelical  movement arose at Oxford  under  the influence of John Wesley (1703– 1791), Charles Wesley (1707–1788),  and George Whitefield (1714–1770).  Initially focused on reforming  the  spiritual life of the Church of   England, the movement eventu- ally  separated due to disagree- ments over the ordination of lay  preachers— particularly for work  as missionaries in the colonies.  Whitefield’s preaching in the Portrait of George Whitefield, Protestant preacher   of the  Great Awakening. Whitefield made numerous  trips to the American colonies to preach Chris tian- ity in the open air. His power ful oratory caused  scenes of mass enthusiasm and challenged the  authority of established ministers. (Library of  Congress) colonies is widely credited with originating the First  Great Awakening. In 1768, Selina  Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon (1707–1791), founded a college to train Methodist  students who had been expelled from Oxford for ministry. In 1783, the first ordination  ser vice of the Countess of Huntingdon’s Connexion was held, signaling a firm break  with the Church of  England.
 In 1687 James issued the Declaration of Indulgence and abolished the penal laws  against non- Anglican Protestants. Subsequently, in April 1687, the king ordered the  Declaration of Indulgence to be pronounced from  every pulpit on the two forthcom- ing Sundays. Seven bishops headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury William Sancroft  (1617–1693) petitioned the king against this order and  were charged with sedition. On  June 8  these seven bishops  were put into captivity. The acquittal of  these bishops coin- cided with the birth of Queen Mary’s son, James Francis Edward, who was baptized as a Roman Catholic. The prospect of an impending Catholic dynasty, with  little parlia- mentary intervention, gave rise to many rumors about the true parentage of the prince.   These developments added fuel to the already volatile po liti cal situation. On June 30  the jury acquitted the seven bishops  after a brief trial, which was celebrated by the anti-  Catholic public. The same day, seven prominent po liti cal leaders signed the “Letter of  Invitation” urging William of Orange, the Protestant son- in- law and nephew of James,  to intervene and break the deadlock between Crown and Parliament.
 The Protestant Reformation began in  England in 1534, when Parliament passed  the  Act of Supremacy, establishing the king as the Supreme Head of the Church of   England. Through the years 1536 and 1541 a series of statutes effectively dispossessed  all Catholic institutions in  England, Ireland, and Wales. En glish estate maps prolifer- ated, providing detailed descriptions of the landed gentry’s new acquisitions.  Later,  similar property maps  were made of Ireland, whose national lands  were considered  British landholdings. Regular geographic, geologic, mining, and military surveys   were crucial tools supporting  Great Britain’s entry into the Industrial Age.
 The origins of British humanitarian relief can be found in the desire to protect  those  escaping religious persecution. Initially this meant Protestants fleeing Catholic oppres- sion, but  after the 1789 French Revolution, when secular revolutionaries began perse- cuting French Catholics, Britons embraced a more universal vision of sanctuary for  refugees. The desire to protect a wider range of vulnerable groups led to two signifi- cant developments. First, humanitarians advocated for the end of the international  slave trade. Second, many Britons came to support interventions abroad to protect per- secuted groups.
 Royal colony governance developed in tandem with corporate and proprietary col- onies, and by the latter half of the 18th  century many colonies  were royal colonies.  Some  were created as royal colonies, some had prior charters revoked, and some  were  voluntarily surrendered. The Crown experimented with making colonial law directly  in royal colonies, but the effort failed and lawmaking powers  were once again dele- gated to legislative assemblies in the colonies with the caveat that colonial laws must  not be “repugnant” to En glish law.
 Policemen  were distinguished from other state servants by their authorized capac- ity to coerce civilians. But in  England, from 1829 onward, they increasingly sought  ac cep tance from the populace.  Under this “new police” ethos— policing by consent—  constables in  England  were supposed to protect rather than oppress the public. Focus- ing on suppressing be hav ior deemed to be antisocial, and basing their methods on  intensely scrutinizing society, they sought primarily to prevent crimes, with detection  of offenders as a backup. When it was necessary to detain or coerce, they  were expected  to use minimal force. The aim was to attain a society in which most  people policed  themselves, at least most of the time; state discipline would need to be applied only to  recalcitrant individuals rather than to collectivities.
 One of the primary functions of imperial propaganda was to create a sharp delin- eation between the history of the British Isles (also known as the metropole) and the  British Empire. Since the 16th   century, religious propaganda by the En glish state  ensured that the inhabitants of the British Isles  were projected as primarily Protestant,  despite the complex va ri e ties of Protestantism practiced in the islands and the per sis- tence of Irish Catholicism. The exceptional Protestant character of the Church of   England founded  under Henry VIII (1491–1547) was championed in official histories,  resulting in a distorted narrative of Chris tian ity in  England: with few references to  Henry VIII’s marital proclivities, official histories dismissed the contributions of  St. Augustine of Canterbury, Bede, Wycliffe, and the Diggers and Levellers, the radi- cal demo crats of the En glish Revolution. From the 18th  century onward, when the ter- ritoriality of the En glish Crown encompassed not only  England, Wales, and Scotland,  but also Ireland, Jamaica, Barbados, the Leeward Islands, the mainland colonies of  North Amer i ca, and newer colonial acquisitions in Africa, India, Australia, and New  Zealand, sustained propaganda (founded on self- perpetuating myths of commercial  supremacy and the maritime invincibility of the Royal Navy) led to the consolidation  of the idea of a “British Empire” as something that was “above all and beyond all other  such polities, Protestant, commercial, maritime and  free” (Armitage 2004, 8).
 A meeting of the Anti- Slavery Society in Exeter Hall, London, in 1841. Following the  abolition of slavery in the British West Indies in the 1830s, the Anti- Slavery Society continued  to push for the abolition of slavery worldwide. (Library of Congress) Boy Scouts The Boy Scouts  were founded in 1907 by Sir Robert Baden- Powell (1857–1941),  later  made a baron. The Scouts  were one of a number of “muscular Christian” groups formed  in the late 1800s and early 1900s such as the Salvation Army, the Boys’ Brigade, the  Anglican Church Lads’ Brigade, the Nonconformist Boys’ Life Brigade, and their Jew- ish and Catholic equivalents. Other groups like the Boys’ Empire League, the Boys’  Naval Brigade, and the Boys’  Rifle Brigade emphasized imperial patriotism, with less  focus on the religious dimension. For Scouts, the imperial connection meant that  Scouts dressed in a uniform of shorts, a Canadian broad- brimmed hat, and a walking  staff that was Ashanti/West African in origin. Scouting emphasized the outdoor life,  and Baden- Powell hoped to infuse En glish boys with a vigorous frontier ethos and  manliness.
 WHIGS The Whigs  were a po liti cal grouping (but never  really a “party” in the modern sense)  that cohered during the Exclusion Crisis of 1679–1681. As with their Tory rivals, their  name was initially a term of abuse applied to them by their opponents, Whig being a  derivation of a Scottish term for rebellious religious nonconformists. Although it is  difficult to assign a coherent or consistent po liti cal ideology to the Whigs, they  were  united by their opposition to the accession of the Catholic James II, and,  after the suc- cessful installation of William III in 1688, they tended to embrace more fervently than  the Tories the idea of a limited or constitutional monarchy (based on the belief that  power derived from “the  people”), as well as anti- Catholicism. For most of the  18th  century the Whigs dominated British politics, enjoying influence over the mon- archs and control of lucrative state patronage networks, while the Tories  were  reduced to a rump opposition tainted by their association with Catholicism. Party  alignments began to shift with the French and American crises of the 1780s, and by the  early 19th  century the Whigs  were coming to be identified with “liberal” or “progres- sive” policies, especially in economic  matters, while their Tory rivals stood for tradi- tion, anti- Enlightenment reaction, and the primacy of Crown and Church.
 In spite of  these significant handicaps two men seemed poised to help missionaries  begin to make inroads, in some cases literally, into Africa. The first was Henry Venn  (1796–1873), who  imagined creating churches that  were self- supporting, self- sustaining,  and self- propagating. This church of the three selves, as it is sometimes called, envi- sioned missionaries eventually giving way to Africans and Asians who would have  control of their own ecclesiastical affairs. The second impor tant missionary was a  product of this approach. Samuel Ajayi Crowther (ca. 1807–1891) was a Yoruba convert  (and protégé of Venn’s) in what is now western Nigeria, who became the first African  bishop in the Church of  England and led evangelical efforts along the Niger River. For  the next  century missionaries continued to travel the width and breadth of Africa  attempting to plant churches and  running mission stations. Each of  these outposts created new generations of African Christians who took Eu ro pean Chris tian ity and  made it their own with new rituals, theology, and cultures.
 In his waning years Morgan became obsessed with his public image. Looking to  overcome his reputation as a “rover” and buccaneer, he advertised his work combating  piracy in En glish newspapers. Having been sympathetic to radical Protestantism in the Civil War Era, he now projected outward faithfulness to mainstream Anglicanism. In  this way, he hoped to associate himself with the gentry of Britain.
 After graduating from Achimota in 1930, Nkrumah taught for three years at Roman  Catholic schools in Elmina and Axim. His growing interest in nationalist politics was  encouraged by encounters with S. R. Wood, the secretary of the National Congress of  British West Africa, and Nnamdi Azikiwe, the Nigerian editor of The African Morning  Post. In 1933 Nkrumah took a teaching position at the new Roman Catholic seminary  at Amissano. He considered entering the priesthood, but his religious commitment  had eroded during his time at Achimota.
 EDMUND BURKE (1729–1797) Edmund Burke was an Anglo- Irish gradu ate of Trinity College, author, and politician  who served in the House of Commons for the Whig Party. Burke was a renowned ora- tor who heavi ly influenced British debates about a wide variety of topics, including  po liti cal equality for Catholics, the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and  British involvement in India. Burke fought for the relaxation of the strict laws that sup- pressed Catholics in Ireland for many years, supported the cause of the American colo- nists in their conflict with Parliament, and, in 1787, led a committee that investigated  the East India Com pany’s activities in India. His influential Reflections on the Revolution  in France (1790) was one of the most intellectually sophisticated critiques of po liti cal  radicalism,  whether in France or Britain itself. Suspicious of sweeping revolutionary proj- ects that sought to remake society according to abstract master plans, Burke argued  instead of the importance of tradition, institutional religion, and the stability that an  elite class, imbued with a sense of hereditary privilege and duty, can bring to a society.  He is often regarded as the  father of modern po liti cal conservatism.
 Protestant Reformation (1517) The Protestant Reformation was a watershed moment in the history of Eu ro pean  Chris tian ity, a time when monarchs, intellectuals, clerics, and ordinary  people began  challenging— and, ultimately, denying— the authority of the Catholic Church. When  it came to  England in the mid-16th   century the Reformation not only transformed  the country’s religious and po liti cal life, it also played an impor tant role in motivating  and shaping the country’s earliest imperial endeavors in Ireland and North Amer i ca.
 Martin Luther (1483–1546) ignited the Protestant Reformation in Germany in 1517.  His influence quickly spread throughout the continent and British Isles. In 1534 the  En glish Parliament issued The Act of Supremacy, which declared King Henry VIII  (1491–1547), and subsequent En glish monarchs, the Supreme Head of the En glish  Church and pronounced the Pope’s authority in  England invalid. Henry had no inten- tion of changing the theological basis of the En glish Church, but  after 1534 Protestant  sympathizers began to call for theological change. This increased in the reign of  Edward VI (1537–1553), Henry’s only son and first heir, who began theologically alter- ing the En glish Church, reducing its reliance on rituals and “superstitious” practices.   After Edward’s death his elder  sister, Mary I (1516–1558), returned  England to Catholi- cism, but she too died  after a short reign. Elizabeth I (1533–1603) became Queen in  1558 and returned  England to Protestantism, but it was not as zealous as Edward’s.  Elizabeth’s “via media” theology avoided extremism to accommodate diff er ent points  of view and avoid rebellion. However, extreme Protestants, known as Puritans, wanted  Elizabeth to return to Edward’s Protestantism.
 England’s Protestant identity put it in direct conflict with its Eu ro pean rivals Spain  and France. As Spain and France  were seeking colonies, Elizabeth saw colonization as  a necessity, both to increase  England’s economic and po liti cal strength and to advance  Protestantism. This was first evident in Ireland from the 1580s. In the 12th  century   England had conquered portions of Ireland, the early En glish settlers becoming known  as Old En glish. Although the Old En glish retained ties with  England, they also culti- vated their own identity, often adopting Irish customs.  After Elizabeth’s accession the  En glish Church began pushing Protestantism in Ireland, sparking rebellions in 1580.  En glish propaganda denounced the Irish as inferior and godless  people who needed  God’s chosen  people, the Protestant En glish, to help them. So began the Irish planta- tion system: planting En glish settlers to introduce En glish religion, culture, and dom- inance. One of the leading organizers of Elizabeth’s Irish system, Walter Raleigh  (1554–1618), hoped to introduce this system to the New World as well. Irish colonization,  with its religious overtones, directly influenced the coming American colonization,  with En glish Protestantism as a major motivating  factor.
 Raleigh established the 1585 Roanoke colony in modern- day North Carolina. He had  three reasons for colonizing: promoting Chris tian ity, facilitating trade networks, and  claiming territory for  England. Raleigh and  others adapted anti- Irish propaganda to  the Native American  peoples they encountered, maintaining that Native Americans  needed the guidance of God’s chosen Protestant En glish to help them advance. Another  re spect in which En glish Protestantism motivated its North American colonial efforts  could be seen in  England’s determination to establish colonies between Spanish Flor- ida and French Canada, thereby keeping the Amer i cas from becoming wholly Catho- lic. With Catholicism spreading and Spanish and French domestic economies profiting  from growing trade networks,  England would become a small Protestant nation among  growing rivals.  England had to expand to protect its Reformation.
 Raleigh’s colony did not prevail and had wholly, and mysteriously, dis appeared by  1590. In 1607  England established a new colony, Jamestown, in the  Virginia colony.  Although largely an economic outpost, Jamestown also fiercely asserted its Anglican  Protestant identity.
 Meanwhile the Protestant Reformation continued in  England. The Puritans, who  had challenged Elizabeth’s religious regime, expressed more dissatisfaction with the  Church of  England during the reigns of King James I (1566–1625) and Charles I (1600– 1649). The Puritan majority remained in the Church of  England, but a minority of   Separatists desired a full break and a colony abroad.  After first traveling to Holland, in  1620 a group of 120 Separatists made the journey to New  England and established  Plymouth Colony. The Separatists,  later termed Pilgrims, sought a perfectly Reformed  society. They hoped to show what the perfect Protestant community could look like  and, perhaps, spark further Reformation in the  mother country. This failed, however,  and in the 1630s stronger anti- Puritan legislation forced thousands more to leave for  Amer i ca during the “ Great Migration.” John Winthrop (1587–1649) led this second  Puritan wave and established Boston as the center of the Mas sa chu setts Colony.
 The Puritans  were not the only Protestants facing persecution. From 1650 onward  the Quakers  were also mistreated. Around 1670 William Penn (1644–1718) began seek- ing greater toleration for himself and his fellow Quakers. He earned support from  James, Duke of York, and  later King James II (1633–1701), a devout Catholic facing sim- ilar scrutiny in Protestant  England. James helped Penn earn a colonial license to  settle  in modern- day Pennsylvania. Unlike Anglican  Virginia and Puritan New  England,  Pennsylvania was a “ Free Colony,” granting equal rights to all colonists regardless of  religion, social standing, or nationality.
 Mary land was a Catholic colony directly influenced by the Reformation. As  England  cultivated a strong Protestant identity, Catholics lost  legal and religious rights. In 1632  Charles I gave George Calvert, 1st Lord of Baltimore (1579–1631), 12 million acres in  the Chesapeake Bay Colony, just north of the  Virginia settlement. Although Charles  was a Protestant, his wife, Henrietta Maria, was Catholic, and he sympathized with  her and other En glish Catholics. He wanted Mary land, named for her, to be a safe  haven for En glish Catholics to escape Reformation- related persecution. Mary land was  not the ideal Catholic colony, however. Many of the colonists  were Protestants who  continued to challenge colonial Catholics through the 1680s.

 The English sense of empire envy only grew more acute after the Reformation, when proponents of war against Catholic Spain began to argue that England had a religious duty to build a Protestant empire to match the ‘Popish’ empires of the Spanish and Portuguese. The Elizabethan scholar Richard Hakluyt argued that if the Pope could give Ferdinand and Isabella the right to occupy ‘such island and lands ... as you may have discovered or are about to discover’ outside Christendom, the English crown had a duty to ‘enlarge and advance ... the faith of Christ’ on behalf of Protestantism. The English conception of empire was thus formed in reaction to that of her Spanish rival. England’s empire was to be based on Protestantism; Spain’s rested on Popery.
 For more than a century there had been a tacit tug of war between centre and periphery – between royal authority in London, as represented by the centrally appointed colonial governors, and the power of the colonists’ elected assemblies. It had been a distinctive feature of the early British settlements in America, particularly those in New England, that they had nurtured representative institutions (here was another important difference between North and South America). By comparison, the attempts to plant European-style hereditary aristocracies had comprehensively failed. From 1675 onwards, however, London sought to increase its influence over the colonies, which in their early years had been to all intents and purposes autonomous. Until that time only Virginia had been designated a ‘crown colony’. But in 1679 New Hampshire was declared a royal province and five years later Massachusetts became the ‘Dominion of New England’. New York came under direct royal authority when its own proprietor became King in 1685, and Rhode Island and Connecticut accepted royal takeovers in rapid succession thereafter.
 Nowadays that sounds about as revolutionary as motherhood and apple pie. But at the time it was an explosive challenge not just to royal authority but to the traditional values of a hierarchical, Christian society. Before 1776 the debate about the colonies’ future had very largely been couched in terms familiar from the British constitutional wrangles of the previous century. With the publication of Thomas Paine’s Common Sense in 1776, however, an entirely new idea had entered the political debate, and with breathtaking speed carried the day: anti-monarchism, with the strong implication of republicanism. Of course, a republic was nothing new. The Venetians, the Hanseatic Germans, the Swiss and the Dutch all had them; indeed, the British themselves had conducted their own brief experiment with republicanism in the 1650s. But Jefferson’s preamble ensured that the American republic would be fashioned in the terms of the Enlightenment: in terms of natural rights – above all the right of every individual ‘to judge for himself what will secure or endanger his freedom’.
 The obvious place to start missionary work in Africa was Freetown. As early as 1804 the Church Missionary Society had begun work there, followed soon after by the Methodists. Both set about converting the Yoruba ‘Recaptives’ (freed slaves brought to Freetown by the intervention of the Navy). But the intention from the outset was to send missionaries not just to Africa. Anglican missionaries went out to the most remote of British colonies, New Zealand, as early as 1809. On Christmas Day 1814 Samuel Marsden preached from the text ‘Behold, I bring you tidings of great joy’ to a congregation of uncomprehending Maoris. His survival seems to have attracted others. The Methodists established a mission there in 1823, the Roman Catholics in 1838. By 1839 the Anglicans had eleven mission stations in New Zealand to the Methodists’ six. Perhaps the most successful of the early New Zealand missionaries was the Anglican Henry Williams, a fearless exsailor who worked there from 1823 until his death in 1867, building the first church (at Paihia) and translating the Bible into Maori. Williams succeeded in winning the respect of the Maoris, not least by intervening to remind them of the Gospel in the middle of a pitched battle. But not every missionary could get away with such challenges to traditional mores. The Revd Carl S. Volkner came to New Zealand in the 1850s, but fell out of favour with the Opitiki Maoris by urging them to desist from bloodshed when war broke out with a rival clan in 1865. One of the Opitiki chiefs hanged him, shot him, decapitated him in his own church, drank his blood and swallowed both his eyes.
 In 1813, however, the company’s charter came up for renewal, and the Evangelicals seized their chance to end its control over missionary activity in India. The old orientalism was about to clash head-on with the new evangelicalism.
 But the second Bishop of Calcutta, Reginald Heber, offered the missionaries more encouragement after his appointment in 1823. Nine years later there were fifty-eight Church Missionary Society preachers active in India. The clash of civilizations had begun.

 6. Marchant married a clergyman, Reverend Jabez Ambrose Comfort, at the age  of thirty- seven, which places the event chronologically close to the publication  of this novel. She also assisted in training Methodist ministers and, according  to her obituary, undertook ‘the functions of a lay preacher’ (1941, p. 569).

 Many of the early colonies had brief histories, victims of internal disputes, predations by indigenous groups, and the vagaries of unfamiliar environ- ments. Frequently, too, charters were revoked as businesses failed or because the crown decided to exercise more control itself; in 1624, for example, King James I rescinded the charter of the debt-ridden Virginia Company and made its territories a royal colony, much like Ireland in that it was ruled by officials who were directly responsible to the monarch. However, many of the settle- ments survived and evolved systems of administration that reflected the structures and values of the societies that were being shaped in the New World. In 1619, immigrants gathered “to establish one equal and uniform government” for Virginia and to create “just laws for the happy guiding and governing of the people.” Farther north, in New England, Puritan commu- nities adopted very different regulations for community control, based on their religious values, but common to all was a sense of independence and a resistance to attempts by outsiders to impose change. Given the slow nature of transatlantic communication in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was impos- sible for an English (or, from 1707, when the parliaments of England and Scotland united, a British) government to exercise close oversight over activ- ities in the colonies, and moreover, until 1768, when the British government created a Colonial Department, responsibility for territorial possessions rested largely with the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, which 4 • INTRODUCTION served more as an advisor to the monarch than as a policy-making unit. As a result, the American colonies and their governors were left largely to their own devices.
 114 • CAREY, WILLIAM (1761–1834) CAREY, WILLIAM (1761–1834). William Carey’s efforts to convert In- dians to Christianity brought limited returns, but he laid a foundation for 19th-century missionary work throughout the British Empire and, in India, pioneered educational innovations and social reforms that reflected British cultural norms. The son of weavers Edmund and Elizabeth Carey, he was born in Paulersbury, in Northamptonshire, England, on 17 August 1761 and received his only formal education from his father, who was appointed vil- lage schoolmaster when William was six years old. As a boy, he attended Church of England services with his parents, but from the age of 14 (when he was apprenticed to a shoemaker) he associated with members of noncon- formist sects and, in 1783, was baptized as a Baptist. Shortly afterward, while reading accounts of Captain James Cook’s voyages, he became con- cerned about the spiritual health of populations that were being brought into contact with Europeans, presenting his thoughts in a pamphlet entitled An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens. That publication, which appeared in 1792, encouraged a group of ministers to join him in forming a Particular Baptist Society for the Propagation of the Gospel among the Heathen. The first of numerous British evangelical missionary associations, it was later renamed the Baptist Mis- sionary Society and provided a template for similar organizations founded in Europe and North America (see LONDON MISSIONARY SOCIETY). In December of 1793, Carey traveled to India with John Thomas, a former East India Company (EIC) doctor who had decided to become a missionary. Initially, the men settled in Calcutta (now Kolkata) with their families, but, as funds diminished, Carey moved west to Midnapore, taking a job as manager of an indigo factory. However, the EIC opposed missionary work, believing that it would disrupt commerce, so in 1800 he uprooted himself again and, on 10 January, joined teacher Joshua Marshman and printer William Ward in Serampore, then a Danish colony.
 CHURCH MISSIONARY (OR MISSION) SOCIETY. On 12 April 1799, a group of evangelical Christians (including William Wilberforce, one of the strongest voices advocating an end to the slave trade) formed a Society for Missions to Africa and the East, renaming it the Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East (CMS) in 1812. Initially linked to the Church of England, the CMS quickly developed contacts with other Protestant organ- izations when, to its surprise, it found that few Anglican clergy were willing to commit themselves to its cause. The first missionaries sent overseas— Peter Hartwig and Melchior Renner of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Wurtemburg—had trained in Berlin and arrived in Sierra Leone to work with a community of freed slaves in 1804. In succeeding decades, their colleagues spread widely across the globe, attempting to take the Christian faith to areas as far apart as the West Indies (from 1813), New Zealand (from 1814), India (from 1816), the Hudson Bay area of North America (from 1822), Australia (from 1825), East Africa (from 1844, in the area that became the East Africa Protectorate), and Nigeria (also from 1844). They also ventured well beyond the bounds of the British Empire, basing them- selves in Abyssinia from 1829, in China from 1844, in Japan (where the first mission post was established at Nagasaki in 1869), and in Rwanda (where missionaries proselytized from 1914). Like similar groups, the CMS invested considerable effort in providing educational and training facilities as well as in evangelizing. Thus, for example, the colleges founded in Kottayam, India, in 1817 and at Fourah Bay, Sierra Leone, in 1827 evolved into degree- granting institutions, and the hospital established at Hangzhou, China, in 1817 is now affiliated to Zhejiang University’s medical school. Many of the first workers at the 19th-century schools and clinics were the wives of mis- CLIVE, ROBERT (1725–1774) • 129 sionaries, but in 1897 a recruitment campaign aimed at unmarried women met with an enthusiastic response so within four years more than 300 addi- tional females were based at foreign locations. In 1922, the Society split when a group of conservative members broke away to form the Bible Churchmen’s Missionary Society (renamed Crosslinks in 1992), but, despite increasing secularization in the United Kingdom, it still had strong represen- tation abroad at the start of the 21st century, with nearly 40 workers stationed in former British colonies and about 100 in other locations, principally in South America.
 LONDON MISSIONARY SOCIETY. The London Missionary Society (LMS) was built, like many similar groups (see CHURCH MISSIONARY (OR MISSION) SOCIETY), on the foundation of late 18th-century enthu- siasm for evangelical Protestantism in Britain. In a pamphlet published in 1792, William Carey (who later became a Baptist missionary in India) advocated the formation of a multidenominational body that would coordi- nate the activities of several churches and thus maximize resource use. His plea fell on fertile soil; on 22 September 1795, a Missionary Society was formed at a meeting in Spa Fields Chapel, a focus for evangelical Christians in London, with the aim of spreading “the knowledge of Christ among heath- en and other unenlightened nations.” The organization was renamed the Lon- don Missionary Society in 1818 and, throughout its history, derived its strongest support from the Congregational Church.
 After the end of World War II, the political and social context of mission- ary work changed. Former colonies won independence and their churches gained greater autonomy; thus, for example, Congregational, Episcopal, Methodist, and Presbyterian groups combined as the Church of South India in 1947. Also, British society became more secularized, reducing interest in missions and restricting the flow of funds to organizations still committed to proselytizing. In an attempt to meet the new challenges, LMS merged with the Commonwealth Missionary Society in 1966 to form the Congregational Council for World Mission, which was renamed the Council for World Mis- sion (CWM) in 1977. By the beginning of the 21st century, the CWM was coordinating missionary efforts by 31 independent denominations, mainly in former Empire territories in the Caribbean, eastern and southern Asia, the Pacific Islands, and southern Africa.
 A committed member of the Free Church of Scotland, Mackinnon estab- lished the East African Scottish Mission in 1892; the single place of worship that opened in Kibwezi (now in Kenya) evolved into the Presbyterian Church of East Africa. He was created a baronet by Queen Victoria in 1889 and died in the Burlington Hotel in London on 22 June 1893. In its obituary, the Glasgow Herald commented on the “shrewdness, foresight and business ability” that had made him, according to colonial administrator Henry Bartle Frere, the “little Scotsman” who was “the mainspring of British enterprise on the Persian Gulf” for much of the second half of the 19th century.
 MASSACHUSETTS. The lands along the northeast coast of North America may have been known to Viking seafarers by the end of the first millenium AD, and extensive areas were certainly mapped by 1614. Several English groups attempted to build settlements along the Atlantic shores between the promontories now known as Cape Ann and Cape Cod during the early decades of the 17th century, but just two, both characterized by strong relig- ious commitment, thrived. One, usually known as the Pilgrims or the Pilgrim Fathers, sought refuge both from persecution in England and from liberal attitudes in Holland, landing on 21 December 1620 at a site it named Ply- mouth after the port from which it had sailed. The other, a Puritan commu- nity that wanted to reform the Church of England (and thus differed from the Plymouth settlers, who sought to worship outside the Anglican fold), estab- lished itself farther north, in Massachusetts Bay, from 1628. The Massachu- setts Bay Colony was the more successful, numbering some 20,000 residents (nearly seven times as many as at Plymouth) by the 1640s and expanding westward to the productive soils in the Connecticut River Valley. The lead- MASSACHUSETTS • 319 ers’ intolerance of community members who questioned their beliefs and principles also contributed to that changing settlement frontier; for example, Roger Williams traveled south after being found guilty of heresy in 1635 and created a more tolerant regime at Providence Plantation, which became the core of the modern American state of Rhode Island, and John Wheelwright, found guilty of sedition in 1637, went north and built anew in New Hamp- shire and Maine. Thomas Hooker left of his own accord and, in 1636, with 100 supporters, founded a village that evolved into Hartford, capital of the State of Connecticut.
 MISSIONARIES. Although territorial expansion was determined primarily by commerce and by political priorities, Britain’s growing Empire provided opportunities for numerous religious groups to take the Christian message to a world they considered uncivilized. As early as the mid-17th century, John Eliot was attempting to convert Native Americans in Massachusetts to his Puritan faith, but efforts to coordinate the activities of evangelists were very limited prior to the formation of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts on 16 June 1701. Initially, that organization, repre- senting the Church of England and its sister bodies, concentrated on Britain’s American colonies and on the West Indies, working with “heathens and infidels” as well as with white settlers and spreading the Church of England version of the Protestant gospel. In 1751, however, it also established a base in West Africa, and by 1800 it had representatives in Australia and New Zealand.
 The nonconformist sects had little involvement in missionary activity until 1792, when shoemaker William Carey published his Enquiry into the Obli- gations of Christians to Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens. At the time, Britain was experiencing a surge of religious enthusiasm so the pleas had a receptive audience. Within months, the Particular Baptist Society for the Propagation of the Gospel among the Heathen (soon known as the Baptist Missionary Society) was formed (and sent Carey to India in 1793). The London Missionary Society (LMS), multidenominational but sup- ported primarily by the Congregational Church, followed in 1795 and oth- ers—such as the Glasgow Society for Foreign Missions (established in 1796) and the Society for Missions to Africa and the East (founded in 1799 and later known as the Church Missionary Society)—in the last years of the 18th century and the early years of the 19th.
 SOCIETY FOR THE PROPAGATION OF THE GOSPEL IN FOREIGN PARTS. At the instigation of the Reverend Thomas Bray, who had attempted to increase the resources available to Church of England work- ers in Maryland, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) was founded by royal charter on 16 June 1701 with the aim of supporting Anglican clergy working in the American colonies. The organiza- tion’s first representative—the Reverend George Keith (a former surveyor- general of New Jersey who abandoned his Quaker upbringing and became a deacon in the Church of England)—was dispatched to Boston, in the Massa- chusetts Bay Colony, the following year and the first missionaries to the West Indies reached the islands in 1703. By 1710, SPG leaders were giving work with “heathens and infidels” priority over other responsibilities, and thereafter the Society became the principal agent of Church of England mis- sionary activities throughout the British Empire. By 1785, when American independence ended its role in the region, it had sent more than 300 ordained priests (including John Wesley, cofounder of the Methodist Church) to the area and distributed thousands of Bibles.
 Using texts from the book of Genesis to justify its actions, the SPG kept more than 400 slaves on a plantation on Barbados from 1710 until 1833, but it also founded health clinics and educational institutions; Codrington Col- lege in St. John, Barbados, opened as a high school in 1745, for example. In 1751, the Rev. Thomas Thompson began mission work at James Fort, on the Gambia River in West Africa—Philip Quaque, whom Thompson sent to London to be educated, became, in 1766, the first African to be ordained as a priest by the Church of England—and by the end of the century the organiza- tion was also well established in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. In the 1820s, SPG representatives took their faith to India and southern Africa, 488 • SOLOMON ISLANDS the first female missionary (Sarah Coombes) landed in North Borneo in 1856, and by 1873 other workers had gone beyond the boundaries of the British Empire into China and Japan. As the group’s commitments expanded, church leaders trained local converts to work as missionaries and, particular- ly from 1895, recruited women who would both spread the Christian mes- sage and teach girls in the mission fields. However, in the years after World War II, the increasing secularization of British society resulted in a decline of interest in missionary activity. Also, as decolonization gathered pace, churches in former British possessions developed their own identities (which were often more conservative than the parent church in the United King- dom), and SPG began to work more in concert with these and other bodies that had similar interests. In 1965, it merged with the Universities’ Mission to Central Africa to form the United Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, which, by the early 21st century, had representatives in more than 50 countries around the world, focusing on health work and leadership develop- ment as well as on religious activities.
 SPORTS AND GAMES. The impact of imperial expansion on the world distribution of sporting activities has only recently begun to receive serious attention from scholars. It is evident, however, that administrators and mili- tary personnel took cultural baggage with them as they traveled to the colo- nies and thus helped to spread knowledge of the leisure pursuits they had learned, often at school, in Britain. Some of those pursuits, such as golf and soccer, have become world sports, but others remain most popular in former territories of the Empire. Cricket, for example, was being played in England by the early 16th century and, by the 19th century, was well established in Australia, the Caribbean islands, the Indian subcontinent, New Zealand, STANLEY, HENRY MORTON (1841–1904) • 503 and southern Africa. The sport is governed by the International Cricket Council, which has 10 full members, all of whom are members—or, in the case of Zimbabwe (previously Southern Rhodesia), a former member—of the Commonwealth of Nations. Rugby evolved in mid-19th-century Eng- land from earlier forms of football and became established in Australia by 1864, New Zealand by 1870, and Cape Colony by 1875. The game is recog- nized as the national sport in Fiji, New Zealand, Samoa, and Tonga and, in its seven-a-side form (which was first played in Scotland in the 1880s), has been accepted as an Olympic Games sport. Field hockey was popularized after the formation of a Hockey Association in England in 1885, developing particularly strong followings in Australia, British India, and southern Afri- ca, and the membership of World Bowls, the international governing body for lawn bowls, is dominated by former British colonies.

 The point about all of this activity, however, is that the press was part of a wider intellectual ferment, connected in a variety of ways to the establishment of literary and scientific societies, to frontier and ‘native’ policy, to the abolition of slavery, and to missionary endeavour, partic- ularly as personified by yet another Scot, the London Missionary Society superintendent, Dr John Philip. The press, which Somerset made strenuous but failing attempts to suppress, was part of a wider creation of a bourgeois, intellectual and also commercial public sphere. The Scots were motivated not just by the ambition to influence matters of governance, religion and frontier settlement, but also to create banking, insurance and commercial institutions. The press was a vehicle for all these concerns, much influenced by Adam Smith and other figures of the Scottish Enlightenment. By 1853, the efforts of this group (in league with influential Dutch and English allies) culminated in the establishment of representative government at the Cape.
 Somerset and the ‘Scotch Independents’ Three Scottish figures dominated this tempestuous period at the Cape, and the developments of the 1820s can only be understood in terms of their background. The first of these to arrive was Dr John Philip (1775–1851), the highly influential superintendent of the London Missionary Society.8 Philip was the son of a handloom weaver from Fife, and born therefore into a social group that was to be most disadvantaged by the developing industrialism of the period. Well schooled, he worked at a mill in Dundee in the 1790s, an experience which contributed to his sense of social injustice. By 1799 he believed he had a vocation and went to the Congregationalist college at Hoxton to train as a minister. He was duly ordained in the Congregationalist Church, then increasingly powerful in Scotland, and in 1804 became minister of a church in Aberdeen. There he began to display his radical tendencies, his belief in the relationship between religion and politics, and his search for a particular kind of practical and involved evangeli- calism. He was also a powerful and popular preacher, frequently filling a large church to capacity.
 4  ‘The Old Pals’ Protection Society’?  The Colonial Office and the British  Press on the Eve of Decolonisation  Joanna Lewis and Philip Murphy As the 1950s drew to a close, there was a growing awareness on the part of British ministers and officials of the power of the media and the need for ‘news management’. As Harold Macmillan noted in his memoirs, by 1959 he and his colleagues fought elections in the company of two new developments: television and opinion polls.1 Yet there remained a tradition under which civil servants were expected to remain relatively aloof from the world of journalism, and ministers expected a degree of deference from the press. The Colonial Office (CO) in particular was keen to keep its own affairs from the critical scrutiny not only of the media but of Parliament itself, fearing that public disagreements about policy within the metropole would weaken the authority of its personnel in the colonies.2 In this regard the issues of press coverage and parliamentary scrutiny were closely interlinked. Through the mechanism of parliamentary questions, MPs may well have played a more significant role than journalists in holding the Government to account.3 Yet a large proportion of those questions were inspired by reports in the press, and ministerial replies could, in turn, encourage further investigations by the media.
 1. Harold Macmillan, Pointing the Way, 1959–1961 (London: Macmillan, 1972), p. 7.  2. See, for example, the resistance of the CO to the idea of the establishment of a specialist parliamentary committee on colonial affairs because of fears that its activities might ‘exacerbate public opinion in the colonial territories’ (Watt to Smart, 24 September 1958, CO 1032/135).
 Although New Zealand was only ‘a subplot in the diaspora of Europeans that sent as many as 50 million from the Old World to the New’,10 it became a keen and committed part of the Empire. But was the colonial experience weaker and less effective because communications were difficult? We should keep in mind that New Zealand was considered ‘More English than England!’, resulting perhaps from its isolation, so that it clung to ‘the ideas traditionally associated with the Victorian Age which nurtured her in infancy and early youth’, and was ‘untouched by the revolutionary solvents of the twentieth century’.11
 1 Amalgamating Races: The ‘New System’ of Colonization and Racial Management The settlement of New Zealand came at an unsettled time. As Boyd Hilton has argued, the first part of the nineteenth century ‘really was an “age of crisis”—politically, socially, and intellectually’. The deep-seated fear of revolution amongst governments and elites adjoined various other problems, such as free trade, currency, poor relief and, of course, reform.1
 Leading members or supporters of the Company saw themselves as ‘Colonial Reformers’, consciously aligning themselves with the reforms then underway in Britain.9 This was common at the time, as many radicals turned to the colonies seeing them as an extension of social problems in Britain, or as potential solutions to these problems.10 They were against aristocratic rule, and favoured colonial self-government but, as their 5 Mrs Hawtrey to Montague J.G.

 Polynesian hopes.’39 But Durham, Wakefield and Buller, the most promi- nent of the Colonial Reformers, saw it as another chance at colonial reform.
 régime, with its primarily agricultural and supposedly ‘priest-ridden’ ways. As with emancipation, union would incorporate through supposed terms of ‘equality’ while ensuring that differentiations and inequities were renewed, maintained or established.
 PRODUCING COLONIAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT RACE CROSSING There were no colonial branches of either the ESL or the ASL or indeed any of the other main London societies. It was expected that papers and people would be returned to London, and that these societies would work as something not unlike ‘centres of calculation’.99 But this model of scholarship was at odds with the way the Empire generally behaved, where colonies were essentially governed locally, mostly through authority delegated to autocratic Crown representatives or colonial parliaments, with only oversight and general guidance from London, and where the traffic between colonies resembled an intricate web more than the spokes on a wheel. It would be surprising if colonial governments surrendered their capacity to gather and construct knowledge to distant, scholarly, often private, realms. And they did not.
 The colonial government was proud of this document, and disseminated it widely throughout the Empire, as well as to both the WMS and CMS, the Statistical Society, the Society of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce, and the British Museum. The APS pronounced it ‘the most important document of [its] kind we have yet seen.’103 It sparked debate domestically and overseas. An Anglican bishop was moved to write his own report, agreeing that dress and food were part of the problem, but 100 Results of a Census of New Zealand, taken for the night of the 27th February 1871 (Wellington, 1872), p. v.

 6. Traditional hostility toward Roman Catholics in Great Britain has usually been  attributed to their perceived untrustworthiness and potential threat to the estab- lishment, as well as to the ongoing wars that were fought against the Catholic powers  of Europe. For classic accounts of anti- Catholicism in Britain during the eighteenth  century, see Colin Haydon, Anti- Catholicism in Eighteenth- Century England,  c. 1714– 80: A Political and Social Study (Manchester: Manchester University Press,  1993); C. D.  A. Leighton, Catholicism in a Protestant Kingdom:  A  Study of the  Irish Ancien Regime (New  York:  St. Martin’s Press, 1994); and Edward Norman,  Roman Catholicism in England from the Elizabethan Settlement to the Second  Vatican Council (Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 1985). The most influential  argument about the ways in which wars with the Catholic powers of Europe, par- ticularly France, shaped British national identity, Protestantism, and sense of dis- tinctiveness, remains Linda J. Colley, Britons: Forging the Nation, 1707– 1837 (New  Haven:  Yale University Press, 1992). Caitlin Anderson makes the argument that  both Catholics and religious non- conformists in Britain and its empire were often  viewed as being of “compromised allegiance” (204). See Caitlin Anderson, “Old  Subjects, New Subjects, and Non- Subjects:  Silences and Subjecthood,” in War,  Empire, and Slavery, 1770– 1830 eds. Jane Rendall, Nicholas Guyatt, and Richard  Bessel (Houndsmills: Palgrave, 2010), 201– 217.
 78. The religious identities of these petitioners are difficult to ascertain. They were  likely a diverse group: some may have been Catholics of Irish or Scottish origin;  some were likely nonconformists or dissenters with a vested interest in seeing  rights extended to non- Anglicans; some may have been Anglicans but chose to  differentiate themselves from the “British Protestants” who attacked the French  Catholics.
 144. More generally, opponents worried that by allowing the collection of tithes, the  Quebec Act was perceived to have established the Catholic Church in Canada.  Overall, critics believed that the act introduced a language of despotism and that,  by failing to institute an assembly, it had introduced tyrannical government, a  fear that was echoed in representations from the Continental Congress and the  Assembly of New York.

 14 For instance, by the turn of the twentieth century the Turkish nationalist movement sought to establish a more thoroughly ethnically Turkish government  and nation- state.
 Local foundations The first universities founded in British North America were established  by settlers from Britain and loyalists fleeing the American Revolution.  They sought to perpetuate in colonial communities the privileges  the Established Church enjoyed in England. As the 1802 statutes for  King’s College in Windsor, Nova Scotia, stipulated, ‘[n]o member of  the University shall frequent the Romish mass, or the meeting Houses  of Presbyterians, Baptists, or Methodists, or the Conventicles or places  of Worship of any other dissenters from the Church of England … or  shall be present at any seditious or rebellious meetings.’2 As colleges  that provided a classical education to students who were required to  affirm the 39 Articles, the ‘King’s Colleges’ these settlers established  in Windsor (1789), New Brunswick (1800, Royal Charter 1828), and  Toronto (1827, opened 1843) borrowed heavily from the model of un- reformed Oxford – with its residential colleges, confessional criteria  and classical curriculum.3 This was also the model initially proposed [ 18 ] in Australia. In the mid-1820s Thomas Scott – secretary to the Bigge  Commission of Inquiry into the conditions of settlement in the colony  – suggested the establishment of a comprehensive scheme of education  under the control of the Church of England, ranging from elementary  schools through to universities.4
 However, these attempts to extend to the colonies the monopoly  over education that the Established Church enjoyed in England pro- voked strong opposition from the numerous Presbyterian, Roman  Catholic and nonconformist groups that also comprised colonial  communities. In Sydney the Scott plan fell into abeyance, while in  British North America two other kinds of institution arose to claim  university status.5 The founders of both Dalhousie in Nova Scotia  (1818) and McGill in Montreal (1821) looked not to Oxford but to  Edin burgh. Non-residential and non-sectarian, in Edinburgh teaching  was delivered through lectures, and the curriculum included medicine  and the sciences. Open ‘to all occupations and sects of religions’,  both Dalhousie and McGill planned to offer courses in the natural  and physical sciences as well as classics and theology.6 ‘If Dalhousie  College [will] acquire usefulness and eminence,’ declared its President,  Thomas  McCulloch, ‘it will be not by an imitation of Oxford, but as  an institution of science and practical intelligence.’7 Third, alongside  these Scottish-inspired foundations, an array of denominational col- leges also emerged that modelled themselves after the nonconformist  theological training colleges in Britain and the United States.8 Founded  in the 1830s and 1840s and funded by the donations of parishioners,  these institutions aimed to train preachers and teachers by providing  a classical and religious education in a residential setting. Yet in their  early years all three kinds of university struggled to survive. Attracting  tiny numbers of students, they lacked both money and materials. In  the economic downturn of the early 1840s the denominational colleges  only just managed to remain afloat, Dalhousie did not become fully  functional until it was refounded in 1879, and McGill consisted only  of the local medical school until it acquired a faculty of arts in 1843.
 In contrast, in South Africa and New Zealand the London exam- ining model had greater success as a solution not only to religious  diversity but also to diffuse colonial populations animated by fierce  provincial loyalties. As in Canada, in New Zealand the first efforts  to establish higher education had been sponsored by the churches. A  university was central to the plans of those who settled in Wakefield’s  Church of England Colony at Canterbury in the late 1840s, and equally  important to the settlement scheme of the Scottish migrants who in  the same decade founded communities in the South Island. However,  when the Presbyterian Church in Otago endowed two chairs in the  mid-1860s, the central colonial parliament responded by introducing  its own University Endowment Act. This led the Province of Otago to  pass an ordinance that formally founded a university, which in turn led  the colonial parliament in 1870 to establish a rival ‘University of New  Zealand’. But the British Secretary of State was unwilling to grant two  Royal Charters to the small colony. The foundation in 1873 of a third  institution – an Anglican College in Christchurch called Canterbury  College – hastened compromise between them. In 1874 both Canter- bury and Otago became affiliated as founding members of the federal  ‘University of New Zealand’; a body that granted degrees in arts, law  and medicine to students who had undergone a course of study at one  of what would eventually be four constituent colleges.15
 What colonial scientists needed, thought Wilson in 1856, were publi- cations that would ‘furnish a means of intercourse among themselves,  as well as an interchange of thought and discovery with the scientific  world at large.’ He hoped that the Canadian Journal – the publication  of the Royal Canadian Institution, established in 1852 – might under  his editorship serve the purpose. But the Canadian Journal was just one [ 24 ] of several publications founded in Canada in the 1850s.28 Reflecting  the self-confidence engendered by the extension of responsible govern- ment, the middle of the century witnessed the birth of numerous such  journals and societies in the settler colonies. In Australia, branches of  the Royal Society were established in New South Wales (1850) and in  victoria (1854), with both beginning to publish their Proceedings in the  1860s; and from 1857 the Cape Monthly Magazine served the various  literary and scientific institutions that had grown up in Cape Town  in the 1830s. Important as forums for settler scientists, Saul Dubow  has argued that these journals functioned as crucial sites for the con- struction of colonial identity among the growing middle classes.29 Like  universities, they too were part of the process by which settlers sought  to localise institutions of knowledge and cultural production in this  period.
 Society. The society is governed by a principal and twelve; ancients.
 Tension between elites was not simply fuelled by criticism  from those seeking to protect a gentlemanly ideal against the  corrupting influences that were thought to be at large within  the business and financial community. There is evidence to suggest that, on the other side of the coin, the City of London  in its broadest sense was often quite resistant to aristocratic  modes of behaviour. One authority has declared that there  was a 'residual contempt for aristocratic degeneracy' ,82 and  this prevented the ready acceptance of all forms of gentle- manly conduct by the practitioners of trade, finance and busi- ness. In general, 'aristocratic' ideals were often subjected to  hostile criticism, and they could be decried as being effemin- ate, foppish and 'foreign', particularly when a more vigorous  and aggressive response to British setbacks in the wider world  was demanded from those directing the nation's political and  strategic fortunes. 83 Not everyone chose to play the game by  gentlemanly rules.
 Part Three  Overseas Elites in the British Empire 5 Imperial Ties and the  Anglicization of the  Overseas Empire The tangled web of credit and investment outlined in the  previous chapter represented one important connection be- tween Britain's overseas settlements and the metropolis, but a  wide range of other links also helped to give the empire a  sense of form and structure. These ties were not, for the most  part, unwelcome to those at the periphery because they pro- vided more in benefits than costs and ensured colonists their  defence, liberty, opportunities and material goods. Less tangi- bly, perhaps, the empire also provided colonists, and espe- cially colonial elites, with a sense of belonging, identity and  order. In the absence of a strong and regular element of co- ercion within British imperial relationships, the ties that bound  most British overseas subjects to the mother country were based  upon free association which maintained the empire's integrity  until a series of crises disrupted long-standing patterns of  communality and dependency during the 1760s. The realities  of time, space and geography were such that administrative  control from the centre was often very weak indeed, and in  areas of overseas settlement the British empire developed along  lines defined by consent and cooperation rather than coer- cion and control. This was so much the case that the authority  of London was only ever legitimized by being accepted by  those in the colonies. 1 As William Pitt argued in 1766, when he  warned the House of Commons about the dangers of redefin- ing relationships with the North American colonies, the colon- ists needed to be bound with 'the golden cord of equity and  [moderation]'. They could not be held within the empire by  'cords of iron'. 2
 THE EMERGENCE OF A TRANSOCEANIC ELITE Unlike the mother country, white colonial societies did not, in  a formal sense, possess aristocratic or gentry classes. Neverthe- less, by the eighteenth century the passage of time had seen  the emergence of colonial elites containing individuals and  families who possessed all the defining characteristics of an  aristocracy or gentry, even though they did not hold, or for  the most part have access to, the same privileges, rights and  tides as the metropolitan elite.7 Indeed, many contemporary  observers, not to mention modern-day historians, have made  use of the terms 'aristocracy' and 'gentry' to describe mem- bers of different colonial elites. By doing so, they have, in the  absence of the traditional benchmarks associated with tide and  rank, often used replicated patterns of behaviour and lifestyle,  as well as the holding of wealth, influence and political power, to define the criteria through which individuals might be placed  in an elite group in colonial society. Moreover, the use of the  terms 'aristocracy' and especially 'gentry' has been extended  beyond a narrow range of wealthy landowners or great plant- ers. These terms have often been used to describe the 'better  sort' to be found within the colonial urban sphere as well as  those located in a rural environment. This was remarked upon  by the Anglican clergyman, Arthur Browne, when he consid- ered the ways that elites had emerged in North America in  spite of the lack of a nobility or 'orders of gentry'.8 He ob- served that the 'richer merchants' in some towns 'together  with the clergy, lawyers, physicians and officers of the English  navy who had occasionally settled there were considered as  gentry.' This 'superior order' of gentleman was, in Browne's  opinion, based upon 'better property and more information',  and this social group was able, in magnanimous fashion, to  accept jealous criticism from other sections of society because  it was 'a specie of inconvenience which a liberal mind par- doned as compensated by the comfort and independence which  produced it.' In part, Arthur Browne's observations pointed to several  different types of elites having emerged in overseas colonies.  From the very beginning, elites in the mainland American  colonies developed along lines determined by immigration and  settlement, but over the longer term the composition of elites  was also conditioned by patterns of mortality and succession.  The interaction of various demographic trends meant that the  founding elites in some colonies, such as Maryland, Pennsylva- nia and Virginia, could prove to be, in the words of one his- torian, 'fragile and short-lived', as many of the first generation  failed to produce successors and new arrivals continued to  find their way to the top of colonial society.9 Over decades, as  North American colonies developed and the social structure  became more ordered, native-born individuals or creoles even- tually began to outnumber those of British birth within the  elites of different regions. 10
 In the British West Indies, members of the white elite often  fell somewhere between the type of permanent settler seen in  North America and the transient resident common to the  British settlements in India. Accordingly, creole elites emerged  more slowly than they did in mainland America, 11 but histor- ians have nevertheless identified increasing signs of elite com- mitment to their islands and identification with local society  after mid-century. 12 Although this interpretation serves as an  important corrective to the old and stereotypical view of the  Barbadian and Jamaican elite as absentee landowners, many  planters still sought an eventual return to Britain where they  could enjoy retirement living off investments consisting of  enterprises run on their behalf in the CaribbeanY The eventual repatriation of some very long-term settlers  reflected the fact that in all areas of British overseas activity,  there were always numbers of people within local elites who  sought sooner or later to return to Britain.14 Remigration played  an important part in ensuring that many of Britain's overseas  communities always contained individuals whose status was  transitory and who, as a consequence, were only partially em- bedded in local society. Within the elite, merchants, factors, military and naval personnel, administrators, functionaries and  professionals were always to be found alongside planter and  settler families of several generations. These temporary resi- dents often remained firmly tied to the mother country during  periods of service which, although initially perceived as being  short-term, could in fact last up to twenty years or more. 15
 Thus, throughout this period many of those in the British  overseas empire who focused their attention on new frontiers  or spheres of activity also regularly looked backwards over their  shoulder to the country they or their forefathers had left be- hind. This general tendency for many colonists to seek the  reassurance of an existence and lifestyle based upon patterns  of social and cultural behaviour developed in metropolitan  society was reinforced by a wide range of individual links  maintained between overseas elites and their counterparts in  Britain. Such was the nature of connections based upon mar- riage, kinship and business activity that one can point to the  emergence of a transoceanic elite, that is an elite whose asso- ciations, characteristics and interests transcended national and  regional boundaries.
 Important connections between metropolitan and colonial  elites also existed beyond the world of trade. Again, the insti- tution of marriage played an important part in helping to  forge these connections. As early as the mid-seventeenth cen- tury, intermarriage had consolidated the position of elites in  the West Indies by creating unions of interest between planter and merchant families. It had also helped to establish strong  familial bonds between the Caribbean elite and their counter- parts in Britain and North America, and this led to the even- tual development of what has been described as a 'sort of  Atlantic society'.31 Large numbers of British military officers in  America married women from leading colonial families, as was  the case with Admiral Sir Peter Warren who married into the  De Lancey family of New York in 1731. This allowed officers to  establish themselves in the upper echelons of colonial society  and, as in Warren's case, it could give them access to the  financial resources necessary for them to move successfully  into the world of land speculation and business development.32
 From the time that an overseas presence was first estab- lished, many of those who left Britain to pursue careers in the  wider world continued to regard metropolitan society as home.  This occurred even in areas where settlement rather than short- term service characterized the British presence, and members  of some colonial societies proved reluctant to redefine notions  of what should be regarded as home. Indeed, this tendency,  which was common among all European colonists, frequently  outlived the original settler and survived for several genera- tions within a family. 39 Not only did this mean that settlers  focused as much emotional and cultural attention on the Old  World as they did on their new surroundings, but when they  had accumulated sufficient resources they sometimes sought  to return whence they came.40 Some West Indian planters,  such as Charles Price of jamaica, never set eyes on Britain, yet  they always regarded it as home. They went to elaborate lengths  to ensure that their dependants were able to use the mother  country as a safe haven to which they could retreat in order to  escape from a debilitating and often insecure existence in the  Caribbean.41
 BELIEF AND LIBERTI: RELIGION AND POLITICS Britons in all overseas communities, but most notably those in  the colonies of the Atlantic empire, were bound together by  their adherence to a set of common religious beliefs and con- stitutional ideals that had been exported from the mother country. English liberty and the Protestant faith provided the  cornerstones of everyday life in all parts of the overseas empire,  and colonists everywhere drew from the same general fund of  religious and political traditions. Protestantism might have  fragmented into a number of different denominations, and  colonial commitment to the preservation of English liberties  might have owed more to misplaced idealism than to constitu- tional reality, but religious and political attachments brought  form and structure to the empire, gave identity to colonists,  and helped to reinforce transoceanic connections and associa- tions.71 Whatever the view of the empire was from the centre,  colonists did not doubt that they were entitled to the full benefit  of English law and constitutional rights, even if there was often  some confusion over precisely which form of legislation and  the law should hold sway in the colonies.72 Rightly or wrongly,  colonists believed that Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights and the  Toleration Act were as applicable to them as to any other  Englishman.
 Denied an effective voice in the British legislature, colonists  instead devoted considerable attention to influencing imperial  decision-making in other ways. From the 1620s, North Ameri- can and West Indian colonies had appointed official agents to  promote their interests in London, and colonial merchants  and religious groups also cultivated metropolitan contacts in a  systematic and well-organized fashion. 75 As members of ex- tended transatlantic communities, merchants and religious  groups were often able to work closely and effectively with like- minded interest groups in Britain, and the system took on a  formal appearance as committees were established to coordin- ate activities and campaigns. In view of the small size of the  colonial lobby within the Commons, agents and interest groups  found it difficult to influence the decisions of Parliament. They  nevertheless ensured that colonial voices were often heard in  the corridors of power, notably those at the Board of Trade  and the Treasury. Americans did not always get what they  wanted when powerful interest groups were ranged against  them, but concessions were made, legislation was altered, and  favourable measures were introduced as a result of lobbying  activity. This was especially the case between 1721 and 1754  when the development of lobbying helped to establish a rela- tionship of mutual benefit between London and the colonies.  Colonial interest groups pressed their claims on ministers and  officials who, in return, made use of colonists' specialist knowl- edge and expertise as they endeavoured to come to terms with the problems of imperial administration and government. This  relationship was later to be recast when the Board of Trade  found its influence diminished as Parliament took a much  closer interest in imperial affairs, but for most of the first half  of the eighteenth century 'colonists cooperated with the Bri- tish government because they were getting what they wanted  out of it. '76 At a practical level, this ensured that colonial  political activity retained an important transatlantic dimension  and, throughout the period, colonists focused considerable  attention on events in London.
 In addition to its transatlantic political and constitutional  framework, the British Atlantic empire was also given defini- tion, if not uniformity, by being a Protestant empire; that is to  say that most of the non-indigenous members of the overseas  societies under British control adhered to Protestantism of  one form or another. Although Protestantism was at this time  characterized by the existence of deep tensions between Dis- senting denominations and the Anglican community in the  English-speaking world, it nevertheless played an important  dual role in the establishment and development of imperial  identity. At one level, it served to highlight one of the funda- mental differences between Britain and her Catholic Euro- pean rivals, and colonists did not need to look far around  them to be reminded of how the liberty and tolerance of the  British empire stood in marked contrast to the Popery of the  Bourbon powers. At a second level, many members of Protes- tant communities within the empire belonged to transoceanic  faiths which had roots well and truly planted in Britain. To  many of their co-religionists in the mother country, the colon- ists were 'brethren beyond the seas'.77
 The churches, chapels and meeting-houses scattered across  British overseas possessions were often, in theory if not in  practice, part of extended religious communities and organ- izations which were regulated and controlled by metropolitan  authorities. Nothing better symbolized these religious ties  between core and periphery than the Anglican Church refus- ing to devolve any of its authority to the colonies. Despite  pressure for the establishment of an American episcopate, the  colonies remained under the ecclesiasticaljurisdiction of the  Bishop of London throughout the period. 7 The situation was  the same in the West Indies where the the Anglican church in Jamaica has been described by one historian as 'no more than  a collection of qualified individuals, representative of a British  institution' .79 Consequently, any colonist seeking to enter An- glican holy orders was obliged to travel across the Atlantic for  ordination. In a North American context this did not happen  often before 1720 when the Church relied upon an English- born priesthood to fill its posts, but thereafter an increasing  number of native-born Americans sailed to London to be re- ceived into holy office. The majority of the 150 or so Americans  to undertake this type of pilgrimage in the years before 1776  came from the Chesapeake and Lower South where the Angli- can Church had become progressively more entrenched dur- ing the first half of the eighteenth century.80 Yet, for all this  display of metropolitan authority and the fact the Anglican  cause had been reinforced by the establishment of the Society  for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts in 1701,  the Church in America was handicapped by the fact that it  lacked unity and organization in the colonies.81 This stood in  marked contrast with the Dissenting faiths, several of which  had assiduously developed connections with the metropolis  and also organized themselves in the colonies through the  establishment of associations and conventions.82
 All the constitutional, political and religious sinews that  bound the overseas empire together were strengthened dur- ing the course of the eighteenth century. The improvements  that were taking place in communications meant that the  channels through which political and religious ideas, informa- tion and instructions flowed between Britain and the colonies  became much more effective. Again, this helped to reduce  colonial feelings of isolation and it helped to integrate the col- onies much more effectively into the wider English-speaking  world. Although the East India Company's servants in India  remained well beyond the control and supervision of the  metropolitan authorities, the situation was different in the  Atlantic empire where the improvement in communications  helped imperial integration and centralized authority. By 1700,  the regularity and speed of Atlantic crossings were such that  royal governors of colonies were no longer permitted to take  important action, such as declaring war, without approval from  London, and colonial legislation was submitted to the metro- politan authorities for review as a matter of administrative routine. 'Government by instruction' provided the formal basis  of core-periphery relations, and the 3124 letters exchanged  between the governors of royal colonies and the Lords ofTrade,  Council of Trade or their secretaries between 1675 and 1737  bear ample testimony to the fact that the government and  administration of the Atlantic Empire had developed within  a context provided by ever-improving communications.83 Of  course, the same processes that centralized imperial authority  also served to establish better connections between opposition  political groups and religious dissenters on both sides of the  Atlantic, and this helped to bring a transoceanic dimension to  the development of ideological and theological discourse in  the English-speaking colonial and imperial world.84
 Because the gentlemanly ideal provided a model for life- styles in the overseas empire, elites in some quarters failed to  develop, or developed only very slowly, their own distinct forms  of cultural and social activity. Instead, they applied metropoli- tan patterns of behaviour to local circumstances and, hence,  despite some very obvious climatic, economic and topographi- cal differences, there was a great deal of similarity between  elite lifestyles in different quarters of the world. A member of  the New England elite would undoubtedly have found much  familiar had he ever travelled to the West Indies or to one of  the major British settlements in India. For, wherever British  control was established, the representatives of authority re- created aspects of metropolitan life in miniature, be it in terms  of clubs, societies, lodges of freemasons or general forms of  social activity. Local administrative and legal institutions were  developed along metropolitan lines in order to help regulate  colonial societies, notably urban societies, in the same way that British towns and provinces were controlled and ordered.  Political institutions were based upon English models, and  assemblies often bore a striking resemblance to Parliament.7
 Of course, members of colonial elites were not all cast in a  perfect mould of the English gentlemen. Indeed, as far as  some contemporary observers were concerned, they could never  become true gentlemen because more often than not they did  not possess the necessary genealogical credentials. In the Car- ibbean, as elsewhere, attempts made by the elite to embrace  the metropolitan gentlemanly ideal were sometimes deemed  to be vulgar and clumsy, and they were treated with scorn and  derision by representatives of polite metropolitan society in  much the same way that provincials in Britain found them- selves held up to ridicule and abuse.8 Moreover, in a few areas  where the general imprint of British culture was very faint,  some elites either modified the gentlemanly ideal to a quite  significant degree to meet the demands of local conditions or,  alternatively, chose to abandon it altogether.9 Thus, it is im- portant that the genteel nature of elite colonial society is not  overstated because local conditions, practical necessity and  economic imperatives meant that codes of conduct and behav- iour developed in metropolitan society simply could not al- ways be applied in areas under British control. The pattern of  everyday life in the West Indies and colonial America was  repeatedly disrupted by warfare, natural disasters and fire in  urban centres, while disease and poor health were serious ever- present problems for the white population.1° Conditions were  in many ways similar in the east. The British population in  India was repeatedly devastated by illness (much of it related to intemperance), and large numbers of Britons died in ser- vice before they could return homeY Life for many of the elite at the periphery was often very  short, but it could also be nasty and brutish as well. Colonial  life, particularly on the frontier, could be very harsh indeed as  the small elite sought to preserve their often tenuous hold on  their property and position. In order to do this, they presided  over brutal and dehumanizing regimes which were designed  to oppress and control vastly superior numbers of slaves or  transitory white labourers. 12 Indeed, some who embraced  metropolitan manners, attitudes and assumptions with some  degree of enthusiasm were at the forefront of those perpetrat- ing acts of violence and oppression in systematic attempts to  protect their position within the population. Those who en- joyed the full benefits of English liberty and legal protection  were not prepared to extend that liberty and protection be- yond their own race, and this was reflected in the harsh nature  of the slave codes drawn up and adhered to by local elites. 13
 Many of the behavioural patterns of this elite were closely  modelled on those practised by the metropolitan gentry and,  although many variants on the gentlemanly theme emerged,  there can be little doubt that the upper echelons of Chesapeake  society represented a relatively sophisticated genteel commu- nity by the early eighteenth century. Many planters, whatever  their origins or lineage, sought to imitate key aspects of the  lifestyle of the metropolitan gentry and this influenced the  long-term development of economic, political, religious and  social relationships within the region.49 The Virginia gentry  became the leaders of their community. They commanded  local armed forces, acted as law interpretation and enforce- ment officers, and exercised political power in the Council.  Indeed, in the political sphere, attention has been drawn to  the homogeneous nature of the group of leaders who domin- ated the affairs of the Virginia House of Burgesses. This group  has been shown to have been dominated by planters who of- ten engaged in other forms of economic activity. Many of them  were connected through family links, and nearly all of them  were of the Anglican faith and of English origin.50
 The Chesapeake elite might not have led an exclusively lei- sured existence, but they nevertheless displayed as deep a  concern about the acquisition of the trappings of wealth and  status as that exercised by any English landed gentleman. In a  domestic context they built 'great houses' which followed many  of the classical conventions of contemporary metropolitan style;  they commissioned coats of arms and purchased luxurious  furnishings from Europe; and they laid out parks and gardens  in the English manner.56 Moreover, social relationships were  defined through an acceptance of metropolitan modes of  behaviour. The gentry ate, drank and entertained in the Eng- lish fashion; they met together in clubs and societies; and they  followed gentlemanly sports and pastimes such as English-style  horse-racing.57 Above all, they practised good manners and  adhered to codes of conduct and honour that at times were  virtuous in the extreme. All of these factors helped to cast elite Chesapeake society in a metropolitan mould and this served to  define the hierarchy in the well-established areas of the re- gion. In no context was this more clearly seen than in religion  where elite adherence to Anglicanism and its rituals of service  helped to reinforce notions of social order and organization. 58
 By 1740, the Virginia gentry dominated their colony but  their position was not cast in stone and it would be wrong to  depict them as belonging to the top tier of an unchanging  ancien regime type of society. A number of modern historians  have skilfully demonstrated that the position and status of the  elite began to be threatened by changes to the economic sys- tem and by the emergence of powerful religious and political  forces. Traditional assumptions about status, hierarchy, per- sonal autonomy and authority were questioned in Virginia,  leading to a crisis of confidence within the elite, while, on a  broader scale, the very nature of the commercial and political  relationship between the colony and Britain was gradually being  recast. This posed some difficult questions for the gentry and,  with one eye on the future, it obliged them to redefine many  of their central social attitudes and ideals.61
 but the New England merchant elite were still able to establish  a genteel lifestyle based upon patterns of behaviour and  expenditure that they believed to be evident in polite British  society. One English observer commented in 1720 that 'a gentle- man from London would almost think himself at home in  Boston .... In the concerns of civil life, as in their dress, tables  and conversation they [the elite] affect to be as much English  as possible. '64 First and foremost, this served to shape the ma- terial life of the elite but, as elsewhere, it acted as a powerful  agent in helping to determine social status and the region's  hierarchy, even though many important aspects of the old pre- commercial socioreligious order remained intact. By the 1760s,  New England had become 'far more demonstrably English  than it had been during the decades immediately after its  establishment', and there can be no doubting the fact that the  emergence of an aggressive, innovative commercial elite had  played a central part in this process. 65
 Elite culture was also defined by adherence to metropolitan  ideas and standards in the lower southern colonies.68 As South  Carolina moved past the initial stage of pioneer settlement, an  elite emerged who drew on English gentry values as they estab- lished their position. Patterns of education reveal that an ever- increasing number of Carolinans chose to send their children  to school in England after 1750. Not only could they receive  training as lawyers and medical practitioners, but it was hoped  that they would also develop the social graces and manners  appropriate for an English gentleman. This attitude began to  change as the colonial period came to an end, but South  Carolina's failure to establish its own educational establish- ments can in part be attributed to the strength of elite commit- ment to metropolitan values and standards. This commitment  was also seen in the way elite lifestyles came to be based upon  a somewhat idealized version of those adopted by the mem- bers of landed society in Britain. As elsewhere, members of  different types of elite, most notably those involved in trade  and commerce, were attracted to landownership, and it has  been argued that there were few southern merchants who did  not seek to channel their commercial profits into purchases of  land. 69 As the South Carolina Gazette noted in 1773, 'Every trades- man is a merchant, every merchant is a gentleman, and every  gentleman is a member of the noblesse. We are a country of  gentry.' 70
 Land purchases often represented an important first step in  the pursuit of the gentlemanly ideal in South Carolina, but others included the building of houses in the English style and  participation in metropolitan forms of leisure activity, which  included watching horse-racing on courses named after York  and Newmarket. 71 The result was the development of a life- style for the elite that was at times both luxurious and extrava- gant, but this was not simply the result of straightforward  imitation. It has been pointed out that other important influ- ences were at work, not least of which was that South Carolina  provided the least healthy environment in North America. Even  the elite faced a precarious existence. Their lifestyles there- fore reflected that life could be short, and consequently their  wealth was often dedicated to conspicuous consumption. As a  result, some sections of the elite resembled a caricature of the  English gentry in which all the less appealing features of the  leisured classes were accentuated. This provided plenty of  ammunition to those such as the influential Methodist preacher  George Whitefield and others who were critical of the materi- alistic nature of southern society, and who argued that the  excesses of the Charles Town elite were far worse than those  evident in London.72 Other members of the elite, however,  displayed many of the characteristics of the most innovative  and enterprising groups in metropolitan society.73 As such,  they became important agents of growth and expansion in the  region.
 Imitation and replication played a similarly important role  in the private sphere, and few of the elite were prepared to  make many concessions to the local climate and conditions.  This tendency had been evident from the time when the gen- try had begun firmly to establish themselves, and the develop- ment of a comfortable lifestyle, together with the need to  reinforce social status, continued to be based upon the impor- tation of an extraordinarily wide range of British goods.82
 7 The End of the English  Empire In all its essential features, the British overseas empire that  developed and expanded during the first half of the eight- eenth century was an extension of the English empire that had  been established during the course of the seventeenth century.  Although, in a formal sense, colonists were now members of a  British empire governed by a British Parliament in the name  of a British sovereign, many of them still perceived themselves  to be Englishmen, carrying English birthrights and belonging  to an English empire. Some commentators and observers  acknowledged the constitutional changes that had taken place  since the Act of Union of 1707, and they chose their words  with care and precision when they wrote and spoke about  themselves and their contemporaries as British and Britons  rather than English and Englishmen. Others used the words  English and British interchangeably, but a large number of  colonists continued to conduct constitutional and political dis- course in terms dictated by membership of an unreconstructed  English empire and polity. 1
 THE CELTIC DIASPORA AND SCOTTISH ENTRY  INTO THE OVERSEAS ELITE Changing patterns of immigration and settlement affected the  ethnic composition of elites in all Britain's overseas colonies  during the course of the eighteenth century. Indeed, by the  1760s overseas elites were no more 'English' than were many  metropolitan elites, and those governing, directing and de- fending the empire at the periphery had developed into  a remarkably diverse and cosmopolitan range of individuals.  In part, this weakening of English cultural hegemony within  the upper echelons of overseas societies occurred because of the  ongoing process of creolization that was taking place in the  colonies. At the same, continued emigration from Britain  ensured that the base of colonial elites was progressively ex- tended during the course of the century before 1775.
 During the early days of settlement, the process of immigra- tion helped to create and renew founding elites in North  America.34 Later on, newcomers could acquire wealth, status  and political power in such a way that they could move quite  rapidly to the highest echelons of colonial society in even long- established regions. A study of 91 Philadelphia merchants  during the third quarter of the eighteenth century has re- vealed, for example, that a third were immigrants. Their pres- ence in the city was reinforced by second- or third-generation  settlers who had been successful enough to carve out a posi- tion for themselves within the city's political and social elite.35
 The use of Welsh was preserved through everyday talk in the  home and, in response to demand from congregations, reli- gious services continued to be conducted in Welsh.67 In addi- tion, many settlers of Welsh origin were to some extent able to  stay in touch with their homeland, and this meant that, like  Scottish settlers, they were connected with a province of the  metropolis and not with the English imperial core. This was  particularly the case with those Baptists and Quakers who, like  Scottish Presbyterians, belonged to religious communities which  had strong roots in the mother country from where a steady  stream of ministers and preachers crossed the ocean to pro- mote spiritual and cultural renewal among the exiles. Other  settlers, especially those who had become well established and  reasonably affluent, came under the metropolitan influence of  the first Cymmrodorion Society. Although the Society was lo- cated in London, and therefore operated in a context one  step removed from the Principality, it nevertheless endeavoured  between 1751 and 1787 to strengthen cultural ties between  Wales and America. In the colonies themselves, the need among  settlers to retain a sense of distinct identity was also met by  organized groups. In Philadelphia, where a few Welsh-language  books were published, the Society of Ancient Britons was es- tablished in 1729 and St David's Day was celebrated at an  annual banquet at The Tun tavern.68 This helped to provide  an important cultural focal point for the sizeable number of  Welsh settlers in the region. That such efforts to sustain Welsh  identity in the colonies met with at least some degree of suc- cess may be inferred from the comment of one observer in  1763 who spoke of the need to anglicize the Pennsylvanian  Germans in order to prevent them 'from becoming a separate  body and using a separate language, like the Welsh' .69
 At one level, these concerns manifested themselves in the  way ministers responded to the Company's attempts to estab- lish a commercial presence off the coast of north-east Borneo. 32
 Adherence to gentlemanly ideals were to continue to shape  the lifestyles of North American elites long after the War for  Independence had come to an end, but political and eco- nomic circumstances during the 1760s caused resistance to  some of the forces promoting anglicization within the colonies.  In particular, wide-ranging government policy initiatives  raised constitutional fears and prompted considerable political  unrest.47 As a result, colonial protests against metropolitan at- tempts to establish a new imperial order were expressed in a  number of different ways, from boycotts of British goods to  attempts to prevent the establishment of an Anglican bishopric  in the colonies. Each form of action weakened the informal  ties that had previously bound the periphery to the core of the  empire, and, at the same time, misunderstanding and suspi- cion ensured the erosion of any lingering sense of common  purpose and identity that might still have existed within the  transoceanic elite. As the colonies moved towards independ- ence during the early 1770s, elites increasingly splintered and  divided along lines determined by loyalty to the Crown and  empire. Events were to demonstrate that broadly similar cul- tural, economic and social outlooks within different elites were  not by themselves enough to prevent political and religious  conflict leading to the dissolution of the North American  empire.

 How was the ‘rule of colonial diVerence’ established in this period of expansion and consolidation? How did white male colonists, traders, set- tlers, or colonial oYcials, or white missionary wives or teachers separate themselves from ‘native’ populations and construct ‘grammars of diVerence’ which would legitimate their right to possess the land and rule over others?6
 which have had a powerful life right into the twenty-Wrst century.While each site of Empire had its own speciWcities, each was locked into an imperial division of labour.
 The missionary movement played a vital part in the attempt to take Christian and British values into the many parts of Empire, to rescue ‘the heathen’ in his or her many guises. Missions, of whatever complexion operated diVerently in diVerent colonial sites. Though they went through signiWcant changes between the late eighteenth century and decolonization, 24 Kale, Fragments of Empire, p. 166.
 In the early nineteenth century missionaries had an uneasy relation with the imperial government and its colonial oYcials. They were often critical of government policies and at odds with colonists. Yet they were also dependent on imperial power for protection and support in their work. This tension was particularly evident in the West Indies where many Nonconformist missionaries became powerfully identiWed with the struggle against slavery.
 for public activity in the empire’.65 This was a diVerent pattern from that of their metropolitan sisters.
 The Kenyan administration was upset by claims made during Selwyn’s trial that beatings were commonplace, and the Governor wrote in protest to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. In the following decade, the Colonial OYce reviewed all criminal cases in Kenya inwhich awhite manwas charged with themurder or serious assault of a black. Despite concern at the Colonial OYce, until the SecondWorldWar, such cases continued to come before the courts and the accused (who in most instances were long-term residents of the colony and therefore familiar with the conventions governing work relations) continued to oVer the defence that such beatings were normal.
 Physical maturity and mental development were widely linked by experts such as Ethel Stoneman. Although growing faster than white children in their early years, she found that puberty predicted a sudden downturn in the advancement of the Moore River children.50 This evidence that racial diVer- ence was exacerbated by sexual maturation conWrmed new theories about the extended period of growing up among white children. According to Stanley Hall, unlike primitive children, civilized youth passed through ‘ado- lescence’ in order to achieve higher order moral and psychosexual develop- ment. If properly guided during these years between childhood and adulthood, white middle-class girls and boys would achieve the higher mental capacities of their race. For those children leaving childhood too abruptly, such as the unWt, delinquent, sexually precocious, or indigenous, advancement could only be limited. Hall concluded that the inherent moral and intellectual immaturity of non-white races predicted their permanent ‘adolescent’ status, thus endorsing white ascendancy and the moral purpose of colonial rule.51 Nineteenth-century imperial discourses of the civilizing mission became modern pragmatism: young white women and men were to emerge as citizens, while indigenous youth were destined to remain adult- children under their direction.
 Protestantmissionaries, Baptists, Congregationalists, Anglicans,Methodists, Moravians, Presbyterians, and more, from Britain, the United States of America, Protestant areas of Europe, and eventually, Britain’s settler col- onies, covered an astonishing area of the globe, wherever successive British governments asserted economic interests. The missions created voluminous archives, and almost all have their chroniclers. The focus of much mission history on institution-building has precluded examination of the social concerns in which women were crucial actors.3 Female missionaries’ lives were usually left to the apologetic faithful. Scholars who have in recent decades conXated the speciWcities of missionary women within consider- ations of gender and colonialism have inspired revisionist studies from historians who similarly place missions at the intersection of post-colonial and feminist questions.

 The late eighteenth-and early nineteenth-century evangelical revivals in Britain and the United States of America inspired the intensiWed thrust of Protestant mission to non-Western peoples. This impulse in Britain was fuelled by the expansion of the Empire with the industrial revolution and in the United States intensiWed with the conviction that their new country would bring egalitarianism, republicanism, and prosperity to heathen peoples.5 The history of gender and missions cannot be well understood without consideration of the continuing interactions between the mission- ary bodies and the mission-minded public of Britain and other northern countries and missionaries in the Weld. Metropole and colonies shared ideas on the duties of Western to non-Western peoples, as information, know- ledge, and advice Xowed between these locales. The direction the missions took, their recruitment of missionaries, their ideologies and key objectives on gender and family life intertwined closely with news from those abroad 4 For works that engage with gender and missions, see Fiona Bowie and Deborah Kirkwood, eds., Women and Missions: Past and Present: Anthropological and Historical Perceptions (Oxford, 1993); Ruth Compton Brouwer, New Women for God: Canadian Presbyterian Women and India Missions, 1876–1914 (Toronto, 1990); Diane Langmore, Missionary Lives: Papua 1874–1914

In 1921 Lizzie McRae deWantly informed the Board that ‘through Miss Hetherington we have seen and been taughtmore about Jesus, than ever anyManager and his wife on the Aboriginal Reserves in this State or any other could teach us’.23 All dissidents were ordered to attend the regular church services run by white clergy, or leave. Aboriginal resistance to such domination persisted.
 Throughout the twentieth century, Australian Aborigines faced appalling disruption to their family lives, although conversely the period also saw the commencement of indigenous campaigns in the public arena to win back control over their own lives. That dual edge to Christian humanitarianism, its concern for rights and its conviction that assimilation would bring rewards, showed its face again. As some Australians from the 1930s mounted campaigns to oVer restitution for the losses Aborigines had suVered in the Wrst century and a half of contact, certain missionaries were among the small group of people of settler descent who took up the Aborigines’ cause as a pressing human and civil rights issue. Among the Aborigines who came forward in that decade to organize welfare and rights lobby groups, mission- educated people were to the fore, but hereon the story of the missions becomes Australian rather than imperial history.

 According to the Brief State, the Quakers conducted "political Intrigues, under the Mask of Religion."22 From this base of partial truth, which could have applied equally well to all the religious denominations, Smith launched his Brief State into a stratosphere of fabrication. The Quakers had taken "into their pay," he claimed, the German printer named Sauer who was once one of the French prophets in Germany, and is shrewdly suspected to be a Popish emissary." The shrewdness of this suspicion was entirely Smith's. It was well-known in the colony that Sauer was an Anabaptist, further distant from Catholicism than Smith's Church of England.
 Latitudinarianism in its practical rather than ideological aspect was a lay phenomenon. And thus far we have been concerned with the lay dimensions of religion in early Virginia. But there is still a third dimension to be considered: the character of the purveyor of the Christian systemthe Anglican priest, the "dissenting" minister, the Quaker "Minister of Truth." For convenience call the type, regardless of persuasion, simply "minister." Much ink has been used to point up the theological distinctions among the ministers of the seventeenth centuryall to very good purpose, I add. But here let me make the point of their essential similarity.
 commemorate the Last Supperto cite two extremesthe Christian institution functioned socially in much the same way. 40 That it should do so was an element of the cultural baggage carried to Virginia, and it is for this reason that I have referred to the people's "expectation" that religion would play an enormous social role. The social functioning of the Virginia church was not, as it developed, exactly the same as that of its English parent, certainly; neither was it the only implement for fulfilling such social tasks, for church and Sabbath day on the one hand, and County Court and Court day on the other, shared much the same set of social functions. But that is another story. The point here is that, again, we are faced with an imperative in the evolution of early Virginia's religion: the church was expected to perform a social function, and, as in England, the social function expected of the religious institution was not related to the particular Christian subset preached from the pulpit. In brief, it did not matter in Virginia whether the incumbent conformed to the canons and constitutions of the church in England or deviated from those canons, provided that the church, as it in large measure inevitably did, performed its social role. Even the Quaker "church" did so, as is evidenced by the records of the Chuckatuck Monthly Meeting, established in Nansemond in 1672 and flourishing at century's end. Its record book is little different from, say, the parish book of Middlesex's Christ Church or Gloucester's Petswortha record of care for the poor, for widows, for children; of moral and marketplace discipline; of the community's births, marriages, and deaths; of recognition of social status by the admission into the offices of the meeting of the community's preeminent men.41
 The two dimensions outlinedthe thirst for an ordering of the unknown on the one hand and the expectation that the Christian institution play a particular social roleoffer us a setting for the evolution of religion in Virginia, one far more complex than the simple citation of the law, "Ordered, That there be a uniformitie throughout this colony . . . to the canons and constitutions of the church of England,"42 would imply, and the assertion of an Anglican transplantation and sea-change can explain. Seventeenth-century Virginia was a colony where magic rubbed shoulders with Christianity; where "honest, able, sober, pious, and orthodox ministers" were solicited from London, and "Anythingarians" were accepted into parish pulpits; where men and women, in the absence of Page 218
 In still another sense, the Christian institution affirms the society by adjusting its internal hierarchy to that of the society at large. For example, not just anybody took a seat on the governing board of a Virginia parish: on the contrary, as an intensive study of one well-functioning parish clearly shows, an invitation to join the vestry followed as night the day the achievement of high economic status within the community. Thus the religious institution, in effect, was used to signify the "arrival" of a new community leader.38 Neither did one sit just anywhere within a Virginia church or chapel, as Mistress Jones of Christ Church Parish, Middlesex, quickly learned. As the housekeeper and perhaps mistress of Colonel Christopher Wormeley, a position which in her eyes raised her status, she attempted to sit "above her Degree," only to be bodily ''displaced" by the churchwarden, a displacement which was fully approved by the vestry. Richard Price of St. Mary White Chapel in nearby Lancaster learned a similar lesson. For his "rude irreligous & uncivill" intrusion "into the seat purposely designed & made use off by his Majesties Justices of the Peace," in the course of which he "did rudely force backwards upon his seate" the high sheriff of the county, Price was dispatched by Lancaster's gentlemen justices to Jamestown and the governor for judgment and punishment. To the justices the whole affair tended "to the dishonor of God Almighty, the contempt of his Majesty and ministers, offience of the congregation, scandall to religion & evill example of others."39
 In none of this, of course, were the Virginians particularly unique. In any consideration of the English church, and of the English parish in particular, one must be impressed by the large and multifaceted social role it played. Moreover, and a more important point, it played this role regardless of the particulars of doctrine and ceremony preached and exercised under its cover. Whether a Catholic populace crowded the church to impart a magical significance to the miracle of transubstantiation, or solemn Puritans gathered around a kitchen table to Page 213
 We need not pause long to document the familiar facts of Virginia's religious history. Virginia's laws clearly and constantly stipulated that the colony was to be Anglican, that there was to be "an uniformity in our church as neere as may be to the canons in England," that for the preservation of the purity of doctrine and the unity of the church all ministers were to conform to the orders and constitutions of the church in England, that nothing be taught except that by the canons appointed and inserted into the Book of Common Prayer. 28 Yet the Virginians clearly and constantly demonstrated that they were far less particular than their laws would suggest, for when any ostensible man of God presented himself, they seem to have been quick to put him in a pulpit.
 At mid-seventeenth century, Nansemond County Virginians, despairing of attracting ministers, sent away to New Englanda veritable nursery of men of Godand while those who responded to the call were soon sent packing by the government at Jamestown, there were others in the colony of roughly Puritan persuasion: masters Thomas Harrison and William Durand of Lower Norfolk County, certainly; Charles Grymes of York County, in all probability; Daniel Richardson of Hungars Parish, Northampton, and later Settingbourne Parish, Rappahannock; Francis Doughty of Hungars. In 1677 the Bishop of London knew of the state of affairs and complained to the Committee for Trade and Plantations that the laws of the colony were not being duly executed and that "persons" were being allowed "to exercise the Ministry without proofe that they are in [Anglican] orders."29 In the 1680s, Presbyterian-types James Porter, Josias Makie, and Andrew Jackson were all incumbent ministers of ostensibly Anglican parishes.30 Traveling Quakers were receivedthe "public,'' proselytizing Friendsand where they passed Quaker meetings sprang up.31 Historians working in the context of the orderly, denominational Christianity that was to develop have tended to read back into this farrago to accent the particular persuasions, talking of an Anglican Virginia and of dissenting Puritans, Presbyterians, Quakers. We are, however, closer to understanding the early Virginians when we envision them as being of no particular persuasion at all, but instead as merely responding to any man who offered a systematic bridge to the transcendental. At least on the lower socioeconomic levels they were like Thomas' elderly Londoner who conceived of his soul as a great bone, or the ignorant lad on the moor. In some measure, at least, this was their Page 214
 In one sense this affirmation involves simply the use of the religious institution to serve particular social purposes, the purpose, in the process, being both accomplished and "sacralized" or hallowed. Most obvious, of course, is the hallowing of family formation via marriage; less obvious is a whole array of social responsibilities devolving upon the church. In law and practice in Virginia, for example, we note society utilizing the parish to care for its orphaned and bastard children and for its poor: Mary Clay, "a poore Indigent woman" and widow, was maintained by Christ Church Parish, Middlesex County, for twenty-three years, and the same parish regularly expended between a fifth and a Page 211
 Throughout the literature on religion in the Old Dominion, the planting of the Anglican church and a Virginia colony are held to constitute a single event. True enough, there was a desultory Puritanism in the very earliest years, perhaps even, as Perry Miller described it, a brief cycle of "religious dedication, disillusionment, and then reconciliation to a world in which making a living was the ultimate reality" to mirror the longer and stronger cycle Miller envisioned for New England. 3 But thereafter it was a question of the central government asserting an Anglican orthodoxy in legal statutes and of the Virginia gentlemen, in their vestries, molding the establishment to their peculiar American condition. Daniel Boorstin, for example, was echoing traditional scholarship when he wrote of the church of "The Transplanters": "The Church of England, in becoming the Church of Virginia, had not altered its theology one iota, [but] it had undergone a sea-change in institutions."4 A bishops' church without bishops led inevitably through fights over induction and presentment, glebe rights and salaries, to the gentlemanly parish of the eighteenth century. One shifts without change from scholar to scholarfrom Boorstin to Ahlstrom, from Ahlstrom back to Bruce, from Bruce to Goodwin to Brydon, from Brydon to Seiler: The harsh conditions imposed by a foreign and hostile environment, geographical separation from the mother country, and the absence of a competent episcopal form of organization led the colonists to apply their own distinctive modifications to the structure and operation of the church in Virginia. In the absence of direct English control a colonial control was substituted. The Assembly, the governor, and, most important in the development of local self-government, the parish vestry, assumed essential roles in the emergence of the Anglican Church in Virginia.5
 Jefferson's impiety stemmed from both classicism and science. In his youth he drifted away from the established church in Virginia and subscribed to a typically eighteenth-century version of natural religion. This fueled his long campaign for disestablishment, topped off in 1786 by the enactment of his remarkable Statute for Religious Freedom. The far-reaching principles of the statute (absolute freedom of religious conscience and entire separation of church and state) were dictated neither by the circumstances of American society nor by the revolutionary ideology of republicanism. To be sure, the social environment was favorable, but it was the power of ideas that finally captured the environment for the principles. In Europe, where the last of the philosophes hailed the Virginia achievement, none ever went so far as to advocate the dissolution of the ties between church and state. European liberals were Page 233

 But this ministerial mind imposed itself at a cost paid in the eighteenth century. In part, the coin paid was the encouragement of nascent denominationalism and pluralism, for as the century progressed, enough of a recognizable Anglican orthodoxy appeared to deter Presbyterianand Baptisttypes from adhering (as they had through the seventeenth century). And barred from this emerging orthodoxy, men and women of such persuasions necessarily sought identification with other emerging orthodoxiesa small group from Hanover County, for example, determining "that Luther was a noted Reformer, and that his book had been of special use to us," declaring themselves Lutherans, then discovering a copy of the Confessions of Faith of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland and accepting the designation Presbyterian.61 In part, too, however, the coin was the surrender to lay latitudinarianism and the acceptance of the church as primarily a social institution. The laymen wanted no "scholars and stoicks, or zealots too rigid in outward appearance," no "quarrelsom and litigious ministers, who would differ with their parishioners about insignificant trifles." And they got none. The best of Virginia's parsons came to accept "the Practical Part of Religion'' as "the Chief part of our Pastoral Care;" the worst mumbled a quick, formal sermon to the cushion, then went off to dine with the local squire.62 Yet the lay latitudinarianism to which the ministers surrendered was not, recall, spread equally through the society. Under the aegis of a distant God and social church a gentry-oriented society could and did flourish, largely indifferent to the deeper aspects of its own creation, nurturing here and there a Jeffersonian rationalism. But for those less comfortable in society, more anxiety proneperhaps a growing number, if we accept the thrust of recent social historians63the social church offered little. Eighteenth-century evangelicalism, speaking more to psychological needs than did Virginia's polite Anglicanismwould find its converts largely among these.64 With that, it seems, we come full circle. For having started with religion in the era of the Revolutionwith rationalism, evangelicalism, formalism, and indifferenceour exploration of the antecedent evolution in the religious life of Virginia returns us to the same place.
 of the Gospel"; the second by soliciting an order requiring the ouster of all ministers not properly in episcopal orders; the third by the payment of the ministry out of quitrents rather than parish levies. Memorials to the crown and civil authorities of the colony were prepared to effect these reforms. But the most important work was the organization of an "Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction" in Virginia which would effect "a speedy Reformation of the lives of both Clergy and Laity." ''The Ecclesiastical laws against all cursers Swearers & blasphemers, all whoremongers fornicators and Adulterers, all drunkards ranters and profaners of the Lords day and Contemners of the Sacraments" were to be revived "and put in execution," and, with the consent of the meeting, Blair appointed four "Substituts and Surrogats" to "exercise the Ecclesiastical jurisdiction" within the various "precincts" of Virginia. Twice a year the surrogates, with the whole clergy of their precincts, were to hold court, while an annual "General meeting" at Jamestown was to act as a superior court for "difficult and intricat" cases. Blair's own periodic visitations of the parishes would complete the system. 54 Quite clearly the ministers intended to establish a structure which could define and enforce an Anglican orthodoxy.
 The Anglican effort of 1690 failed of its immediate purpose. Blair subsequently sped for England to solicit quitrent money for both college and clergy, and while he was successful in obtaining royal funds for the college and his own salary, his attempts to collect the monies in Virginia ran afoul of the necessity to spend monies for defense.55 The ecclesiastical court structure was no sooner set up in 1691 than it was struck down, Blair's surrogate, Master Samuel Eburne, being summoned before the Governor and Council to acknowledge the error of such ways.56 And while the Governor and Council, in response to the ministers, once more ordered that no parish "entertain any minister . . . who doth not in all things comply with the Canons of the Church of England," the vestry of Christchurch Parish, Lancaster, as late as 1704, would report that it was well satisfied with Master Andrew Jackson, "although not Quallified with Episcopall Orders."57 For our purposes, however, the fact of immediate failure is less important than the fact of the attempt itself, exemplifying as it does the ministerial dimension of Virginia's religious course.
 And the ministerial mind (of the Anglican persuasion), over time and by the weight of numbers and perseverance, did indeed impose the appearance of Anglican form upon the churches. Christchurch, Lancaster, although loyally supporting Master Jackson in 1704, was clearly apologetic about his deviation from an emerging norm. They would, the vestrymen wrote, "upon removall of our present Minister . . . embrace it as a Singuler blessing of heaven both upon our Selves and posterity to be Supplied with another good one in his room whose Conversation as well as Doctrine may becom his Character." The same year Gloucester's Petsworth vestry made a point of hearing their minister, Emanuel Jones, "read Common Prayer . . . both in the forenoon & afternoon . . . according to the form and order prescribed & Directed by the book entituled the book of Comon prayer & administration of the Sacraments," noting that "immediately after reading the Same [he] made a Page 220
 Anglican form could only be purveyed by ministerial minds of Anglican persuasion. And through much of the seventeenth century the Anglican ministry in Virginia suffered from both the paucity of its ministers and their isolationan isolation in part physical and induced by the scattered nature of Virginia's population, but in part institutional in the sense that the very form they espoused denied the ministers a corporate identity apart from an episcopal structure they did not have.51 As a consequence there was little to be done in defense of form except complain against its absence, as Goodwyn did, and Roger Green,52 or to work quietly on behalf of form within particular parishes.
 In the 1670s and 1680s, however, the number of ministers in Virginia tripled, the new arrivals coming directly from England and reflecting the strong church position of the English Anglican revival.53 And in 1689 episcopal authority of a sort arrived in the person of Master James Blair, newly appointed commissionary of the Bishop of London. Under his aegis the orthodox Anglican clergy met at Jamestown and considered at length the dearth of qualified candidates for Virginia's pulpits, the number of unorthodox ministers occupying many of those pulpits, and the dependence of the ministry on the lay vestries. The first problem, they agreed, was to be solved by the erection of a college "to the end that the Church of Virginia may be furnish'd with a Seminary of Ministers Page 141
 from established ways. The central impulse of their city on a hill was to convert that revolutionary fervor into the service of society. The central problem of their errand was to transform the fierce individualistic energies unleashed by the Reformation into a mode of cultural cohesion and continuity.
 ordinarily liberal provision for religious liberty, but not including Jay's proposal for excluding those Catholics who would not publicly abjure the authority of the Pope, was Jay's handwork. 15
 Bercovitch is concerned with American cultural history and the ways the Revolutionary generation was joined to both the seventeenth-century Puritans and twentieth-century Americans celebrating the bicentennial of the Revolution. In his essay, "Puritanism in a Revolutionary World," delivered in the fall of 1976, Bercovitch links the famous sermon of Puritan Samuel Danforth concerning the Puritans' "errand into the wilderness" and bicentennial responses such as that of President Gerald Ford delivered at Valley Forge earlier that year commemorating "the first fourth of July'' as similar attempts to transform the "fierce individualistic energies unleashed by the Reformation into a mode of cultural cohesion and continuity." Since the Revolution, Christianity has been invoked to provide both a mythical reconstruction of our national history and the rationale for a sense of American identity and mission. Bercovitch argues that in their attempts to define the American tradition both the Founding Fathers and the writers of the mid-nineteenth-century "American Renaissance" began by distinguishing themselves from the decadent Europeans, drawing a line between "rebellion" and "revolution."

 While Stone is primarily focused on England, his general argument relates to the Anglo-American world. The colonial elite, especially as the century wore on, mimicked the English gentry with sometimes similarly absurd results. More generally, the colonial family was a variant of the English family and, in the same way, religion in the colonies must be seen as a variant of English religious life. Darrett B. Rutman's essay, "The Evolution of Religious Life in Early Virginia," sharply qualifies the common view of the colonies as far more religious than modern America and colonial Virginia as a stronghold of Anglican orthodoxy. According to conventional wisdom, the Church of England was simply transplanted to colonial Virginia where, despite minor organizational and institutional changes, it flourished in complete doctrinal purity as the Church of Virginia until the Revolution. Instead, Rutman argues that to understand the evolution of religion in the colonies, historians must explore two underlying dimensions: "the thirst for an ordering of the unknown on the one hand and the expectation that the Christian institution will play a particular social role." In relation to the first dimension, Rutman demonstrates that witchcraft was transplanted to Virginia along with the Anglican creed and argues that the Devil and his disciples were every bit as real to some of Virginia's ostensibly skeptical Anglicans as to the superstitious Puritans of Salem. In early Virginia, "magic and Christianity were, in a very real sense, competitive systems." Here, following the work of English scholars and the current fascination with popular spirituality, he emphasizes that "the cultural milieu from which the Virginians emerged was not monolithically Christian . . . [but that] Christianity . . . was in the process of diffusion through the culture rather than a pervasive feature of it." Even within the world of the colonial churches there were extensive alterations in and violations of Anglican dogma, dictated by "basic psychological and social needs" far more compelling than "the tenets of any particular creed." This led to competition between traditional Anglicans and the upstart sects such as the Quakers and later the Presbyterians and the Baptists. Colonial Virginians proved entirely willing to turn to the "upstart denominations" which met certain purely social rather than spiritual requirements.
 Finally, the social function of the church served to reinforce what in New England was called ''the standing order" and to create potential centers of protest against it. The churches, through the vestry, controlled the secular lives of the people in Virginia's counties and, along with the county courts, provided local government in the Old Dominion. There was an overlapping of vestry members and justices; when the Revolution came, it involved both the conflict between the Burgesses and the Crown and a challenge to the local gentry's control of the colony posed by the evangelical churches and their followers. In order to understand the Revolution, we must appreciate the combination of "rationalism, evangelicalism, formalism, and indifference" that was a byproduct of the "evolution of the religious life of Virginia" and the other colonies of British North America.
 Whilst loyt’ring Hinds Lurke here at home, with shame.
 Such sentiments, in various forms, had been the staple of a handful of colonial propagandists for the past thirty years. The most persuasive had been Richard Hakluyt, an Oxford graduate, whose purpose had been to awaken his countrymen to what he considered their divinely ordained national duty as colonisers. His Principal Navigations, first published in 1598, was an extensive recital of all the voyages undertaken by Englishmen and was intended to demonstrate the existence of a long and noble tradition of overseas enterprise. By revealing what had been achieved in the past, Hakluyt hoped to enkindle in his contemporaries a sense of destiny which would impel them to found colonies and penetrate distant oceans in search of trade.
 Hakluyt’s vision of an expansionist England accorded with the aggressive policies of an influential group of courtiers and councillors, including the Earl of Leicester, Sir Francis Walsingham and Raleigh, all Hispanophobes and passionate anti-Catholics. They were willing to support colonisation projects as a means of damaging Spain and, in the case of a 1580 scheme for a settlement of Newfoundland, as a way of removing potentially subversive Catholics from England. None of these plans came to anything; the minute and under-funded settlements placed on Roanoke Island and Newfoundland during the 1580s soon withered.
 By 1660 the largely Puritan New England settlements had a population of about 30,000, many of whom were refugees who had challenged and then fled from the rigid orthodoxy of the first, coastal colonies. Theological wrangling was endemic among Puritans and it caused fragmentation as deviant preachers left communities which found their opinions intolerable. Roger Williams, a young divine who like John Milton had learned his Puritanism at Cambridge, arrived in New England in 1631. His doctrinal radicalism, which led him to deny the legal right of James I and Charles I to give away Indian lands to his fellow settlers, caused his voluntary exile in 1636. With a handful of his adherents he founded a new colony, Rhode Island, where he was later joined by other banished heretics.
 Plans to rid England of another body of religious dissidents, Catholics, had been considered since the early 1570s. Excluded from Virginia, English Catholics finally gained a colony when Lord Baltimore persuaded a sympathetic Charles I to issue him a charter in 1634. The new settlement was named Maryland, in honour of Charles’s queen Henrietta Maria, and its colonists were officially cautioned to hold their masses discreetly for fear that they might antagonise their Protestant neighbours.
 This is not to say that America was democratic. Personal wealth was the yardstick of social position, as it was in Britain, and men of property played a key part in the daily ordering of their communities by serving as magistrates and county sheriffs. They could and did sometimes demand the kind of deference which was found in Britain. When a Baptist interrupted an Anglican service in a Virginian church with impromptu psalm-singing in 1771, he was ejected and whipped by the vicar for his impertinence, and later given a further flogging by the local sheriff, a ‘gentleman’.8 And yet the Church of England, the spiritual backbone of British Toryism, had made little headway in North America where Nonconformists predominated. As a result, a New York Anglican parson regretted that few Americans upheld ‘the principles of submission and obedience to lawful authority’ which lay at the heart of his church’s doctrine.9
 Of probably greater importance than the extension of parliamentary control over the Indian empire was a fundamental change in attitude of that generation of young Company servants who were taking up their posts at the turn of the century. They arrived having been exposed to evangelicalism, a creed which was making considerable headway among the British middle and upper classes during the 1780s and 1790s. Evangelicalism was a form of Protestantism which emphasised personal spiritual regeneration through the acceptance of Providence, and useful service to mankind, undertaken in accordance with Christian humanitarian principles. Cornwallis seems to have been one of the first to have been swayed by evangelical ideals for, on his appointment as governor-general, he listed his priorities as: ‘Try to be of some use; serve your country and your friends [and] take the means which God is willing to place in your hands.’21
 In the same year, a book was published which reviewed the development of New South Wales. Its anonymous author listed many encouraging signs of future prosperity: the settlement’s growth rate seemed to surpass that of the former American colonies and one recent innovation, a local newspaper (the Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser), was seen as a milestone on the road to maturity. The Australians, he noted approvingly, were trying to find a ‘national character’ though nothing was said about its ingredients.17 This silence is understandable, for there appeared to be little cohesion among the 8,000 or so colonists, many, perhaps the majority of whom had no wish to be there. They represented what their descendants would call the ‘us’ who were watched over, controlled and judged by the ‘them’, that smaller body of administrators, soldiers and free landowners. Unlike America, where common bonds of religion or an urge for self-advancement had given a sense of purpose to the first colonists, early Australia was a divided society. In any case, it would have been hard for religion to have had much impact on men and women with a proven immunity to sermons. Moreover, the fact that during the early days colonial chaplains were Anglicans, who preached obedience to the secular authorities, which they often served as magistrates, made it well nigh impossible for them to have any moral influence over the convicts. There were, as elsewhere in the empire, public displays of loyalty to Britain, celebrated by the rituals of toasts to the king and balls on royal anniversaries. But this attachment to a country which oppressed their homeland and sent them into exile meant nothing to the growing body of Irish convicts, who would bequeath their ancestral grudges to their children and grandchildren.
 There were, however, profound differences of opinion as to whether the Maoris and other races possessed a ‘better nature’, and how it could be cultivated. On one side there were the pragmatists, who were for the most part soldiers, sailors and administrators (often former servicemen), colonists and their adherents in Britain who were sceptical about the capacity of native peoples for advancement. On the other hand there was a powerful body of Christian philanthropists who believed that these races could be raised to standards of education and conduct which would place them alongside Europeans. Members of this group tended to be Nonconformists, middle-class, and Liberal or Radical in their politics. Their opponents were largely Anglicans with aristocratic or gentry backgrounds and Whig or Tory sympathies, although this was a period when party labels mattered far less than they did later.

 XVIII The Tropical Colonies under the Impact of XIX Reform and Expansion in India 327
 The national character of the colonial empire was fundamentally altered by the Revolution. Now it contained practically an equal number of French and English settlers. Here lies the problem, which began with the acquisition of Canada by the treaty of 1763. Hitherto the empire had grown gradually by more or less peaceful expansion and the settlement of Englishmen overseas. An occasional conquest had added a foreign colony, such as Dutch New York and French Acadia; but it had always been a young and small one, to which the conqueror had been able to give an English character. When Britain conquered Canada, it was already an old colony, only one year younger than Virginia, her oldest; it was a big one, with a European popula- tion of some 65,000; and it was utterly alien in language, religion, laws, political institutions, and culture. Never had the empire swal- lowed anything like this. How could it be assimilated? The problem was so foreign to British experience that officials in London could not grasp it when they approached the task of providing for the administration of the newly conquered colony. They were also blinded by two expectations that, if realized, would have obviated the necessity of facing the problem. They had grounds, not wholly unrea- sonable, for believing that Canada might soon lose its French character and its Roman Catholic religion. The migration of New Englanders was changing the face of things in Nova Scotia, and London looked for a much larger movement of surplus population, English-speaking and Protestant, from the old colonies into Canada. Then too, the Catholic Church in Canada was without a head, its bishop having died on the eve of the French surrender; and without a bishop to ordain priests the church might die with its clergy. Moreover, reports from the St. Lawrence confidently asserted that the people might easily be converted. So the British government proceeded to deal with Canada on the assumption that it would conform to the traditional pattern of an English colony.
 The fright that Ireland had again given England, and the nightmare of terror from which Irish Protestants had just recovered, inspired a grim determination to crush Catholic Ireland forever; to this end, law was piled upon law during the next half generation. The Roman Catholics, who formed at least three quarters of the population, were deprived of all civil rights, their property was confiscated, their educa- tion was proscribed, and their clergy were outlawed. These penal laws were almost as monstrous as the measures that had recently harried the Huguenots out of France. Catholic Ireland was so prostrate that it did not stir during the rest of England's long struggle against Louis XIV or her wars with France in the middle of the eighteenth century. Even Irish Protestants suffered, though much less severely, from legislation passed by the newly sovereign parliament in London, under the influence of Anglican religious intolerance and English commer- cial jealousy. It excluded from every public office the loyal Presby- terians of Ulster, who were reinforced by immigration from Scotland until they perhaps equalled in number the Episcopalian Protestants in Ireland; and it forbade the export of Irish woolen goods to any country except England, which had earlier imposed prohibitive duties upon them. Irish landowners, mostly members of the established church, when hit by the closing of the English market to their livestock and meat, had turned to the production and manufacture of wool on a large scale, which profitable business was now strangled. The only prosperous part of Ireland was Protestant Ulster, the home of the linen industry, which England encouraged, having practically none of her own. The rest of the country was in a deplorable state, and the economic plight of the Irish peasants was the worst of all.
 One was organized agrarian violence, which then had no religious or political motive but was simply the blind outburst of a wretched peasantry against the extension of pasture land and the exactions of the tithe collectors. Bands of men, often several hundred strong, marched around, usually by night, destroying enclosures, cutting up grass lands, killing or maiming cattle, burning houses, breaking open jails where their fellows were incarcerated, and otherwise practicing intimidation, but generally stopping short of murder, a crime their nineteenth century successors frequently committed. Catholic priests opposed the outbreaks, and in the North they were chiefly the work of Protestant tillers of the soil. These disturbances were pretty well sup- pressed before the American revolt began. The other movement was purely political and Protestant. Even so, it sought to embrace Roman Catholics rather than to oppress them. Its object was to emancipate the country from English control, to make Ireland a self-governing dominion; and the seat of the movement was the Irish parliament, the preserve of the Protestant minority who belonged to the established church. The fear of a Catholic uprising, which had made their grandfathers feel the need of English supremacy, was dying out. Since the beginning of the century, the subject race "had done nothing more dangerous than endure wrong." The local atmosphere of security and the general spirit of the age encouraged the growth of religious tolerance or indifference, and the penal laws that were most iniquitous had fallen into desuetude. The Catholic popu- lation, once regarded as steeped in disloyalty, was now free of that taint. The Catholic clergy were no longer molested, the Catholic townsfolk were quite a respectable body, and the surviving Catholic gentry and nobility were coming out of retirement to attest their attachment to the Crown, When this relaxation of tension between religions had undermined the ruling oligarchy's reliance on English supremacy, a new influence made that oligarchy wish to throw off the English yoke. Their en- trenched position was endangered by George III, who, having broken the power of the Whigs at home, was anxious to do the same to the little group who ran the government of Ireland by monopolizing the spoils of office and controlling a majority of the three hundred seats in the Dublin House of Commons. The lord lieutenant, who repre- sented the king in Ireland, had been little more than a figurehead, visiting Ireland only for the sessions of parliament, held once in two years. Now he was required to reside there during his term of office, to take the business of patronage out of the hands of the Undertakers, as they were called because they had "undertaken" to manage parlia- ment, and to manage the government himself under direction from London. Thus the problem of imperial control was coming to a head in Ireland at the same time as in the American colonies. The American Revolution had a profound effect upon Ireland. Yet there it produced no sign of a revolutionary uprising, even among the Presbyterians in Ulster, who were "fiercely American." The Catholics were never quieter; their principal noblemen responded eagerly to a government request for aid in raising troops, the old ban on Catholic enlistments having been ignored for many years; and their gentry seized the occasion to present addresses of loyalty condemning the violence of the Americans. The Anglican minority, however, were far from unanimous in backing British authority in America, for many of them realized that the American cause was theirs too. Still they would use only constitutional means to get rid of British authority in Ireland.
 This large unofficial military force, which had virtual control of the country, inevitably became also a political organization, to whose demands London was obliged to bow. That was why an Irish bill was passed to relieve Protestant dissenters from the Anglican sacramental test for office and allowed to become law in 1780, almost half a cen- tury before their coreligionists in England got political equality with members of the established church. By 1780, also, the British govern- ment passed legislation which, though not establishing free trade be- tween the two countries, gave Ireland equal rights with Britain in imperial and foreign trade and without requiring anything in return.
 the disturbance and the repression were much more violent, the conflict inflamed racial and religious passions that had long been dying down, and the awakening nation lost even the symbol of its independence. The spirit of the French Revolution entered Ireland in Ulster, a province of strange contradictions and explosive elements. There the American Revolution had roused much sympathy for the colonial cause and not a little republican feeling, and then had given rise to the main movement of the loyal Volunteers, many of whom, now Catholic as well as Protestant, were still under arms, the government having shrunk from the danger of attempting to dissolve them. There, too, some Protestants were now fighting with Roman Catholics while other Protestants were reaching out for political union with them. This fighting, which began in 1785 and seems to have originated in a pri- vate quarrel that had no religious flavor, was between bands of Peep-o'- Day Boys, mostly Presbyterians, who terrorized Catholic peasants by bursting into their cottages in the early hours of the morning to search for and seize illegally possessed arms, and bands of Defenders, Catholic peasants organized professedly to check such outrages. Furious as was the hatred on both sides of this sporadic rural strife among the poorest classes, it did not infect their betters. They were inoculated against it in that age of "enlightenment," and they realized that they had com- mon interests that should draw them together. The compulsory pay- ment of the tithe to support the Anglican Church was as objectionable to Presbyterians as it was to Roman Catholics, and so was the political monopoly of the ruling clique. Though the Roman Catholic leaders were still shy about demanding emancipation, they were encouraged by the politically-minded Presbyterians, who were not at all shy. They were more than ever impatient for the reform of parliament, but saw little chance of getting it except in alliance with the Roman Catholics and on equal terms with them. Great was the encouragement that came from Paris in the news that the French had abolished all religious disqualifications and the whole tithe system, and the revolutionary example of France awakened ominous echoes in the north of Ireland.
 In July 1791, the second anniversary of the taking of the Bastille was the occasion of a great celebration in Belfast. Democratic toasts were downed with enthusiasm, an address of fulsome flattery was sent to France, a resolution in favor of religious equality was passed by Presbyterian Volunteers, and Catholic bodies formally returned their warmest thanks. In September, a startling pamphlet appeared and gained wide circulation. It summoned the whole nation to unite in demanding a parliament that would truly represent it and redress all Irish grievances. The author was Wolfe Tone, an able young lawyer of Dublin, a nominal Presbyterian and a real free thinker. In October, at Belfast, he launched the Society of United Irishmen, which soon had branch organizations in every part of Protestant Ulster. Its original purpose was to combine Protestants and Roman Catholics in such a powerful political organization that it would compel parliament to reform itself in accordance with tie national will. Before long, how- ever, despair of achieving this end by constitutional methods, and the contagious example of France, began to drive the movement along the road that Tone wanted it to follow, toward the establishment of an independent Irish republic by armed rebellion supported by a French invasion; Catholic Ireland was repelled rather than attracted by the French Revolution, which confiscated all church property and essayed to re- organize the church as a democratically governed national institution having no ties with Rome. This being so, it is not surprising that the United Irishmen won scarcely any Catholic recruits until 1795, a fateful year in Irish history. Nevertheless, there was meanwhile a growing ferment among the Catholics. Defenderism was spreading to other parts of Ireland and it was changing in character, becoming an organized anarchic movement of desperate poverty-stricken peasants who knew nothing and cared nothing about politics. Of much more concern to the authorities in Dublin and London was the novel politi- cal activity of educated Catholics. Their old aristocratic leaders, whose loyalty to the Crown was unquestioned and whose shyness of politics- was proverbial, were nudged out by new men of less certain loyalty and more aggressive disposition born of success in commerce. They were greatly encouraged by Protestant sympathy and the general unrest of the times. In 1791 they openly demanded equal rights for Roman Catholics. In 1792, under their guidance and against the opposition of prelates and priests, elected delegates from all over the country held a Catholic Convention in Dublin, which appealed over the heads of the Irish government to the king in London. It was an astoundingly bold step for Irish Roman Catholics to take. They had never dared do anything like this before. If they did not get satisfaction by constitu- tional means, would they not fall into the embrace of the republican United Irishmen, and with them throw Ireland into a wild revolution?
 The British repudiation of Fitzwilliam let the revolutionary move- ment run wild in Ireland. The United Irishmen, reconstituted as a conspiratorial society that aimed at a general rebellion in conjunction with a French invasion, set out to capture the Catholic peasantry, without whose support no such rising was possible. The blow from London paralyzed the political influence of the Catholic gentry and clergy over the masses, who were thereby exposed to the appeals of the mad schemers. Defenderism also helped the latter by providing a ready- made organization for them to take over and expand. This they did, not by preaching democracy and republicanism, neither of which meant anything to the peasants, but by promising them the abolition of the tithe and by playing on their fears of what was in store for them.
 Reaction was no longer possible. It ended in 1822, with a reorgani- zation of the government that gave the upper hand to progressive Tories. Though opposed to parliamentary reform, they believed the only way to preserve the political ascendancy of the landed class was to follow a liberal and reforming policy. The new leaders, instead of belonging to the old aristocracy, represented the rising well-to-do class.
 The Colonial Office grew in power from the very beginning, as its chiefs tackled a rather awkward problem of central administration. The secretary of state was not the only head of a department who could give orders to officials in the colonies; for the Customs, the Treasury, the Post Office, and the Ordnance each had local staffs scattered about the empire, and these local staffs were answerable only to their respec- tive departments in London. Hitherto there had been no coordination of these independent services, with the result that each had gone its own way with little or no regard for the interests of any colony as a whole; and the local governor could do nothing about it, no matter how seriously he might be embarrassed by the actions of local officials over whom neither he nor anyone else in the colony had any control. This was intolerable to Bathurst and Goulburn. They were determined to get cooperation of all the services in each colony, and by degrees they got it. From his vantage point in the cabinet, Bathurst was able to as- sert an authority over the other departments to bring their regulations and their colonial agents into line. The Colonial Office thus gained a general supervision over all official matters pertaining to colonies, and, in addition, it absorbed various functions that it could perform more effectively than those who had been responsible for them. It was also during Bathurst's regime that we see the Colonial Office coming under the influence of the humanitarian movement, which was to leave an indelible stamp upon British colonial policy. Bathurst was reputed to be friendly toward the "Clapham sect," so called because the original members of the group, which included Wilberforce, had lived as close neighbors in the suburban community of Clapham and were evangelical churchmen whose piety was as strict as it was un- pretentious. They were men of independent means and outstanding ability who devoted their fortunes and their lives to the humanitarian cause. They were often called "the saints," and there was as much truth as jest in the nickname. They were the core of the awakening national conscience, which has been mentioned earlier. It was they who pro- vided the driving leadership in the antislavery movement and in the founding of missionary societies, which inaugurated the modern Brit- ish missionary movement. One of the ablest of this remarkable group was James Stephen, Wilberforce's brother-in-law, a lawyer and a mem- ber of parliament, who was recognized as such an authority on matters of slavery and the cause of the black race generally 2 that his advice was constantly sought by government officials at least as early as 1807. It was perhaps only natural therefore that Bathurst and Goulburn should cultivate such a valuable established connection when they took charge of the colonies five years later. This connection undoubtedly led to another and, in time, a more famous one with the second generation of the Clapham sect.
 Mother Country," his enemies called him, but that was because they were impractical reformers who could not bend him to their will. He was more enlightened than they were, though only now is this coining to be fully realized. His guiding motive was not the concentration of authority over the colonies, nor any selfish interest of the metropolitan state. A deeply religious and highly conscientious man, he was above all else, from first to last, the champion of the colored races against oppression by the whites. He was the vigorous personification of the new principle of trusteeship, which thenceforth characterized British colonial policy.
 The degeneration of the governmental system was quite different from what had been allowed to occur in the "old thirteen" colonies.
 4 Not the least achievement of this new governmental agency was its control of insect pests.
 In that election Canadian national unity took a great stride forward without any aid from the United States. Laurier, now prime minister, quickly restored the national harmony by applying persuasion instead of coercion to the province of Manitoba, which kept its unified school system but modified its regulations by allowing voluntary religious in- struction of Roman Catholic and Protestant children separately during school hours and by abandoning the requirement that all teaching must be in the English tongue. This amicable settlement of an angry ques- tion was typical of Laurier's more general achievement in drawing English Canada and French Canada together. In addition to being almost worshipped by his own people as their greatest son, he gained a personal ascendancy in English Canada which no English Canadian leader has ever paralleled in French Canada. For all his great charm and understanding, Laurier could not have done this had it not been for the fact that, though he was always a devout Roman Catholic, he would never tolerate the interference of his own church in the political field. He had openly fought it from the beginning of his public career. The climax came in 1896, when the bishops issued mandaments to be read from every pulpit directing the people to vote Conservative. On emerging victorious against such odds, Laurier and several other promi- nent Roman Catholics, irrespective of race, joined in an appeal to Rome against the political activity of the local hierarchy; the papal court sent out a prince of the church to investigate; and thenceforth the Roman Catholic clergy in Canada eschewed politics. All this, of course, saved Laurier from falling under English Canadian and Protes- tant suspicions as a possible tool of his church, and thereby enabled him to bridge the national gap. Also in 1896 the Canadian nation commenced to grow in size, in strength, and in self-confidence at an amazing rate, for then the empty West began to fill with a rush and the dominion as a whole entered upon a period of abounding prosperity. The Liberals gleefully claimed all the credit for this great turn in the country's fortune, but these politicians had little to do with the splendid tide except to ride high upon it. What produced it was an astonishing combination of influ- ences outside Canada.
 Inevitably many of the older ones remained foreign, but Canadian society digested the younger generation and the task made Canadians more consciously Canadian.
 Why were New Zealanders so lacking in national maturity, or, to put the question in another way, why did they not catch the current fever of nationalism? A clew may be found in the character of New Zealand society, which was quite distinct from that of Australia. It was more akin to that of the mother country, more, indeed, than any other in the world. "More English than England" is a phrase that many observers have applied to New Zealand. This use of the adjective "English" is of course the careless and common one which irritates Scots anywhere and not least in New Zealand, where they form an important 25 per cent of the population. Passing by this innocent inaccuracy, and accepting the meaning of the phrase as it was intended, we should note that it sums up a deep-rooted tradition. The founders of New Zealand sought to transplant a representative section of British society, not just a working class segment of it; they selected the colonists 2 J. B. Condliffe, New Zealand in the Making (Chicago, 1930), p. 431.
 Yet Boer nationalism was not so solid as French Canadian. The French Canadians were a compact body and had defied all attempts to Anglicize diem. The Boers on the other hand had been split by die Great Trek, when their intransigent minority wandered off into die wilderness where they cut themselves off from all contact with modern civilization, while their fellows remained behind in the parent colony where the best of them were more or less assimilated to British culture.
 "My mission is to pacify Ireland," said Gladstone when summoned to form his first ministrv in December 1868. He and manv of his follow- * * ers believed that dangerous Irish discontent would wither away if they cut away its religious and economic roots the privileged position of the Irish Church (Anglican), and the oppressive land system. Accord- ingly, in 1869 parliament disestablished the Irish Church, reducing it to a voluntary organization deprived of the right to collect tithes and of all endowments acquired before 1660; and in 1870 a Land Act was passed. The first measure removed a grave injustice long condemned by public opinion, but the second fell far short of what was needed.
 Meanwhile Irish nationalism was recovering from the hopeless state into which it had fallen by 1893. That year saw the founding of the Gaelic League by seven literary scholars in Dublin for the prime pur- pose of reviving the Irish language. Early in the nineteenth century it was still the native tongue of the majority of the population; but as the century drew to a close the mass of Irishmen spoke only English thanks largely though not entirely to famine and heavy emigration, the effects of which were greatest in the purely Irish districts, and to the influence of the Roman Catholic clergy, who frowned on the use of Gaelic. Scottish Gaelic had been declining too, but not so rapidly, for Presbyterian Highlanders had been given the Bible in Gaelic and were taught to read it. The cognate Goidelic speech, long extinct in north- west and southwest England, survived only in Wales and there it was strong. It had gained a new lease of life in the late eighteenth century, when its adoption by Wesleyan preachers enabled them to sweep that part of the country into the Methodist fold, and in the nineteenth century from the revival of the mediaeval eisteddfod in 1819 as an annual national festival.

 6. Marchant married a clergyman, Reverend Jabez Ambrose Comfort, at the age  of thirty- seven, which places the event chronologically close to the publication  of this novel. She also assisted in training Methodist ministers and, according  to her obituary, undertook ‘the functions of a lay preacher’ (1941, p. 569).

 From the early 1620s, English charters also embraced and anticipated  massive transfers of population as colonization’s purpose. Clearly the first  to do so was Sir William Alexanders’s “New Scotland” grant. Its emphasis  lay on colonization as an act of self-renewal undertaken by a population  “led forth into new territory, which they may fill with colonies.”72 The  sentiment became commonplace.73
 The impact of Blackstone’s Commentaries as a guide to the substance of  English law and procedure and as a stimulus to constitutional contention was  to be assisted by a phenomenon of empire—the networking and peripatetic  careers of colonial officials.24 As Bridget Brereton and John Bennett have  demonstrated in their biographical work, the movement between colonies of  judges with developed views on law and constitutionalism influenced legal  and political discourse in those possessions.25 Moreover, judges who needed  to test their understanding of the law were not shy about making contact with  their counterparts in other colonies who might have faced similar issues.26
 Elite hauteur, manipulation of the levers of colonial governance and  law, and an obsessive fear of disloyalty among the population were evident  in Upper Canada in the years after the War of 1812. The law officers of  the Crown and most of the judges were associated with a group described  as the Family Compact—including colonial officials, businessmen, and  churchmen—committed to preserving and replicating their own high  Tory, anti-democratic values in the governance of the colony.47 For the  Crown lawyers the justice system was a legitimate instrument for neutral- izing or even ridding themselves of those with a different vision of soci- ety. The exclusivist views of these men did not go unchallenged, however.  The presence of reformist lawyers, such as William Warren Baldwin, in  the Assembly in the early 1820s was to introduce the discourse of a more  liberal constitutional tradition, drawing strength from eighteenth-century  English country Whigs, Irish Whig ideology, and expansive readings of  Blackstone. Baldwin went on the attack against the Sedition Act. He argued  that as long as the Act, with its provisions for summary arrest and banish- ment, remained in force Upper Canadians were “without a constitution,  at least a free one.” “The statute,” he continued, “remained in force not  only in the face of Magna Carta, but directly in the face of all the statutes  made for the liberty and protection of the subject.”48 Baldwin began assert- ing that the Constitution Act of 1791 represented a compact between the  Crown and people of Upper Canada (reflecting his own Irish Whig heri- tage and the influence of Thorpe’s thinking), a compact that could not be  altered without the consent of the governed. This latter point represented  a position close to that of the English reformist and radical Whigs of the  mid-eighteenth century.49 Here were the seeds of what became in a short  time the reformers’ manifesto for the grant of responsible government.
 The peoples indigenous to North America did not view sovereignty or  kings this way. These were non-state societies governed through councils  of chiefs and elders representing networks of clans or extended families  within and between villages. Political order was intimately connected to  spiritual order, and both were oriented toward relations of kinship. Kinship  transcended temporal and physical boundaries: trees, water, and animals  were infused with spiritual life—with manitous—and survival necessitated  spiritual balance with them through constant gift-giving. Peaceful rela- tions with the elements of the natural world and peoples within that world  meant establishing and maintaining relationships of spiritual-kinship by  creating reciprocal obligations of care. To give or receive presents was to  renounce the status of alien and to become kin. The snake-manitou met  by the Saulteurs on their way to Niagara was a grandfather and gifts were  needed to ensure its good thoughts. This episode is not unrelated to the  message of the Great Turtle given in the shaking tent, that the Crown’s  representative would fill their canoes with presents. To establish political  relations was to create obligations of care between members of an extended family. To have a wealthy king as father meant having a caring relation  who would provide gifts, offer counsel, and ward off danger.17
 The parliamentary committee, therefore, had ample evidence before it  of the distinctive aboriginal language from Canada of Crown as father.  But the report itself reveals no outward signs that the committee appreci- ated the traditional meaning of that phrase for indigenous peoples, and  its recommendations were wholly consistent with Crown paternalism of  the common law parens patriæ variety. That indigenous peoples in Canada  themselves referred to the Crown as father seems to have reinforced the com- mittee’s vision of the Crown as protector of aboriginal peoples throughout  the empire, if only indirectly or implicitly. In its reports in later years, the  successor to the select parliamentary committee on aborigines, the (extra- parliamentary) Aborigines Protection Society, would continue to advo- cate paternal Crown control of indigenous peoples in British colonies and  would use to this end statements from Indian chiefs in Canada expressing  thanks for the protection of their “great mother the Queen.”56 The pater- nalistic and moralistic ideas advanced by these groups were received sym- pathetically in a colonial office run by the likes of Lord Glenelg and James  Stephen, humanitarians closely linked by family ties to Wilberforce and  the Clapham Sect.57 Over time, this brand of moralistic paternalism would  be woven with other strands into the theory and practice of empire.58 On  an abstract level, it would inform theories of liberal imperialism developed  by utilitarians such as J.S. Mill.59 In practical terms, it would justify par- ticularly aggressive—indeed oppressive and abusive—government policies,  such as the Indian residential school system aimed at the forced assimila- tion of aboriginal peoples into Euro-Canadian society.60
 Part III Frontiers of Justice Samuel Marsden’s Civility  The Transposition of Anglican Civil Authority to Australasia Andrew Sharp I It is appropriate that the study of the colonial transposition of British  government should focus on an array of impersonal and abstract   instruments—sovereignty, occupation, the rule of law, natural rights— not least because such instruments can have quite concrete effects in  establishing the terms of intelligibility and argument for the exercise of  colonial rule. It is no less appropriate, though, that such study should  also investigate the much less abstract and impersonal issue of the “char- acter” or “persona” of those charged with wielding such instruments in  the concrete exercise of government. Eighteenth-century English society  remained firmly under the sway of the Anglican settlement of religious  civil war, which had installed broad-church Anglicanism and the com- mon law as the two central pillars of social government.1 It also remained  a society of “offices”—that is, a society in which duties and rights were  packaged in interlocking role-specific bundles—such that the exercise of  social authority was no abstract matter. It required rather the cultivation of  a specific character or persona—the office-specific personality of the king,  magistrate, parson, midwife, philosopher, husbandman, and so on—that  formed the condition for successful occupancy of an office and the exercise  of its social powers.2 The colonial transposition of English social authority thus took place in and through the movement of particular “official” per- sonages: governors, lawyers, missionaries, soldiers, and magistrates. It is  no surprise then that the office through which the combined authority of  Anglicanism and common law was concretely exercised in England—the  dual office of clergyman and justice of the peace—should have had such  decisive importance for the exercise of this authority in colonial Australia  and New Zealand. It was as the occupant of this double office that Samuel  Marsden (1765–1838) earned his celebrated or notorious place in the his- tory of colonial Australia and New Zealand. He personified the mix of  evangelical rectitude and judicial implacability that was required by the  “character” of his office, even though this has been reduced to the level  of personal foible by an often unsympathetic later historiography. At first,  especially before the Macquarie years, Marsden’s character was, naturally  enough, largely judged by his fellow settlers as a function of his person- ality. It was after all a society in which roles were unclearly differentiated  and taken ad hoc by those who would and could fill them; and so appear- ance, energy, and temperament counted for much. Few appreciated his  office and character: what he lived for and habitually practiced. What is  remarkable is that a politics (and later, a historiography) of personality  continued to provide the frame for judging Marsden’s actions, even after  New South Wales had become an extended society in which offices and  personae had become, in fact, more determinative than individual temper- ament. In attempting to understand the early stages of the transmission of  English legal and religious culture to New South Wales, then, it is vital to  study the man’s office and the character cultivated for it, without reducing  these to personal foible, for it is in the character of pioneers—the auctors of  a new or transplanting society—that lodge the deep structures of control  that they bring with them.
 Many of Marsden’s generation, though, did support the export of  protestant Christianity.4 In London in May 1809, Rev. Legh Richmond  preached to the annual meeting of the Church Missionary Society to  Africa and the East (CMS). He took as his text the injunction of Jesus in  John 11:16 to “Feed my sheep.” He urged his hearers to extend their finan- cial support to the organization’s ramifying missions and to pray for their  success. One of his congregation, Marsden himself was home, busy orga- nizing an Anglican mission to New Zealand. In his sermon, with a strik- ing eloquence that was long remembered,5 Richmond, appropriately to the  occasion, imagined a “statesman,” a “merchant,” a “natural philosopher,”  and a “curious traveler” examining a world map from their separate points  of view. (It is notable that he did not imagine a “colonist,” an uncommon  and unattractive figure at the time).6 The Christian “beholds the world’s  map” in a very different way from the others. “He has a subject of investi- gation far beyond them all. What they have overlooked and disregarded,  is everything to him.” He looks for “the visible kingdom of Christ”; then  he will see “how small a part of those immense tracts of country which the  map presents to his view, so much as know whether there be any Christ!” In fact Marsden had seen the world exactly this way when he first left  for New South Wales in 1793. His diary of the seven-month voyage out  records his single-minded commitment to bring the gospel to the convicts  and to the heathen natives of “New Holland.”7 The salvation of souls was  to be his life’s work. So it was not a new man who left England for the last  time in 1809 to the strains of the “Old Hundredth” Psalm.8 It was simply  one who was reinvigorated by an eighteen-month stay in his homeland  and who now had further flocks in mind: the New Zealanders, and the  growing numbers of convict, free, and freed settlers in New South Wales.
 Under Hunter and King, Marsden was among the most prominent  magistrates of the colony, burdened with a great number of administra- tive as well as pastoral and judicial tasks. His experience led him to offer  his thoughts in three extended papers around 1806, intended for King,  his successor William Bligh, and the authorities in England.22 The papers  discussed unmarried convict women living with men, the toleration of  the Catholic religion among the Irish convicts, and the trade in spirituous  liquors. As a recent writer has shown, Marsden’s opinion of the morals and  law-abidingness of convict women was low; he disapproved of the military  élite’s trading and monopoly in hard liquor as a medium of exchange; and  most of all he abhorred the Irish Catholic convicts.23 Each was excoriated  as a corrupting source of sin and crime.
 Hunter and King felt the same about the Irish: the two continually com- plained to Downing Street of those among them who were sent out for their  parts in the 1798 rebellion. They were “ignorant, obstinate, and depraved,”  “turbulent and worthless characters,” “insolent, refractory, and troublesome,”  “perjurers,” “wicked and disaffected,” “discontented,” and of “troublesome  spirit.” Above all they were “seditious.”24 Marsden, reflecting on his and his  fellow magistrates’ experience of Irish unrest,25 wrote in his Irish paper: The Toleration of the Catholic Religion would not only be dangerous to  the present Inhabitants; and to the Government; but also to the rising  Generation; and would lay the Foundation for future internal Wars and  commotions. The Catholics who have Children . . . would bring them up  in their own Persuasion; and would instil into their Minds all the Hatred  against Church and State, which they themselves possess.
 School teachers would join the clergy in that task: “Men of tolerable  Education and good Morals, who would willing devote their time and  Study to instruct the rising Generation.” Marsden was, then, an integrationist, pursuing a protestant and rural  ideal. He considered it possible to transform the population by the appli- cation of a non-doctrinal ethical Christianity, hardly considering, until  much later, possible Catholic, dissenter, and even Methodist objections to  the Anglican church’s dominating the colony. And these sentiments were  consistent with his record. He had recruited schoolteachers and (mainly  dissenting) pastors for New South Wales among the LMS refugees from  Tahiti and Tonga and organized their payment by both governors and the  Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. He had agitated for the building  and maintenance of churches and schools. He had played a major part in  the founding of a female orphan school, and a female factory for secluding  and educating young women in useful productive skills. In London he was  to promote the continuation and extension of his program of Christian  education and the reform of sexual relations.40

 Mackerel was a vindictive passerby in one of many early modern English  towns. In New South Wales in 1795, the brawl between Boston and the  New South Wales Corps constituted a much more obvious and important  rupture of the illusion of universal Peace. Boston v Laycock occurred in a  nascent colonial town: the only place where a plausible imitation of order  could be maintained. It involved some of the most important and notori- ous free men in the colony: free businessmen and members of the New  South Wales Corps. They represented two major and opposing interests  in a settlement largely comprised of convict men and women who them- selves constituted a threat to public order. When the parties to Boston v  Laycock brawled, everyone saw. When they disagreed in court over how  best to keep the Peace, everyone heard. Indeed, as the participants knew  as much about the law as most of their lay judges, their arguments carried  disproportionate weight in the colony. If Mackerel’s urination showed the  contestability of Peace in early modern England, then this public spat in  early Sydney shook the little colony at its legal foundations.
 These proposals were often aimed at generating commercial and, par- ticularly, political interest and support. To build political coalitions and  to present a “respectable” face to government and the public, promoters  stressed the moral and economic independence offered by emigration as  well as the greater freedom of action offered by colonial settings. In the  case of South Australia and New Zealand, many promoters of coloniza- tion were loosely connected through support for various ideas of “colonial  reform” and “systematic colonization.”4 Such proposals were not without  their critics, particularly given the questionable credentials of prominent  promoters such as Edward Gibbon Wakefield. In British debates colonies  could be presented as being socially fragile, bereft of the stability that long- standing institutions of law, religion, and property might be seen as giv- ing a society. To try to counter such perceptions, systematic colonization  proposals often involved detailed proposals for institutional structures and  constitutional relationships. Such proposals were designed to show respect- able authorship and provide assurances of colonial stability.5
 Altering the law on oaths and evidence had been a recurrent issue among  lobbyists and commentators on imperial affairs in the early nineteenth cen- tury. Issues of slave and indigenous evidence were often of concern to the  Colonial Office. A series of contentious reforms in 1809 and again in 1828  allowed limited categories of unsworn testimony in the Cape Colony, as  part of attempts to assert control over and anglicize Cape institutions and  social structures.17 As Russell Smandych has explored, following the aboli- tion of slavery the office sought to prevent colonial assemblies, restricting  the admissibility of evidence by ex-slaves.18
 Ostensibly “philanthropist” groups set up in association with the South  Australian colonization scheme advocated allowing unsworn indigenous  testimony.19 However, the testimonial capacity of Aborigines was of lim- ited concern to the South Australian lobbyists before the colony’s founding  legislation was passed in 1834. Colonization plans reflected intellectual  currents, but they also reflected political pressures and preoccupations.  The metropolitan promoters of South Australia focused on convicts and   irregular settlers as the colonial challenges facing their schemes. Aboriginal  rights emerged as a late and hurriedly addressed issue.20 However, a  number of systematic colonization lobbyists from the South Australian  scheme moved on to formulate proposals for New Zealand settlements.21  The volume of information available in Britain about New Zealand and  the level of interest in Māori society encouraged promoters to theorize  how Māori society might interact with colonial government and society,  and to use such theorizing as part of political lobbying. Admitting Māori  testimony became a stock means of claiming an informed and “enlight- ened” approach to colonization.22 Nonetheless, references to evidentiary  capacity in colonization proposals had limited impact on government. In  1838 Lord Glenelg deflected New Zealand Company proposals for the  admission of Māori evidence in any new colonial system, saying the issue  was too sensitive to be resolved in the abstract.23 Imperial legislation was  predominately reactive. In the absence of a particular political controversy  there was limited political will to respond to abstract appeals to principle  from London observers, particularly given the self-interest of promoters  seeking to purchase land directly from Māori.24

 The underground network that bound the conspiracy together was provided by the Baptist church. The official Baptist church was controlled by white missionaries, and although they were abolitionist in sympathy, perhaps mindful of the fate of John Smith in Demerara, they preached a message of patient obedience and resignation. Alongside and within their church, however, there was the Native Baptist church, with its own black leadership, that preached a very different message. The leader of the conspiracy, Samuel Sharpe, was the chief deacon at the colony’s most important Baptist chapel, Thomas Burchell’s Montego Bay Baptist Chapel. He was also a native Baptist preacher. Sharpe, according to the white missionary Henry Bleby, was “the man whose active brain devised the project and he had sufficient authority with those around him to carry it into effect, having acquired an extraordinary degree of influence among his fellow slaves”. He was “certainly the most intelligent and remarkable slave I ever met”, Bleby later recalled, a man “possessed of intellectual and oratorical powers above the common order”. Sharpe used his position as a privileged slave to spread the conspiracy, recruiting new adherents, preaching liberation and preparing for the coming day. At the end of prayer meetings on the plantations, selected individuals believed to be sympathetic would be invited to stay behind after the service, and either Sharpe himself or other leaders would attempt to win them over. One of those recruited in this way, Edward Hylton, later told Bleby that Sharpe had: Referred to the manifold evils and injustices of slavery; asserted the natural equality of man with regard to freedom; and referring to the Holy Scriptures as his authority, denied that the white man had any more right to hold the blacks in bondage than the black had to enslave the whites… Once they were won over, the new recruits swore on the Bible not to return to work after Christmas except as free men and women.52 Christianity had become a “revolutionary ideology”, “a positive justification for action”, that steeled them for the struggle ahead. Among the biblical texts that spoke to their aspirations was John viii: 36: “If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed”.53

As well as attempting to intimidate the clergy, the government gave serious consideration to introducing a scheme of state payment in an attempt to buy their loyalty. As Nassau Senior had succinctly put it, “Troops are more expensive than priests”—from P Gray, Famine, Land and Politics, p12. The Catholic hierarchy rejected Russell’s various proposals, but although many bishops attacked the government, they never presented a united front with regard to the starvation of so many of their flock.

 Catholic Emancipation 29, 33
 10 By “authoritarian Whigs,” I mean those members of the long-standing Whig  establishment who, especially after 1760, embraced a more conservative and  autocratic form of politics in reaction to the developing radicalism of the period.
 In the past two decades most scholars have accepted the argument advanced by  Linda Colley that anti-Catholicism lay at the very root of how British identity was forged  in the eighteenth century. Whether discussing policies of state, cultural constructions  of nationalism, or the religious characteristics of the empire, the prevailing orthodoxy  views Catholics as the foil against which Britons defined, understood, and conducted  themselves.4 What would happen, then, when a hundred thousand Catholic “new  subjects” became a part of the British Empire in the aftermath of the Seven Years’ War?  Were these Catholics, only recently the loyal subjects of Britain’s arch enemies France  and Spain, to be exiled, assimilated, or accommodated? In short, could the Catholic  ever become a loyal Briton?
 My principal argument is that anti-Catholicism, while strong among ordinary  Britons and colonists seeking to advance themselves and ensure their own rights during  a turbulent era, was not as prevalent in the official mind of empire, as scholars have  commonly assumed. Indeed, in the period between 1763 and 1783, British ministers  generally sought to accommodate Catholics and the practices, functions, and personnel  of their church (the focus of this chapter) in order to increase the empire’s stability  and productivity. In response to the increasingly complex “politics of difference” that  resulted from imperial expansion in this period, religious accommodation became  an important tool in Britain’s “repertoire of imperial power,” one that was gradually  adopted to the strategic and commercial needs of the empire.6
 Governing Catholics before 1763
 While all Catholics in the British Isles labored under significant disabilities during  the early eighteenth century, it was in Ireland where anti-Catholicism was most  institutionalized and affected the largest number of people. After the Williamite conquest in 1691, the victorious Protestant Ascendancy erected a comprehensive set  of Penal Laws designed to deny Catholics religious, political, and economic equality  and keep them in their place as suspect, second-class, subjects. Recent studies of the  Penal Laws have demonstrated that in practice they were unevenly enforced and that  many Catholics were able to work around them. Indeed, despite the legal constraints  placed upon them, a relatively prosperous and influential Catholic middling class  emerged in the course of the century, particularly in fields such as medicine and trade.7  But the fact remains that all Irish Catholics, even the prosperous, suffered disabilities  and discriminations. They could not receive a Catholic education, bear arms, marry  Protestants, practice law, or vote. Their priests were closely monitored and restricted in  their movements and required to take the Oath of Abjuration.8 Oath requirements (in  the Test Act) were also deployed to exclude Catholics from holding public office and,  as will be seen, became a tool used widely if ineffectively to manage Catholic subjects  and their priests in the ceded colonies. Finally, laws that barred Catholics from buying  rural property or from practicing primogeniture effectively finished the job, begun  with the plantations of the previous centuries, of transferring the island’s real estate  into Protestant hands. By 1774, Catholics, two-thirds of the island’s people, possessed  only 5 percent of its land.9
 At first, the actual goal of British policy was not to tolerate Roman Catholicism  indefinitely. In the early years of the occupation, hopes ran high that Minorcans,  inspired by the example of British industry, prosperity, and morality, would willingly  adopt Protestantism.13 Archbishop Wake proposed that the government build two  new Anglican churches, staffed with well-paid ministers, and a school to educate  both the children of the garrison and native children in the ways of Protestantism and  Britishness. He also urged the governor to demand the highest standards of conduct  on the part of British soldiers, so that they might set an example for the Minorcans to  emulate.14 Meanwhile, Lieutenant Governor Richard Kane, an Ulster Presbyterian who  had fought for William’s Protestant cause against both James and Louis XIV before  being assigned to Minorca, took steps to banish foreign priests and friars, whom he  suspected of secretly conspiring with Spain.15
 Bringing about a Minorcan reformation was clearly a strategy for the long term;  in the meantime, successive British governors attempted to exert control over church  governance. To do so, they necessarily challenged the authority of the Bishop of  Majorca, who had overseen the Minorcan Church since the thirteenth century. For  decades, the British pressed for the establishment of a separate see for Minorca, which  would free the Minorcan Church from Spanish oversight.16 Until this happened, British  authorities closely monitored the Spanish bishop and his appointed vicar general on  the island. Kane ordered the vicar general to submit for his approval a list of Minorcan  preachers; he also required priests to take an unqualified oath of loyalty and pray in  public for the royal family. When the vicar general, under the bishop’s instructions,  refused to abide by these regulations, Kane banished him. The governor explained  that he would “serve in like manner” any remaining priests who “give uneasiness to  the State,” and he subsequently denied a request from the bishop himself to visit the  island.17
 British policy toward the Catholic community of Acadia underwent a decided shift  toward anglicization in the years following the war. First, the British began to build  a counterweight to Fortress Louisbourg, which the French had constructed on Cape  Breton Island after 1713 in an attempt to check British territorial claims. The British  treasury spent lavishly to establish a naval base and settlement at Halifax, in Chebucto  Bay on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia. Governor Edward Cornwallis heavily fortified  the town to protect the thousands of new British and foreign Protestant settlers who  arrived in the 1750s and help to extend British authority through the region. Second,  anglicization motivated the crown’s policies to the colony’s ecclesiastical settlement  and the Acadians. The instructions issued to Cornwallis concerning religion and  relations between Catholic Acadians and Protestant settlers were extensive and  specific: he must refuse to allow the Bishop of Quebec to visit the colony and to  exercise episcopal authority (especially his practice of excommunicating Catholics  who married Protestants); he was to allot land to every Anglican schoolteacher and  clergyman sent by London, as well as to Acadians who converted; and he must “give  all possible encouragement” to educating Catholic children in Protestant schools and  intermarriage between the French inhabitants and Protestants.30
 In the aftermath of the expulsion, the British quickly erected the institutions and laws  necessary to put the colony on a firmly Protestant foundation. The first legislative assembly  was summoned in 1757; Catholics were refused the franchise and the ability to sit in the  assembly. The assembly got to work erecting an anti-Catholic penal code: Catholics could  not own land, Catholic priests were banished, and individuals who harbored priests were  subject to heavy fines.32 Meanwhile, the Church of England became the colony’s officially  established religion, although dissenters were given “free Liberty of Conscience” and  released from taxes collected to support the established church. Catholics, on the other  hand, were specifically excluded from the religious freedom the colony was then touting  to attract settlers. Describing the situation in Nova Scotia on the eve of the Seven Years’  War, Stephen Patterson observes that the region, “given the plural society developing  in it, badly needed a cultural or intellectual framework based on accommodation and  toleration, [but] neither the materials nor the creative intelligence had yet emerged to  forge it.”33 This was true not only for Nova Scotia, but all parts of the growing empire.
 During the first half of the eighteenth century, Catholics in both the British Isles  and across the empire lived under significant legal disabilities and faced both official  and popular discrimination. In some places, despite this, they might have room to  maneuver and even prosper, as evidenced by the emergent Catholic middle class  in Ireland and Acadia’s dynamic growth during the years between 1713 and 1750.  Moreover, the British tolerated the practice of Catholicism and the presence of priests,  whom they monitored closely. But the prevailing attitude toward the empire’s Catholics  was that they were not in the king’s trust: they should be restricted in their rights, kept  on a very tight rein, and, if necessary, could be forcibly expelled from their lands.
 Accommodating Catholics after 1763
 At the same time, there is evidence that domestic British attitudes toward Catholics  were also changing. It had traditionally been assumed that the political loyalties of Irish  Catholics lay not with the Hanoverians but with the exiled Stuarts and with Rome. By  the 1760s however, the futility of the Jacobite cause was finally accepted. In 1766, upon  the death of the Old Pretender, even the Vatican decided to acknowledge the legitimacy  of the Hanoverian succession.39 This made it possible not only for British Catholics to  express their loyalty to the king but also for British politicians to think of them as loyal  subjects. Indeed, historians have perceived a weakening of anti-Catholic sentiment  on the part of English elites in this period. That British ministers and Irish Catholic  leaders had begun to contemplate allowing Irish Catholics to serve openly in the army  indicated a new willingness to acknowledge their credentials as loyal Britons.40
 Johnston was also intent upon asserting his authority over the Minorcan Church,  but metropolitan authorities consistently frustrated his plans and demanded he be  more accommodating. Many of the privileges that Johnston had initially declared null  and void pertained to the church. This naturally upset church leaders, members of the  religious orders, and the laity and put them on their guard. One of Johnston’s primary  concerns was what he perceived as an alarming increase in the number of Catholic  clergy. He proposed several ways to stop and even reverse this trend (his main target  was the religious orders and especially the Franciscans), but successive secretaries of  state ignored his suggestions, ordering instead that the “people [were] to be made easy  by assurances that the Treaty of Utrecht will be observed with regard to Ecclesiasticks  as well as Seculars.”48 Johnston also locked horns with Dr. Gabriel Roig, the vicar  general who had been appointed during the French occupation and whom Johnston  now sought to remove. The two men and their representatives became embroiled in  bitter disputes: their battle over who controlled the island’s religious infrastructure led  at one point to British soldiers’ forcibly occupying a church, and their contestation  over church courts led Johnston to deny the request of a priest (who was suspected of  robbery) for an ecclesiastical trial to avoid imprisonment in a government jail.49
 When the expected flood of Protestant migrants did not materialize, the British  had to adapt their policy, and there was a decided shift away from efforts aimed at  assimilation and proscription on the basis of religion. The shift was clearly evident in  the administration of the colony’s first civilian governor, James Murray. Rather than  imposing English law across the board, he instituted a legal system that drew on both  English and French traditions, and he permitted Catholics to serve on juries and act as  barristers. He recognized French customary rights of inheritance. For fear the British  mercantile interests would dominate an elected assembly, he refused to convene one,  effectively keeping the colony under the martial law that had been in force since 1760,  and he appointed councilors who were friendly to the French.53
 The matter of Quebec’s ecclesiastical settlement received some preliminary attention  from metropolitan ministers in the years immediately following the war; political anti- Catholicism ran high among them, but imperial expansion demanded pragmatism.54  While maintaining anglicization as the long-term goal, they realized the need for  some immediate accommodation. Several memoranda in circulation demonstrate the  recognition that the secular clergy would have “to continue on their usual Footing” but  only under careful supervision by means of close vetting, the keeping of registries, and, if  necessary, banishments.55 As Egremont put it, the secular priests must be watched “very  narrowly”; those who would “busy themselves in any civil matters” must be immediately  removed.56 While the secular clergy might be tolerated, the same memos urged an almost  Henrician-style dissolution of the regular orders, or, at the very least, a gradual dying off  of their numbers.57 The same mix of accommodation and assimilation is evident in the  “Plan for the Establishment of Ecclesiastical Affairs in Quebec,” produced by the Board  of Trade in 1765. Its strategy was to offer temporary accommodation of the Catholic  Church while putting the Anglican Church on a firm foundation for the long term, thus  gradually anglicizing the ecclesiastical landscape in Canada.58
 At the same time, Melvill instituted a rather remarkable accommodation of the  Catholicism. Catholics could worship openly, and the state recognized the church’s  ceremonial and administrative functions (e.g., registrations of births and deaths).  This meant that colonial administrators accepted the need for priests to go about  their business. In the early years of the British administration, these included an Irish  Dominican named Father Devenish who had gone to Grenada from St. Croix and Father Benjamin Duhamel, a Capuchin from Martinique who had been accused of  having pro-British sympathies during the war.67 After the war, Vatican put the ceded  islands under the jurisdiction of the Vicar Apostolic of London, Richard Challoner.  Feeling overwhelmed by the scope of his responsibilities, he informed Rome that “we  are entirely ignorant of the present state of the Catholic religion in them [the ceded  islands], or what the ecclesiastical government is” and recommended that the Bishop of  Quebec be given responsibility for all the English colonies in America.68 Nevertheless,  Challoner was put in charge and did what he could to oversee Duhamel, whom he  appointed as his vicar general, and other priests in the ceded islands.69 Reporting in  1778 on the death of Duhamel, he expressed frustration about the “truly deplorable”  state of religion in Grenada. Yet, as deplorable as Challoner felt the condition of  the Catholic Church in Grenada was, it was still in better shape than the Church of  England. Melvill had attempted to follow his instructions to put it on a solid footing,  but he could neither get the land commissioners to allot lands for glebes nor convince  the assembly to pay ministers’ salaries.70
 Britain’s difficulty, Catholics’ opportunity: 1774–83
 Second, the Quebec Act was highly significant because it foreshadowed and set the  precedent for the shift to crown colony government that would come to characterize  the nineteenth-century empire. In fact, the only way the North ministry could justify  Catholicism’s legal establishment was to extend the state’s control over the Church.  It did so first by re-asserting the principle of the royal supremacy and, second, by  strengthening the crown’s authority (by concentrating power in the hands of the  governor and his appointed council).86 Royal instructions issued subsequently to  Carleton ordered him to subordinate the bishop, control ordinations and appointments  to benefices, and surveil religious communities. While Carleton, like Murray, chose a  more lenient approach, he did possess ultimate authority over Quebec’s ecclesiastical  affairs. The Act thus instituted accommodation of Catholicism in Quebec, but it was a  highly controlled and vigilant form of accommodation.87
 This groundbreaking experiment in religious accommodation in Quebec was  launched at the same time that a policy of more gradual Catholic relief was being  attempted in Ireland. While the pace of reform may have differed, the motivations  were the same: to ensure the loyalty of a potentially rebellious Catholic population  in time of war. As we have seen, Catholic relief in Ireland had been contemplated  during the 1760s and the initial legislative foray toward accommodation took place  with the very limited Bogland Act of 1772, but it was the exigencies of the American  war that prompted substantive (if still limited) relief, not only in the form of a new  oath for Catholics but also in laws affecting land ownership. The alliance of Catholic  France with the rebellious American colonists, concluded in the spring of 1778, raised  alarms about Ireland’s strategic vulnerability (the French might invade or infiltrate  Ireland in an effort to instigate a rebellion). That fall, citing Irish Catholics’ “peaceful  behaviour for a long series of years,” the Irish Parliament passed a relief act that  eased restrictions on inheritance and landholding.90 Arguing that a hidden agenda  lay behind the passage of these acts, Robert Donovan demonstrates that the need to  make Catholics available for military service was a primary motivation behind the  passage of relief in 1778. While the law did not explicitly legalize military service for  Catholics, it targeted two groups—the clergy and landed elites—who could encourage  Catholic enlistment.91
 The proposal of a similar bill for Scotland’s Catholics provoked the famous Gordon  riots in London, which Linda Colley and others have cited as evidence of the persistent anti-Catholicism that characterized British identity. But while popular prejudice and  outrage were no doubt significant (mobs raged uncontrolled in London for a week  and the homes of the legislation’s supporters, including Chief Justice Mansfield, were  attacked), the Irish and English acts remained in force and set the stage for further  reforms. Subsequent measures enacted by the Irish Parliament in 1782 allowed  Catholics to purchase land, removed the penalties aimed at the Catholic clergy, and  permitted the operation of schools by Catholics who had sworn allegiance to the  crown. That said, the provision of relief stopped well short of fully emancipating  Catholics—they still could not vote, practice law, attend Trinity College, establish a  seminary, or hold public office. Restrictions on public Catholic worship remained  in place. While a nearly total accommodation was deemed appropriate for Quebec’s  Catholics (who lived on the other side of the Atlantic and who vastly outnumbered  the colony’s Protestant old subjects), much more limited concessions were offered to  Catholics in Ireland. They were enough to get Catholics into the army and keep them  loyal, yet not too much to threaten the Ascendancy’s hold on power.
 But even while the tide was gradually turning toward accommodation in Ireland  and Quebec, its course was reversed in Grenada, as Governor George Macartney would  soon discover. A member of the Anglo-Irish gentry who had been educated at Trinity  College and trained for the bar in London, Macartney had already served as envoy to  Russia and Chief Secretary of Ireland. It did not take long after arriving in Grenada for  him to realize the extreme divisiveness of the society in his charge. He was particularly  appalled by the Protestant party’s “rancorous … hatred against the Catholic religion”  and especially its deep suspicion and fear of French-speaking, Catholic, free blacks.  Like his predecessors, Macartney rejected their attempts to introduce anti-Catholic  laws and policies.92

 Counterfactuals are, of course, impossible to prove. One cannot assert, for instance, with any degree of certitude, events that did not in fact occur, nor name that centralizing figure who might have been India’s Bismarck, Mazzini, Atatürk or Garibaldi in the absence of the British. But historical events find their own dramatis personae, and it is unreasonable to suggest that what happened everywhere else would not have happened in India. From such an initially hybrid system could have emerged a modern constitutional monarchy and political institutions built upon the Mughal administrative system, as modified by the Marathas. But these are hypotheticals. The British came, and no such non-colonial India emerged.
 Part of the problem was that the Indian social structures were unfamiliar to the British, whose own villages survived in a largely feudalistic relationship to their landlords. Empire was in many ways the vehicle for the extension of British social structures to the colonies they conquered. The socio-political constructs that the British made in their Empire were primarily reflections of the traditional, individualistic, unequal and still class-ridden society that existed in England. The architects of Empire, responding to what they knew, sought to recreate the rural arcadia of Tory England, where local government since the sixteenth century had been controlled by those with high social prestige and ruled by an established squirearchy. Instead of the autonomous village governments the British dismantled in India, English villages were in the hands of the traditional lords, the grandees being supplemented by gentry attached to them. The English tried to find similar structures in the traditional societies of their colonies, and when they could not, they invented an approximation of them. Thus was born the ‘indirect rule’ system of government that characterized much of the Empire, with power devolved to an entire hierarchy of greater and lesser imitation ‘gentlemen’, many given British-invented titles like ‘Rai Bahadur’ or even knighted (and, in a couple of cases, ennobled) for their pains. This was both less expensive for the Empire and, as with the English system at home, it was run by complicit amateurs, so there was no need to create a professional class of Indians who would wield, and then seek to exercise, political authority.
 Yes, it brought in a supposedly free press, but ensured it operated under severe constraints, and planted the seeds of representative parliamentary institutions while withholding the substance of power from Indians.
 Tocqueville wrote in his preface to Democracy in America that ‘it is the government  alone that has inherited all the privileges of which families, guilds and individuals have  been deprived’ by the march of democracy. In a cohesive society a representative  government could work in harmony with society. The British Empire in the mid- Victorian era was no such society; indeed, nor were many of its constituent parts. Some  of the individuals considered here responded by looking to decentralize the Empire into  smaller units, whilst others by the later nineteenth century instead saw the solution in the  movement towards imperial federation. Both of these remedies were shaped by responses  to Tocqueville. But the focus of both was on how the Empire was governed, and not on  what sort of society it was trending towards.
 The thinking of Alexis de Tocqueville about the world-historical future of the Anglo- Saxon peoples provided a set of intellectual categories that ran through the thinking of a  great many of the writers who so dominated the Colonial Society of 1868. Tocqueville  focused on the advance of equality and democracy in the modern world, and especially in  the English-speaking world (at least in his earlier works). It was in the 1830s and 1840s  that the founders of the 1868 Colonial Society were reading Tocqueville, and it was then  that they first began to pay attention to English colonies and to the kind of equality and  democracy that tended to characterize them. It was in those decades that the idea of  expanding the colonies to which British emigrants might go loomed large as a way of  coping with the problem of poverty in England itself.
 Empire as the Triumph of Theory surveyed the whole membership and looked in depth  at the main founders of the Colonial Society—thus the book established the overall  picture that I have outlined here.
 Mills the private observer Arthur Mills had always liked things to be systematic. An Inner Templer, he had made  his name in railway law, arguing for uniformity and central control in the development of  the railway network. He also attacked local or parish taxation of railways within Great  Britain. In an 1850 article, he argued that railway taxation ought to be centralized and  parish authority over railways curtailed.4 Half-jokingly this might be called ‘railway  imperialism’—but indeed it did mirror his belief in imperial centralization.
 There was a moral reason, too, why British colonization as everyone knew it— piecemeal colonization and settlement—had to be stopped and replaced by a programme  of colonization centrally directed from Whitehall. Colonization as it then existed was a  moral blight upon the landscape.
 Here was England’s imperial mission.
 England, too, had juries and a free press, and local institutions and a plethora of  political clubs—and in Tocqueville’s view these elements in English culture were  moderated and polished by the persistent aristocratic element that the United States did  not possess. And so English readers tended to be very pleased by the book. Democracy in  America was a wonderful success in England. The book was soon on the reading list at  Oxford and Cambridge, and on everyone’s tongue.38 John Stuart Mill reviewed it  enthusiastically, calling it ‘the beginning of a new era in the scientific study of politics’.39  But not everyone based his or her admiration for the book on the careful methodology  and the insightful but controlled generalizations that so appealed to Mill. Many people  simply liked the fact that Tocqueville pointed to a roughness in American society, and to  the dangers inherent in the ‘tyranny of the majority’. Others, of more interest to us, took  their pleasure from the book in a different way. The role that America played in  Democracy in America strengthened their own belief that English-speaking culture  constituted the main thrust of world history. So where Tocqueville was chiefly interested  in the future of democracy and culture in France and in Europe as a whole, certain  Englishmen turned to Tocqueville for his predictions about the future of the English- speaking societies overseas, including those still under the Crown—these were societies  that Tocqueville himself had not analysed.
 In his colonial lectures, Herman Merivale did just this. He followed Tocqueville a  considerable distance intellectually. He, too, looked at the forces of democracy and social  equality (as well as economic development) in self-governing overseas societies.  Lectures on Colonization and Colonies is mainly concerned with how those societies  would work. It is concerned with the political economy of settlement colonies in a  Tocquevillean world of overseas democracies—and not with dominion over non-whites.  ‘The native races’ are mentioned briefly, but only in the context of how the colonists treat  them.40
 For the English-speaking colonies that could profit from the democratic experiment,  then the next step after the establishment of local self-government was the establishment of municipal institutions. It was long ago pointed out— and never so well as by De Tocqueville,—that the peculiar political  advantage, which above all others enabled the founders of the American  Union to establish and consolidate that commonwealth, was the  antecedent existence of local self-government.60
 More revealing is the sixth and last piece in the book’s French Revolution section, a  curious essay called ‘Benjamin Franklin and Joseph de Maistre: A Dialogue of the Dead’.  The dead were playing tricks on Merivale, for the shade of Franklin is in fact none other  than that of the more recently deceased Tocqueville. De Maistre wanted to put society  back together after the French Revolution by somehow rebuilding a wide popular  consensus on the legitimacy of civil authority and the Roman Catholic Church—a church  that was not widely popular in Protestant England.116 Merivale’s Franklin, by contrast, is  made to talk of the inevitable growth of democracy, and how happiness for the masses is  better than the aristocratic happiness of the few—Tocqueville’s conclusion in Democracy  in America, and as we have seen Merivale’s, too, in Colonization and the Colonies.
 Although Stephen behaved civilly towards Rogers, even telling him on his first day in  the office (late in May 1846) that he looked on him as a possible successor,8 Rogers was  not making the best of impressions. Rogers never knew it, but Stephen’s comment that  Rogers might be his successor was made in spite and disgust; Stephen, an evangelical,  did not like the young Tractarian. The colonial secretary, Gladstone, seems to have hired  Rogers in the first instance because the two men shared an interest in something far  removed from the duties or concerns of a possible successor for James Stephen—namely,  the episcopacy. Indeed, Rogers’s surviving correspondence with his friend Gladstone is  mostly about the dear topic of colonial bishoprics, although occasionally they branched  out to discuss Canadian clergy reserves—and on rare occasions secular English politics.9  These years saw the high water mark of Rogers’s involvement with the High Church  missionary press.10
 In short, Bulwer-Lytton took the themes of family and stability that were so important  in England and the English and turned them into a fully (rather than only partially)  fictional form. In moving the picture of family and stability to the colonies, he was  employing a generalized ideal, for he had never been there.
 Having argued against any claim that slave sugar was a boon for the English poor, in  subsequent years Cave went on to try to develop real answers to the problems of crime  and poverty in England. His second publication, Prevention or Reformation: The Duty of  the State or Individuals?; with some account of a reformatory institution, came in 1856,  with its author identified not only as Stephen Cave, barrister-at-law, but also as the  honorary secretary of the ‘West London Preventive and Reformative Institution’, 237  Euston Road. Yes, Cave took a very direct step indeed to fight crime in England—he  opened his own prison.
 Fortescue came from an old Irish family, and he was the son of a member of the last  Irish House of Commons. Born in 1823, educated privately and at Christ Church, Oxford,  he won prizes in the humanities and took his BA in 1845 and his MA in 1847. He entered  parliament for Louth, as a Liberal. He was on the side of the angels, working for Jewish  emancipation and struggling against the anti-Catholic laws that had been passed after the  ‘papal aggression’—the restoration of the Roman Catholic episcopal hierarchy in  England in 1851. Still working against those laws, he became a junior Lord of the  Treasury from 1854 to 1855, next serving as the junior minister at the Colonial Office  from June 1857 to March 1858.
 Carnarvon was received by the British consul, Christian Rassam, brother of the  Hormuzd Rassam whom Carnarvon had met some months before. Over the years, Layard  and the Rassams played host to a number of future founders of the Colonial Society who  came to Nimrud to see the diggings10—another of them was Lord Bury, the Colonial  Society’s founder. But for now it was Carnarvon’s turn: ‘It was long’, he wrote in his  journal his first night there, ‘before I composed myself to sleep, so much was my  imagina-tion crossed by visions of palaces, of pomps and triumphs, and kings and cities  which Abraham himself perhaps had seen and admired.’11

 White English members of the clergy, like Nuttall, were far from the only persons who participated locally in constructing the Jamaican understanding of Victoria and the royal family more generally. But their reach was wide, and their influence arguably strong, for Christianity was an important part of life for many Jamaicans, especially those who aspired to middle-class status. The popularity of Christian churches in the Caribbean stemmed not only from their link with education (most West Indian schools were founded by Christian religious groups) but also from the fact that British religious leaders and evangelical missionaries had been prominent in the nineteenth-century anti-slavery campaign. As Arthur Charles Dayfoot has put it, in the West Indies, religious persons ‘became so identified with the achievement of emancipation that the Christian churches as a whole became the focus of gratitude and popularity.’12
 In 1900 the major Christian denominations in Jamaica were Baptist, Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian, Moravian, and Roman Catholic. There were also a variety of Brethren groups such as Bible Christians and Plymouth Brethren. By the middle of the twentieth century the Congregationalists, African Methodist Episcopalians, Seventh Day Adventists, Church of God, and the Salvation Army had established footholds, along with a wide variety of new churches based on the Methodist tradition. Thus, Jamaicans had a number of choices about where to attend church. And attend they did. In the first half of the twentieth century at least a quarter of all Jamaicans were registered members of a mainstream religious denomination, and many who were not formally registered attended services regularly. Church was a religious occasion, but it also had a strong social component.
 While the Anglican Church had originally been the planters’ church of choice and almost exclusively white, changes imposed from London from the mid-1820s to support emancipation meant that many more people of color entered the Anglican Church, until, like other West Indian churches, the majority of its members were people of color. Yet the Anglican and, to some degree the relatively small Roman Catholic Church in Jamaica continued to draw persons who considered themselves upper or upper-middle class. Most other churches in the region had originally been founded by missionaries, with a focus on converting and assisting the poor, and some still primarily served this population. Yet over the years, as the fortunes of persons of color improved, these churches came to include among their members middle–class professionals and business people—particularly in urban areas. A large cross-section of the Jamaican population—from wealthy to poor—belonged to the mainstream churches; and regularly attending services was usually seen as an indication of one’s respect for the proprieties, even if one’s own respectability was not fully established.13
 Thus, the role of the British monarch in the nineteenth century in many ways resembled the Victorian definition of the feminine function in society. Much of the success of Victoria’s reign (at least in terms of the British Isles) stemmed from the way in which Victorians unconsciously linked monarchy and nation in a symbolic marriage, with the monarch being the devoted wife and the nation the powerful and prosperous husband.16 The aura of this success carried over into the twentieth- century imperial context allowing colonial subjects to create, in Victoria, a model although these often became mixed with Christian elements, so that, for example, Christian saints popular in the Roman Catholic Church merged with African divinities while Native Baptists employed African traditions in their worship. Many of the African-influenced religious groups were locally distinct, thus in Trinidad there was Shango and Rada, and in Jamaica Revivilism and Kumina, and later Rastafarianism, while in Guyana Jordinites worshiped. There were also persons who attended Jewish synagogues in the major urban areas. Lila Melville, interview; Dayfoot, Shaping of the West Indian Church, 164, 190–214, 225–6.
 Attendance at official Jamaican royal memorial services, held at prominent Anglican churches in the colony (in Spanish Town or in Kingston) and planned to coincide with the day that the actual service was taking place in London, was also high throughout the period. While space at such services was reserved for local dignitaries, they were also open to the public and attracted many middle-class ‘coloureds’ as well as black ‘common folk’ who arrived early to gain admission. Those left outside once the church was full usually remained to listen to the service through the windows.45
 established Church of England that mourned and celebrated the royals. From Victoria’s funeral to the coronation of Elizabeth II, special services were held by every denomination imaginable, from Methodists, Presbyterians, and Roman Catholics, to Baptists, Moravians, the Salvation Army, and the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church. Semi-religious organizations such as the Masons and the Odd-Fellows also held services for royal occasions, as did non-Christian religious groups such as those in the Jewish and Hindu communities. Like the ceremonies in Anglican churches, these services drew huge and diverse crowds, and the extensive reports about them in the local papers would have reached a large cross-section of the Jamaican population. It is hardly surprising that large numbers of Jamaicans took the opportunity to participate in the enjoyable activities such as horse races, fairs or watching fireworks that went along with many royal occasions. But that they also participated, in great numbers, in events that were not necessarily entertaining in and of themselves suggests a deep loyalty to the British royals. Given a day off from work to mourn Victoria’s death, many Jamaicans chose to do just that, spending much of the day participating in religious services in memory of their queen. While their duty as faithful churchgoers likely played a role in their eagerness to attend royal religious services, Jamaicans also appeared in great numbers—and waited for considerable periods—at tedious civic events such as proclamation ceremonies. Jamaicans could get quite testy when they felt they had been excluded from royal occasions—as in 1911 when local newspapers received a barrage of complaints about the poor advertising to the general public of George V’s proclam- ation ceremony. These criticisms were recalled in 1936 by the then governor, Sir Edward B. Denham, who took care to publicly and specifically invite all islanders to the Kingston proclamation of Edward VIII. Some 15,000 persons chose to attend, and photographs indicate that the majority of them were persons of color.47

 Throughout its existence the organization highlighted ‘Negro’ achievements and explored African history and culture in its articles while calling for equality for all ‘coloured’ colonials. In contrast, the explicitly Christian approach of the organization seems to have caused little internal strife. As David Killingray has rightly pointed out, Christianity was the ‘mainspring’ of Harold Moody’s life and integral to the League he designed.32 It was also typical of middle-class West Indians. Moody himself had been a devout Christian from his early youth in Jamaica, and in Britain he was heavily involved in religious activities as a leader in the Congregational Church and various missionary organizations. The League’s office was, for some time, located in the Camberwell Green Congregational Church building, and for years the organ- ization held an annual religious service at the same church.33

But the characteristic contribution of Maryland to  the' English colonisation was the frank acceptance of toleration  in religious opinions. Lord Baltimore was a Catholic, and in  Maryland Catholics and Protestants lived in a harmony un­ known to the Old World.

 face, in middle life, the hardships of a pioneer in New England.  He and his companions were alike Puritans, drawn mainly  from the Eastern counties, and it was not concealed that  settlers of milder views would find scant welcom~.

 THE LOSS OF THE AMERICAN COLONIES.
 I. The chief of these lay in the origin and history of the  colonies themselves. The colonists were, as we have seen,  above all things Englishmen, With the political tenacity and  individual reliance of their race. In fighting George III.,  New England at least felt itself once more resisting the  tyranny of the Stuarts. Moreover, thanks to their long training  in self-government in Church and State, and to their steady  prosperity, the colonial communities were, politically, far more  intelligent apd advanced than the mother country, and their  leaders were conscious of it.

 The Catholic Church had, as we have seen, proved itself not  a. The Ro- merely a religious but a political power in Canada.
 The second period of Canadian history begins with the  Quebec Act of 1774. By this Act Roman Second Catholicism was recognised as the religion of the   period of Anglo-Cana­colony, and the parochial clergy were allowed dian rule: the  to "hold, receive and enjoy their accustomed Quebec Act, 1774·dues and rights, with respect to such persons  only as shall profess the said religion." In civil matters the  existing French law was continued in force; criminal charges  were to be decided by an English code. Colonial government  was, as before, to be administered by a . nominated Council.  English opinion could not then rise to the idea of a legislative  Assembly which must be, under the circumstances, exclusively  Catholic. England, as we know, admitted toleration in the  colonies long in advance of its recognition at home; but the The Loyalist Immigration. [CH. VIII.
 The constitution of 1791 was, however, the first step towards  colonial autonomy. It preserved the rights previously conceded  to the French population and placed the English settlers in an  equal position with them. Upper Canada could thus protect  its Protestant worship, support its clergy, and adopt a system  of freehold land-tenure; and this it proceeded to do. Lower  Canada retained, with its French language, its own civil and  religious institutions. England in this way recognized that  Canada contained two nations, which could not as yet amalga­ mate; and devised a constitution to meet their distinctive  needs.
 But the colonial authorities at home, reflecting perhaps  Reversal of English Liberal opinion as a whole, were at the Kaffir this time (1836) averse to any measures which  Settlement, 1836. seemed to increase British responsibilities.

 In Upper Canada the British population, strongly reinforced by the  infusion of Loyalists after the American Revolution, claimed that they  should have a monopoly of control over the administration: by the 1820s  their leaders formed a clique, called the 'Family Compact', which sought  to manage all patronage and persuade the governors that they alone  must constitute the executive council. They dismissed more recent set- tlers as interlopers, to be excluded from power and privilege. There was  also a dispute over the system of allocating the reserve lands of the prov- ince, which the British Crown controlled. Land reserved for ecclesiast- ical purposes was restricted to the use of the Anglican Church; yet  dissenters, including Methodists and Scots Presbyterians, pointed out  that they were more numerous than Anglicans, and that the lands allo- cated to the Church of England were not put to use, and were a barrier  to communications. Large tracts of land were secured by the Family  Compact and left vacant for speculative purposes. But the opponents  of the Family Compact were divided amongst themselves, with the  Methodists splitting into reformers and anti-reformers, which some crit- ics alleged was because Methodists were benefiting from government  grants. 21
 Durham's report revealed the flaws arising from his hurried visit. He  set aside the constitutional questions, and underestimated the internal  tensions within the English people in Canada, whose religious divisions  he hardly understood. Instead he concentrated on the clash of national- ities, declaring that the question was one of institutions, 'laws and cus- toms as are of French origin, which the British have sought to outlaw,  and the Canadians have sought to preserve'. 34 This ignored the possibil- ity that, had the inhabitants of Lower Canada been exclusively English,  then they might have tried their strength against the British Govern- ment as did the Americans in the 1760s and 1770s. 35 Durham hardly men- tioned Upper Canada, where there were serious difficulties between  the Legislature and the local oligarchy which controlled the executive  and legislative Councils, and some reformers in the Assembly even advocated the American principle of an elective Upper House. 36 There  was even the American religious parallel, for most of the oligarchy in  Upper Canada was Anglican in religion. Governors sought to support  an Anglican establishment and secure for the church all the privileges of  an establishment, but the majority of the province's inhabitants were  Dissenters, with an eye to clipping the wings of the Anglican Church.37
 The loss of empire, the contraction of England, were forecast by John  Morley in his review of Seeley's Expansion of England in 1884. Morley  argued strongly against the idea of imperial federation and customs  union. The question was 'simply whether the good of the members of  our great English union all over the world will be best promoted by  aiming at artificial centralisation, or by leaving as much room as possible  for the expansion of individual communities along lines and in channels  which they spontaneously cut out for themselves'. 35 But it was all less  traumatic than it might have been, partly because there existed a tradi- tion to which Morley's ideas belonged, which acted as a facilitator of  British withdrawal from empire. As Norman Stone (a Scottish observer  of English mores) put it, 'Europe modernized through the state and  much time and not a little blood was expended in fighting about institu- tions. The English just took institutions and made them do something  else.' 36
 The Royal Commission marked the end of an era. In the twentieth century the old anti-opium movement, characterised by Protestant religious affiliations and following in the footsteps of other evangelical reform movements such as the anti-slavery campaign, would gradually be replaced by an international control system characterised by inter- national negotiation and compromise.

 The intensification of cultural contact in the Pacific from the 1760s modified this pattern. In the central Pacific, Europeans established sus- tained relationships with a range of Polynesian societies that had developed hierarchical forms of political organization, consolidated important divisions of labour and elaborated complex sequences of ritual performances. These communities could not easily be dismissed as mere ‘savages’ lacking religion, rather the structured nature of their polities and their strong interest in trade suggested that they possessed a significant degree of cultural sophistication. Most importantly, it seemed that they were religious and in an Enlightenment Europe where orthodox theologians, deists and anti-Church philosophes were concerned with religious diversity, the ‘natural’ religions of the Pacific were of special interest.
 But in terms of social function, the two systems were similar in that they preserved the powers of the elite groups (or racial groups in India) in society, by establishing a code of ‘no-touchism’ that protected the sanctity and power of the elites from the defiling touch of the ordinary person. In both societies, these conventions, backed by the sanction  of religious authority, provided the key socio-religious structure that governed everyday life.99
 The intensely sectarian programmes of the missionaries undoubt- edly deepened these tensions. Both Wesleyan and Anglican missionar- ies drew on pre-existing Maori resentment of the French to launch anti-Catholic campaigns which were heavily reliant on print.66 In response to the establishment of the Catholic mission the CMS pro- duced Te Anakaraiti (‘The Anti-Christ’), a pamphlet labelling the Pope the Anti-Christ. This was quickly followed by two more anti-Catholic pamphlets, in the form of dialogues between Rapu Pono (Searcher for Truth) and Aroha Pono (True Love), which detailed twelve ‘errors’ of the Catholic Church.67 As a result of this anti-Catholic propaganda, Maori routinely called Jean-Baptiste Pompallier, the Catholic Bishop, the ‘Anti-Christ’.68 Pompallier reflected that the Catholic missionaries armed with ‘only our voices and our pens’ struggled as ‘heresy [i.e. the Protestant missions] had two printing presses at its command’, which allowed both the Anglicans and the Wesleyans to circulate ‘pam- phlets, tracts, and little books, which while teaching the first truths of salvation, were filled with all sorts of objections and calumnies against  the minister and the faith of the Catholic Church.’69 When W. B. Ullathorne, the English Catholic Vicar-General of Australia, visited New Zealand in 1840 to dispel the Maori belief that only the French were Catholics, he discovered that the Protestant missionaries had not only told Maori ‘fantastic stories of the old anti-Catholic type’, but that these anti-Catholic tales had been further sensationalized ‘for  the New Zealand palate’.70 But Maori were not passive pawns in a European sectarian battle fought on New Zealand soil, as they exploited these sectarian tensions by playing on Protestant fears of ‘Popery’ to demand more frequent visits from missionaries and easier access to baptism.71

 God’s Empire In  God’s Empire , Hilary M. Carey charts Britain’s nineteenth- century  transformation from Protestant nation to free Christian empire  through the history of the colonial missionary movement. This  wide-ranging reassessment of the religious character of the second  British empire provides a clear account of the promotional strategies  of the major churches and church parties which worked to plant set- tler Christianity in British domains. Based on extensive use of ori- ginal archival and rare published sources, the author explores major  debates such as the relationship between religion and colonisation,  Church–state relations, Irish Catholics in the empire, the impact of  the Scottish Disruption on colonial Presbyterianism, and competi- tion between Evangelicals and other Anglicans in the colonies, and  between British and American strands of Methodism in British North  America.

 As heirs to the legacy of the British empire, British prime ministers  have been divided on the need to give an account of their moral stew- ardship. In 2007, Tony Blair apologised on the 200th anniversary of  the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade; others said the time for apolo- gies was past.  1   In the former colonies, there is also a mixed picture.  While former Prime Minister John Howard refused to make any apol- ogy to the Australian Aborigines on the ground that his administration  had played no role in their original colonisation and dispossession, his  successor made an official apology to the ‘stolen generations’ one of  his first acts on coming to power. Along with church leaders of many  denominations, Pope Benedict XVI would appear to side with the apol- ogisers, and, in May 2007, reflecting on his visit to Brazil, he lamented  the injustice that had often accompanied Christian missions.
 So why does the mere idea of empire now attract division when, a  little over a hundred years ago, imperial church gatherings, such as the  Pan-Anglican Congress of 1908 (discussed in the final chapter) capti- vated the London metropole?
 This book sets out to answer this question from a particular point of  view – that of the colonial missionary movement. It examines a set of  ideas that rose and fell with the mass flow of people from Great Britain  and Ireland to colonies in British North America, Australia, New  Zealand and southern Africa in the nineteenth century. It concerns the  institutions which were created by the churches to support the dias- pora, including the colonial committees, colonial missionary societies, Preface and acknowledgments 1     P.

 Preface and acknowledgmentsxiv missionary colleges, missionary periodicals, and memoirs published by  colonial clergy in their retirement. It was a large movement, even if it  was not so large as either the foreign missionary movement, or those  moral and humanitarian campaigns, including anti-slavery, temper- ance and labour reform, which also engaged the British churches at  about the same time. Colonial missions were conservative: they helped  to sustain bonds of allegiance and unite them in what they perceived to  be a great spiritual and moral enterprise. However, they also helped to  perpetuate the old animosities between Protestant and Catholic, estab- lished and Free Church, liberal and conservative, that had character- ised churches in Britain.
 Colonial churches therefore laboured under a double burden. They  were central signifiers of older religious nationalisms, sectarianism and  ethnicities, even as these things were breaking down under the multiple  impacts of constitutional reform, emigration, colonisation and nation- building. At the same time, they were required to nurture the more tol- erant, liberal and democratic values, which included the absence of an  established Church and hereditary privilege, which would eventually  be seen as hallmarks of the new Britains of the second British empire.  Indeed, if they were to survive and meet the needs of new nations,  rather than their home congregations in England, Scotland, Ireland  and Wales, colonial missions had to sow the seeds of national churches  in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and other former  settler colonies.
 The structure of this book generally follows a chronological trajec- tory though there are many thematic meanderings along the way. The  first section begins by defining some terms and providing a survey of  the major events which impacted on the religious affairs of the colonies Preface and acknowledgments xv in the nineteenth century. The second section, on colonial missions,  is divided between Anglicans, Catholics, Evangelical Anglicans,  Nonconformists and Presbyterians, and gives an account of all the major  colonial missionary societies: the (Anglican) Society for the Propagation  of the Gospel (SPG), the (Catholic) Association for the Propagation of  the Faith (APF), the (Evangelical Anglican) Colonial and Continental  Missionary Society (CCMS), the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary  Society   (WMMS), the (Congregationalist) Colonial Church Society  (CCS) and the Colonial Schemes of the Free and established Church  of Scotland. Since, apart from the SPG, most of these societies have  not had the benefit of their own individual scholarly histories, this has  required quite a lot of narrative compression of the printed and archival  sources. It also led to some chronological overlap, but it did seem to  make the best sense to follow this arrangement so I stuck with it. The  third section concerns the colonial clergy – or at least their training in  the two colleges that were specifically set up for this purpose in Ireland  and England. There were others in the colonies, as well as the Irish  College in Rome, which performed similar work; however, I have had  less to say about them. The final section takes the colonial missionary  movement to the promised lands of colonial settlement and looks at  religious schemes of colonisation, especially those to New Zealand, and  the controversy aroused by Edward Gibbon Wakefield and his theory of  systematic colonisation. It concludes with the Britannia or Barr colony,  which was established in Saskatchewan during the last great imperial  land boom in the Canadian wheat lands of the northwest.
 Preface and acknowledgmentsxvi new arrivals from around the globe have changed other imperial cities  beyond recognition, the overall religious mix in Newcastle continues to  preserve something of the character of its founding British churches.  I have found it a good place to reflect on the complexities of the post- colonial world, in which cities, nations, churches and their people have  been energetic in reinventing themselves and turning their backs on the  imperial past.

 Part I Greater Britain – the English-speaking settler colonies of the British  empire which we are more likely now to refer to as the British world   – was  an idea as much as a set of territories.  1   For the free Christian churches of  the peoples of Great Britain and Ireland, it was also a mission field. This  is a novel idea and one which I hope to argue throughout the course of  this book.  Chapter 1  begins by examining the idea of Greater Britain  ,  first as a concept in the writing of Charles Wentworth Dilke (1843– 1911),   and then as it was taken up by the churches who adopted the term  as their own in the last decades of the nineteenth century. It also intro- duces topics raised in subsequent chapters which examine the arrange- ments and organisations that were marshalled across the empire in order  to provide religious services for colonists. In subsequent  chapters, this  book considers the development of missions to British settlers,  including  the colonial missionary societies ( Chapters 3  to  7 ),  missionary training  colleges for colonial clergy ( Chapters 8  to  10 ), church emigration soci- eties ( Chapter 10 ), and Christian colonisation ( Chapters 11  and  12 ).  Together, these provisions for the colonial churches helped shape the  powerful, shared sense of British identity that suffused the British world  and to which Dilke was able to give a name.
 At one level, Clifford’s enraptured sermon offers transparent and enthu- siastic endorsement for British, and indeed for specifically English,  imperialism. However, religious rhetoric needs to be carefully decon- structed, and it must be emphasised that Clifford’s enthusiasm was  reserved for a religious rather than a political empire, though clearly he  saw no real conflict between the two.
 In the late nineteenth century, Nonconformists such as Clifford were  among the many enthusiastic advocates of the cultural promise of the  English-speaking lands of the British empire. For all the churches, the  empire created opportunities for the   construction of transnational spir- itual networks that aimed to transcend the cultural constraints and  legal proscriptions of the past. Like Clifford, Anglicans, Catholics and  other Nonconformists were keen to take advantage of the empire to  extend the geographical and spiritual boundaries of their churches. John  Wolffe   has suggested that religious leaders expressed this awareness of  the British world through events such as the Lambeth Conferences,  which called Anglican bishops from throughout the world to assemble  in London every ten years beginning in 1867, as well as travel by church  delegations.  6   At the close of the century, many Protestant churches held  their own worldwide meetings   in Britain, which drew delegates from  Australasia, Canada, Asia, America and Africa, and encouraged  similar  aspirations.  7   For Catholics, the nineteenth International Eucharistic 3      Ibid ., p. 22.     4      Ibid ., p. 144.    5      Ibid ., p. 167.     6     J. Wolffe,  God and Greater Britain: Religion and National Life in Britain and Ireland, 1843–1945  (London, 1994), p. 220. For Nonconformist   enthusiasm for empire, see  J. Cox, ‘Were Victorian Nonconformists the Worst Imperialists of All?’,  Victorian  Studies , 46 (2004), pp. 243–55.
 The common Christianity which suffused Greater Britain   was, for  the most part, assumed to be a ‘generic’ Protestantism, which encom- passed imperial loyalty and the celebration of uniquely British (or  Anglo-Saxon) virtues of freedom, tolerance, justice and civic duty.  9   In  this modified form, it continued earlier visions of Britain as a Protestant  nation heroically resisting the Catholic menace of Spain, France and  Ireland, which Linda Colley  , in an influential thesis, has suggested  was integral to the British state forged in the eighteenth century.  10    The Evangelical Anglicans who founded the Colonial and Continental  Church Society  , considered in  Chapter 5 , were so entranced by the idea  of Greater Britain that they incorporated the term in the title of their  journal, the  Greater Britain Messenger   . In 1876, the following poem was  recited at the close of a sermon delivered on behalf of the Colonial and  Continental Church Society, in the hope that it would inspire listeners  to respond to the religious needs of colonists: Rest not! but heed thy brother’s cry of anguish   For ‘living bread’ across the stormy sea.   Shall famished souls in ‘Greater Britain’ languish   When God has sent His messengers to thee?
 Though directed at an Evangelical Anglican rather than a Baptist audi- ence, this poem sums up sentiments that are similar to those expressed and Bournemouth (1930). The equivalent meetings of the Church of England included  the Lambeth Conferences   of bishops (from 1867), the Missionary Conferences   of  the Anglican Communion (1894) and, subsequently, the Pan-Anglican Conference    (1908); the Methodists gathered in 1881 (London), 1891 (Washington) and 1901  (London); the first Baptist World Congress   was held in London in 1905.
 Greater Britain   was one solution to the problem created by British  expansion in the second half of the nineteenth century – how to shape  a national identity in the absence of a convincing internal or exter- nal Catholic threat. While ‘Protestant Britain’ had been an effective  vehicle for a warrior island state, it was of less use in the changed  conditions of the post-Napoleonic world in which religious divisions  were an impediment to good order and government. In the British  empire, multiple rather than unitary nationalism became the norm  and Britishness supplied a new overarching identity that supple- mented rather than supplanted older ethnic and religious loyalties.  The Britishness encapsulated in the term ‘Greater Britain’ was all the  more effective as a vehicle for colonial identity because it provided  nationalism without government or religious establishment (though  some people had aspirations in this direction).  23
 in modern secular states, religion and nation are constantly interact- ing with one another in multiple ways and should never be considered  isolated  phenomena.  26   Adrian Hastings   came closer to the mark when  he argued that religion, like language, was a component of all national- isms.  27   This was true for Greater Britain   as it was for earlier imagined  communities of the peoples of the Atlantic World. Throughout British  North America, Australia  , New Zealand   and southern Africa, the set- tler churches carried with them the burden and aspirations of the fused  ethnic and religious communities of their home societies. In these new  Britains, older religious ethnicities     did not entirely disappear; rather,  under the imperial umbrella, the churches accommodated English  Anglicanism, Welsh Nonconformity, Irish   Catholicism or Scottish and  Irish Presbyterianism, in modified forms.  28   In general, the sort of reli- gious nationalism promoted through events such as the feasts of the  patron saints of England, Scotland or Ireland was thoroughly sanitised  before being endorsed by the churches for consumption by the faithful.  However, it was one of the mechanisms through which British imperial- ism continued to sustain a dialogue with its Christian and ethnic roots  in Great Britain and Ireland.
 Defining the religious character of Greater Britain   more precisely  than this is something of a challenge. However, unlike Britons in the  eighteenth century, Greater Britons in the new century tended to define  themselves less by their belligerent Protestantism than by their religious  toleration and love of liberty. Just as Great Britain had freed her slaves,  so she had granted full rights of citizenship to Catholics, Jews and  Nonconformists. The ending of war with France also defused tensions  which demonised the Catholic ‘Other’ and aggravated sectarian hostil- ity at home. It was also significant that, as the British empire expanded,  it incorporated more and more non-Christians while providing ample  opportunities for Scots, Welsh and Anglo-Irish of all faiths to partici- pate and prosper.  29   Even the despised colonial Irish could be redefined  as part of the white, Christian ruling class in opposition to the sub- ject heathen races of India, Africa and Asia.  30   This involved significant 26     For examples, see Michael Jeismann, ‘Nation, Identity and Enmity’, in  What Is a  Nation?: Europe 1789–1914 , ed.

Ignatiev,  How the Irish Became White  (London, 1995). For the realignment of earlier animosities, notably those between Catholics   and  conservative Protestants. However, in adjusting its religious character,  Greater Britain followed the same trajectory as that of civil religion in  America. In his witty and insightful essays on religious nationalism,  Conor Cruise O’Brien   suggested that American civil religion   trans- muted from ‘pan-Protestant’ to ‘pan-Christian’ in the interval between  the American Civil War and the late twentieth century so that it even- tually embraced Catholics such as Senator Joseph McCarthy  .  31   Wryly,  he observed that in the 1950s Americans ‘discovered that the Antichrist  had changed his address, moving from the Vatican to the Kremlin’.  32
 While the generation of a powerful common enemy was essential to  the reorientation of religious nationalism in America, in the United  Kingdom political change paved the way much earlier. Following  the constitutional revolution  , which included the passage of the Test  and Corporation Acts   (1828), Catholic Emancipation   (1829) and the  Reform Act (1832)   at home, and the passage of the New South Wales  Church Act (1836)   and the secularisation of the Canadian clergy  reserves   (1854) in the colonies, there was a radical change to the stand- ing of the Church of England and the Church of Scotland, which had  previously dominated the political and religious union of Great Britain  and Ireland. Mandler argues that a new understanding of the English  national character emerged in the 1830s, one which reflected a religious  consensus which was not linked to a specific church and was more tol- erant, earnest and pluralist than any in the old regime.  33   In 1851, the  death knell of Britain as a Protestant nation was popularly believed to  have been tolled with the erection of an English Catholic hierarchy.  The ensuing moral panic reflected a seismic shift in the standing of the  Catholic Church in Britain. The shift was even more marked overseas.  In Greater Britain  , there would be neither official Protestantism nor  Church establishment, but neither would there be, as in the American  republic, a free marketplace for all denominations.
 already expressing serious reservations about the divinity of Christ and  he was never a believer in British engagement in missionary work.  34    Yet, despite his personal religious reservations, he did not question  the centrality of the churches to the cultural fabric of the empire, and  he commented on religious matters shrewdly and thoroughly. Issues  which concerned him included the status of Catholicism in regions  with high Catholic emigration from Ireland, the influence of mission- aries on native populations, and the colonial standing of the Church  of England in the wake of the removal of the props provided by estab- lishment. In Canada, he expressed anxiety about the rapid increase  of the Irish Catholic   population and the threat this posed to British  Protestantism. Without stating his sources, he stated that the ‘Fenians  ’  (radical Irish republicans) were ‘strong’ in Toronto and ‘not unknown’  even in Montreal. However, he confidently predicted that the Dominion  would be saved from a Catholic established church because of the lack  of union between French and Irish Catholics.  35   In New Zealand  , he  reflected settler hostility to the influence of missionaries and declared  that the ‘Maori   Church of Englandism’, introduced by the CMS, was a  failure.  36   In Australia  , he noted the strength of Nonconformity, observ- ing that the Wesleyans, Catholics and Presbyterians were stronger than  other denominations (presumably he was thinking especially of the  Church of England). Greater   Britain was also more religiously diverse  than he seems to have anticipated. In Melbourne he noted the incon- gruity, to his eyes, of the jostling together of religious buildings, where  the Wesleyan church, the Chinese joss house and the Catholic cath- edral stood in close proximity.  37
 Dilke tackled the thorny issue of colonial church establishment in the  book that he produced as a sequel to his original survey.  38   He pointed  out that many colonies had either never had an established Church, or  had chosen to abolish it together with any ongoing financial assistance  for religious purposes. Overall, he was fascinated by what the potential  consequences of this might be.  39   The impact of colonial disestablish- ment was also of interest to the novelist Anthony Trollope (1815–82),    who visited New Zealand   and the Australian colonies from 1871 to  1872. With some amazement, Trollope observed: ‘every branch of  the Christian religion is now supposed to stand on equal footing, and  to have an equal title to whatever support the State may be able and 34     Gwynn and Tuckwell,  Charles W. Dilke , vol. 1, p. 61. Dilke was pious as a young man,  and, on at least one occasion (21 January 1883), he attended church with Gladstone.  See Gwynn and Tuckwell,  Charles W. Dilke , vol. 1, p. 514.
 willing to give.’  40   Neither Dilke nor Trollope speculated on the polit- ical effects of Church disestablishment, though Dilke suggested that  it ensured that the colonies were less marked by sectarian divisions.  41    At the same time, Dilke condemned colonial governors who stirred  up rivalries about ecclesiastical precedence and gave his approval to  Cardinal Moran, the Catholic archbishop of Sydney, for objecting to  the attempt to give precedence to the Anglican bishop of Sydney, Dr  Alfred Barry  .  42   In his view, the privileges of the Church of England  were something which should be left behind once British settlers had  created their own societies beyond British shores.
 Nonconformists were in no doubt that the lack of establishment  increased rather than decreased the loyalty of the British people in  the colonies. They were also aware that it opened up the field to other  churches. In 1913, when the theologian Walter Frederick Adeney    (1849–1920), former principal of Lancashire Independent College, led  a visit to Congregationalist   churches in Canada  , New South Wales  ,  New Zealand   and southern Africa  , his activities were promoted as ‘the  day of opportunity for Colonial Missions’.  43   This optimistic view is in  marked contrast to those expressed by the first Congregationalist   dele- gation to visit the colonies, which was undertaken by Daniel Tyerman  and George Bennet   for the London Missionary Society  . From 1821  to 1829, they toured the Society’s stations in the South Pacific, Java,  China, India, Africa and Madagascar, suggesting plans for the future –  plans which did not include missions to colonists.  44   On Adeney’s visit,  the Congregationalist   magazine,  British Missionary , called for generous  support for ‘the cause of Christ in the British empire’, reflecting that  ‘Christians in the Homeland … have no adequate conception of the  spiritual destitution of t  housands of our fellow-countrymen scattered  throughout Greater Britain  ’.    45
 In ways such as this, Dilke’s terminology was embraced by the colonial  missionary societies and used to extend their aspirations for a Christian  empire in which all the churches would have fair and equal representa- tion. While class continued to divide Britons at home, across the seas 40     A. Trollope,  Australia and New Zealand , 2 vols.

Moran’s example was later recalled by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland when he gave ecclesiastical precedence to the Catholic archbishop of Dublin, Cardinal Paul  Cullen, at official events in Dublin Castle. I thank Dr Colin Barr for bringing this to  my attention.
 Yet missionaries were only one aspect of the religious character of  the empire. Besides giving support to missions and the moral uplift  of native people, religious people with access to power promoted the  idea that the British empire should itself be subject to moral govern- ance. The churches provided important ideological support for imper- ial expansion. They generally regarded the empire as a force for good,  and missionaries facilitated the extension of its boundaries even if  they opposed colonial settlement in some circumstances, notably New  Zealand  .
 Overall, it is probably better to consider colonisation as one phase  in a series of imperial encounters which might begin with first con- tact, progress through engagement with temporary travellers, pioneers  and beachcombers, and which might include colonial settlement as one  stage of a broader imperial engagement. The churches were engaged  with the progress of colonisation in all its phases. Chaplains, mission- aries and bush parsons arrived as pioneers; bishops, and missionary  and colonial church societies succeeded them and planted churches;  they were often the first on new frontiers and the ones with the great- est call on resources from home to sustain their supply lines. While  they never stopped complaining about the need for more money and  personnel, the churches had distinct advantages over other imperial  institutions. There was intense competition between them for colonial  territory: Catholics competed with Protestants; Methodists competed  with Anglicans and secured an effective alliance with Presbyterians  and other Nonconformists; church parties and sects struggled with  each other, and different ethnic churches had competing claims to  the same people. Nevertheless, they could also draw on local sources  of income and many clerical personnel, male and female, were pre- pared to work for very low wages. They rapidly adapted to new colo- nial  conditions and became important players in colonial nationalist   movements. They formed strategic alliances with the political parties  that emerged in the fledgling colonial democracies: Anglicans with  the conservatives, Nonconformists with liberals and Catholics in the  labour movement. For the churches, moreover, colonialism continued  well after the departure of more overt institutions of imperial power,  such as the British army, navy and colonial administration.  60
 For the millions who participated in the great British  Völkerwanderung   of the Victorian era, the churches were among the most pervasive and  enduring cultural institutions that the emigrant English, Irish and Scots  chose to transplant and rear in colonial soil. To staff the new churches  required a clerical army to be despatched by the various colonial missions  set up by the churches for this purpose. Despite the scale of this project, 7 Millions 6    ” 5    ” 4    ” 3    ” 2    ” 1    ” 18 51
 the churches aimed to ensure that they left no frontier unattended by spir- itual ministers; astonishingly, by the time of the imperial census in 1901,  it was reported that the proportion of clergy to population throughout  the settler colonies was more or less the same as it was in Britain itself.  66    In  Chapters 3  to  7 , I will try to make a direct calculation of the scale of  investment that this represented for the different churches. However, by  any measure it was a weighty and globally significant event.
 There has been increasing interest in the role played by religion in differ- ent phases of British overseas expansion.  67   However, the bulk of published  work has concentrated on the role of missionaries in those parts of the  empire where British settlers remained in the minority.  68   As Porter   notes,  there are now three voluminous – but largely independent – bodies of  historiography with which imperial religious historians must engage: the  history of missions, the secular history of the British empire, and the  autonomous histories of the national churches planted in the wake of mis- sionary or colonial settlement.  69   There is also an ongoing debate about  the relationship between religion and imperialism, especially the extent to  which missionaries ought to carry responsibility for the ongoing impact  of European empires in the developing world.  70   Yet, in all this, the settler  churches have tended to disappear as an object of study.
 history as there are on colonial church history. Secular imperial history  has also changed its emphasis. Older survey histories of British settle- ment such as Carrington  ’s gave generous coverage to religious ques- tions; Carrington also wrote a biography of John Robert Godley, the  leader of the Canterbury settlement, which is considered in  Chapter 11 .  72    An appreciation of the relevance of ecclesiastical history to the study  of the empire was also axiomatic for pro-imperialists such as Jose, even  though he regarded the churches and their missionaries as an impedi- ment to settler ambitions.  73   However, the new multi-volume histories  of the British empire tend to leave it out almost entirely, something  unthinkable to an earlier generation.
 planted as much by missionaries as the colonial churches. However,  whiteness was the majority condition of British settler societies and,  as Patrick Wolfe   has argued, since settlers ‘came to stay’ they tended  inevitably – regardless of good intentions and Christian principles – to  be both genocidal and monocultural.  80
 The principal difficulty with adopting Fanon’s   uncompromising  model of colonialism is that it assumes there was a binary relationship  between colonisers and colonised, and between the metropole and per- iphery. This has considerable polemical force, but it rarely corresponds  to the messy arrangements that characterised both the frontier and its  aftermath. The difficulties increase in the case of cultural institutions  such as the churches. While most churches employed rhetoric that  boosted Anglo-Saxon and British virtues at the expense of heathens  and pagans, the argument that all colonial religions were therefore vehi- cles for British cultural hegemony is not sustainable. A simple tool such  as the census data on religion in the colonies of British settlement can  illustrate the complexities of the interaction between race, mission and  Church in colonies of British settlement.  89   In many colonies, including  the West Indies  , Cape Colony   and New Zealand  , church membership  was strongly differentiated by race and, where this can be measured,  class and occupation. In Cape Colony in 1898, for example, while no  church was exclusively white or black, the majority Dutch Reformed  Church   (NGK), which made up 31.3 per cent of the total population,  held over 60 per cent of the white population but less than 7 per cent  of the ‘coloured’ (as this was defined by the census).  90   On the other  hand, the Methodist Church  , which was the NGK’s main rival in terms  of adherents, held the majority of the coloured population (52.8 per  cent). There are also striking variables in the denominational adher- ence of the Dutch and the British settler people, reflecting profound  cultural divisions between these colonial populations in the Cape. The  churches, in other words, rapidly adjusted to the local conditions and  became engaged on both sides of the frontier.
 It is also important to avoid the assumption that white settlers formed  a cohesive cultural bloc. This was rarely the case – to the perennial dis- may of Christian leaders. Division took many forms, some imported from  the old world, others manufactured in the crucible of the new. The long- standing struggle between ‘imperial Anglicanism’ and Nonconformity,  which is so marked a feature of the religious politics of the American 88     For whiteness   and religion in associated with racial prejudice, see E. J. Blum,  Reforging  the White Republic: Race, Religion, and American Nationalism, 1865–1898  (Baton Rouge,  LA, 2005); M. F. Brewer,  Staging Whiteness  (Hanover, NH, 2005), p. 4.
 colonies in the eighteenth century, takes new forms in the nineteenth  as state subsidies to the Church of England were reduced or abol- ished.  91   According to Vaudry, the character of Canadian Anglicanism  was influenced by Irish Evangelicalism, especially in Quebec, as well  as the numerical importance of both French and Irish Catholicism  .  92    American and English rivalries played an important role in the develop- ment of Methodism in Canada, as we will see in  Chapter 6 . While Irish  Catholicism   was to triumph in much of the English-speaking empire,  this was achieved at the expense of English Catholicism in Australi  a  and New Zealand  , and was limited by French Catholicism   in British  North America. In the latter, the separate spheres of Francophone and  Anglophone Catholicism ensured that, even though in 1901 Catholics  made up 41 per cent of the Canadian population, they were unable to  translate this demographic into a united Catholic voice on political and  social issues. For all the churches, factors such as their relationship  to the state, the scale and ethnic character of emigration, the charac- ter of the resident European and native populations, and interaction  with other churches, ensured that the culture and politics of the local  churches differed both from each other and from the churches at home.  In short, it was never a simple case of ‘us’ and ‘them’.
 While it is a term that is too convenient to discard, ‘religion’ is not  an especially helpful category of historical analysis for British imperial  history. We must talk instead about churches and their ethnic and pol- itical character as well as the way in which these porous and malleable  institutions were adapted to their colonial setting. Colonial religious  institutions also change over time. In the first British empire, the estab- lished churches were part of the imperial state, but this relationship  was slowly dismantled in the course of the nineteenth century to be  replaced with something quite different. As historians such as Robert  Grant   have stressed, the churches need to be considered along with  writers, artists and cultural agents who played their parts in ‘imagin- ing the empire’.  93   The empire in these formulations had its political, 91     For aspects of ‘imperial’ Anglicanism, see P.

 Religion and the settler empire A disparate coalition of thinkers contributed to the creation of a reli- gious model of the British settler empire.  94   In the early part of the nine- teenth century, this included those radical conservatives who were  sufficiently rattled by the French Revolution to propose a return to  the verities of the old religion. Chief among these was Samuel Taylor  Coleridge   (1772–1834) who argued that a ‘national   Church’ could pro- vide an essential spiritual dimension to the state, an idea that was read- ily extended beyond Britain’s island boundaries.  95   He also proposed that  the ‘Clerisy   of the nation, or national   Church’ originally included ‘the  learned of all denominations’.  96   In the 1830s, Coleridge’s ideas about  the religious character of the British state and its intellectuals were  taken up and developed by the educator Thomas Arnold   (1795–1842),  who promoted the idea of civil service at home and abroad as both mis- sion and patriotic duty.  97   W. E. Gladstone   and his circle did the most  to advocate the idea of the national Church as an ideal for Britain and  her colonies, a political vision we can trace through the creation of the  Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund   (1841) and beyond. It permeates much of his  thinking about the ‘English-speaking people’, which was for Gladstone    as much a cultural and religious as a political ideal.  98
 Unsurprisingly, the Society for Propagation of the Gospel (SPG  ),  the oldest missionary organisation of the Church of England, had the  clearest idea of Greater Britain   as a field of spiritual labour. This was  expressed over many years in the annual sermons and publications of  the societies and their benefactors,  99   but there were a number of more 94     For the debate about the non-settler empire, see, for example, Wolffe,  God and Greater  Britain , ch. 8.
 99     For the Ramsden sermons, which have been delivered annually in Oxford or Cambridge  since 1847 on the theme ‘Church extension in the colonies and dependencies of ambitious attempts to write the complete spiritual history of the empire.  In 1900–1, G. Robert Wynne   (1838–c.1906), archdeacon of Aghadoe  and canon of St Patrick’s cathedral, presented the Donnellan Lectures  at Trinity College Dublin on the theme: ‘The Church in Greater  Britain’.  100   This was highly recommended to all ‘Christian Imperialists’  by the  Church of Ireland Gazette  which suggests something about its tar- get audience.  101   The lectures themselves were not very distinguished;  they consist mostly of potted summaries of the histories of the Church  of England and the SPG, and Wynne does not bother to explain what  he means by Greater Britain except that it refers to ‘the subject of the  planting and growth of the Colonial Church among our countrymen  abroad, and among the various heathen tribes with which they are  brought in contact’.  102   In the event, the lectures cover early missions  from the British Isles, with subsequent chapters on the American col- onies, Canada, Australia  , New Zealand  , the West Indies   and South    Africa, and ‘lesser colonial possessions’ including British Honduras,  Bermuda, Fiji, British New Guinea, West Africa, the East and Central  African Protectorate, Mauritius, Ascension, the Straits Settlement  and Hong Kong, with a quick mention of the work of the bishop of  Jerusalem who had oversight over Anglican clergy and missionary work  in the Holy Land and Egypt, and, in South America, the bishop of the  Falkland Islands and the bishop of Argentina. By a process of elimin- ation, therefore, it would seem that, for Wynne at least, Greater Britain  implied those parts of the empire where there were sufficient numbers  of English settlers to provide a foothold for the English Church.
 A more radical view of English Christianity linked symbiotically to  the worldwide spread of the English race was promoted by the Reverend  Henry William Tucker (1830–1902), prebendary of St Paul’s cathedral,  London, honorary secretary of the CMS and former secretary of the  SPG.  103   His survey history of Anglicanism was entitled  The English  Church in Other Lands  (1886). This covered, in eight chapters, missions  to colonies where there had been significant English settlement: the  United States; Newfoundland  , Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario; the British Empire’, see R. Strong, ‘The Church of England the British Imperial  State: Anglican Metropolitan Sermons of the 1850s’, in  Church and State in Old and  New Worlds  ed. H. M. Carey and J. Gascoigne (Leiden, 2010) (in press).

 northwest Canada; the West Indies  ; South America; Australia  ; New  Zealand   and the Pacific; and South Africa  ; with five more chapters on  foreign missions on the east coast of Africa, the west coast of Africa,  the East Indies and China, Japan and Borneo. The meaning of his sub- title (‘The Spiritual Expansion of England’) is developed in the con- clusion. Here, Tucker links the outward spread of the English-speaking  race and what he accepts as the inevitable triumph worldwide of their  institutions, speech and thought, to the spread of English religion,  which he conceived as not necessarily exclusively that of the Church of  England: ‘In all these lands, whither the Anglo-Saxon race drifts and  settles, Christianity, imported, perhaps with all its differences and divi- sions, from Great Britain, will supply the people with spiritual life.’  104    Although it might be divided at home, diversity and adaptation to colo- nial conditions would be the greatest strength of the coming Catholic  Church of England which, like Constantine, would bring Christian  unity to the empire. He goes on to express a ‘wild day-dream’ that one  day a great English Church, forged in the colonial furnace, might lead a  new Reformation of the churches of the old world, conquering first the  papacy, then Orthodoxy and the distinguished apostolic churches of  the east, which he dismisses as ‘corrupt churches which now cling with  tenacity to their traditions, but show little zeal or other signs of life’.  105    It is notable that Tucker seems to intend to leave Protestant Europe to  its own devices – but otherwise plans a spiritual assault, led by colonial  shock troops, on the greater part of the landmass of Europe and the  Middle East. Imperial ambitions for English religion probably never  reached dizzier heights than this.
 For more secular popularisers of colonisation, British religion – often  expressed in somewhat vague terms it must be admitted – was appreci- ated as a unifying force that could assist in the dissemination of British  social and ethical values. From about the 1860s, these ideas were  affected by the impact of a wealth of new intellectual ideas, including  German higher criticism and the rationalist rejection of what an articu- late minority saw as superstitious elements within Christianity. In place  of the national Church, which many saw as failing to provide moral  and intellectual leadership to the world, progressive imperialists and  broad churchmen within the Church of England advocated the trans- plantation of the national culture and British institutions.  106   At Oxford, 104     H.

Bell, ‘Unity and Difference: John the historian John Robert Seeley   (1834–95) was one of those who saw  the empire as a site for the spiritual advance of unity and righteousness  under the British flag. Seeley was influenced by Coleridge, Arnold and  Maurice and their aspirations for the Church of England to send the  light of civilisation through the world, but he came to see the existing  churches as inadequate to the task of serving the imperial state. While  he continued to argue that religion had a vital role to play, Seeley advo- cated that it be served by a ‘new clerisy’, and updated Coleridge’s ori- ginal ideal to include bureaucrats and secular scholars like himself. He  looked to a Universal Church of the future that would be defined not  by national religion but rather by universal civilisation.  107   These ideas  were also promoted by imperial organisations such as the Empire Day  Movement  , the League of Empire  , and the Round Table  , which aimed  to facilitate the creation of an organic, moral union between Britain and  her colonial offspring.  108   All of these organisations drew their strong- est support from the white self-governing dominions of South Africa  ,  Canada, Australia   and New Zealand  , with leadership in Britain itself  coming from the press, the churches and the universities.
 Like Greater Britain  , the new clerisy imagined by Seeley was the lin- eal heir of an earlier religious ideal; its members were part priests and  scholars, part public intellectuals.  109   Civic religion of the imperial age  incorporated both historical events and secular and religious symbols  into objects of veneration. To Frederick Alexander Kirkpatrick   (1861– 1953), for example, whose  Lectures on British Colonization and Empire   were published under the auspices of the League of the Empire, it was  appropriate to end his survey with a reflection on two national monu- ments which he assumed were able to summarise the glory of the British  nation: Nelson’s flagship,  Victory , anchored in Portsmouth Harbour, and  Westminster Abbey  , ‘the ancient sanctuary which contains the tombs  of many men who have done their part in the history of Great Britain  and of the British empire’.  110   Westminster Abbey was of course a dedi- cated Christian church, but it was increasingly regarded as the central  shrine to the British nation.

 There are several issues that we need to pursue from this point. In  the first place, what meaning did religion have for those settlers who  took their churches from Britain and planted them in the colonies?  There has been fine work done by religious historians and sociologists  in this field.  116   On the whole, they tend to argue that, apart from a few  exceptional cases, emigrants and colonists were no more religious than  the countrymen they left behind – but they were more enterprising and 114     E.

 adaptable. In the new world, it was possible to let go of older allegiances,  to change churches, to marry a partner who was not of the same church,  or to abandon church-going altogether. Nevertheless, while secularisa- tion was an option, most chose instead to adapt and nurture the religious  traditions of their homelands. Church-going for colonists was one of  the ways that they articulated a new identity, one that reminded them of  home, demonstrated where they had come from, and what they aspired  to achieve. We will find repeatedly that settlers were deeply interested  in religious issues and went to extraordinary lengths to transplant their  churches to the new settlements. Social historians have done much to  establish the commercial and secular characteristics of the great British  emigration of the second half of the nineteenth century. However, this  is not the whole story. Emigration and colonisation had a religious  dimension, which is why it was so energetically promoted by church  agencies, including colonial missionary societies. I have suggested in  this chapter that religion also played a significant role in shaping the  idea of Greater Britain  , a settler realm without an established Church,  but with a Christian ethos shaped by the British churches. The next  chapter will consider the religious history of the empire and the context  for the colonial mission of the churches which followed. For those who  went out into the British world in the nineteenth century, there were to  be more religious options than there were for Britons in the Protestant  nation which settled the Atlantic world in an earlier age.
 The history of the planting of Christianity forms an essential part of the  history of European empires.  1   Latourette  , one of the few historians who  has dared to write a complete, scholarly history of Christianity in all its  branches, considered that it was not until 1944 (the year he completed  his magisterial seven-volume survey) that Christianity began to be a  world religion, rather than what he called a ‘colonial or imperial exten- sion, ecclesiastically speaking, of an Occidental faith’.  2   Nevertheless,  the imperial phase of the planting of Christianity in the settler colonies  of the British empire has tended to be forgotten in recent times. There  are nationalist and post-colonial reasons for this. Where British settlers  remained a majority force in the population, including Australia  , British  North America and New Zealand  , the churches responded by gener- ating national histories which emphasised autonomous developments  and indigenous contributions to post-colonial churches; in regions  where the settler population declined or disappeared in sites such as the  British Raj, the plantation economies of the West Indies   or the mobile  occupying force of the British army in India, then the history of the set- tler churches has more or less been forgotten. However, the churches  did not grow spontaneously in the native soil but were transported there  with considerable deliberation and intent. This chapter provides a com- pressed narrative history of British religious settlement throughout the  empire in order to provide a background to the particular studies of  Christian emigration and the colonial missionary societies of Greater 1     The fullest history of European settler Christianity remains that of K.

 Protestant nation, 1801
 This was the religious background to the legal formation of the  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland at the beginning of the  nineteenth century. Prompted by the Irish Rebellion of 1798, the Act of  Union   (1801) united the historic realms of England, Scotland, Ireland  and Wales and Britain’s overseas territories into a single state, ruled by  a Protestant monarch, endowed with two established churches – the  United Church of England and Ireland and the Church of Scotland –  and governed by a single parliament in Westminster.  3   Britain’s empire  had been much reduced by the loss of most of her colonies in the  American War of Independence, but in 1801 it incorporated islands  in the West Indies   such as St Kitts and Nevis (1625), Barbados (1662)  and Jamaica (1655); chilly wilderness regions in North America includ- ing Newfoundland   (1623) and the complex of territories which were  divided into English-speaking Upper Canada   and French-speaking  Lower Canada   (1791); the convict colonies of New South Wales and  Van Diemen’s Land in Australia   (1788); inhospitable regions of eastern  Africa; and military bases such as Gibraltar   (1713).  4   Although it was  occupied by the British in 1795, Cape Colony   did not become a British  colony until 1806.

 Throughout these widely scattered domains there were significant  religious divisions which the government generally regarded as a threat  to national and imperial unity. In an attempt to subdue the voice of dis- sent, establishment Protestantism was therefore protected legally and  endowed financially. Only those who swore allegiance to the Protestant  monarch and publicly confessed to the Thirty-Nine Articles   (the   sixteenth-century formulation of the doctrines of the Church of England)  were eligible to serve the British crown. Most of the  professions – not just  the Anglican and Presbyterian ministry, but the judiciary, the universi- ties, parliament, the colonies and commissioned ranks in the army and  navy – were closed to all but establishment Protestants. Among those  excluded were Nonconformists,  5   such as the old Baptists  , Quakers  ,  Congregationalists   and Unitarians, and the new Wesleyan Methodists  ,  as well as Catholics  , Jews   and adherents of all other religious faiths. Yet,  whatever their religious convictions, everyone was subject to church  taxes that contributed to the support of the two established churches  which were also richly supported from their historical endowments. In  Ireland, this meant that 3,150,000 Catholics and 900,000 Presbyterians  paid tithes in aid of 450,000 adherents of the established Church of  Ireland.  6   Like Irish Catholics, Welsh Nonconformists  , who formed a  majority in much of the principality, were excluded from a say in the  governance of their own country. Laws that required them to pay taxes  to support a national Church to which they did not adhere also distressed  a significant number of Episcopalians   in Scotland and Presbyterians   in  England. Beyond British shores, the same inequitable system applied. In  Upper Canada  , religious endowments were monopolised by an Anglican  and, from 1824, a Presbyterian minority. Religion was less of an issue in  colonies with a majority non-Christian population where the regimes of  the various charter companies kept  missionaries – and other perceived  impediments to trade – firmly at bay.
 Collectively, these constitutional arrangements ensured that state- supported Protestantism was neither an accidental nor a marginal  characteristic of either the United Kingdom or her overseas  colonies.  Indeed, as Linda Colley has argued in an influential thesis, it was vital 5     ‘Nonconformity  ’ refers throughout this book to non-Anglican Protestantism. In the  nineteenth century, it incorporated the Unitarians, Congregationalists (or Puritans),  Baptists and Quakers, who had opposed the Act of Uniformity (1662), and newer  groups such as the Methodists, the Plymouth Brethren and the Salvation Army. The  Act of Toleration (1689) allowed Nonconformists to avoid penalties for non-attendance  at Anglican church services, but it was not until the repeal of the Test and Corporation  Acts (1828) and subsequent reforms that first Nonconformists, then Catholics (1829)  and Jews (1890), achieved full emancipation.
 in bringing together the various heterogeneous ethnic and religious  components of the British nation.  7   Prior to the American Revolution,  Protestantism had helped to define and shape the ‘Atlantic World’  , a  region of English-speaking cultural and economic dominion which  stretched from the British Isles to the Americas, included the Caribbean,  and followed the slave and sugar trades to Africa.  8   In the wake of the  voyages of James Cook  , the British Protestant state, with its enlighten- ment values, missionary enthusiasm and evangelical hopes, was also  extended to the Pacific.  9   By 1851, the American writer Robert Baird  celebrated the Christian advances of the Protestant powers of Holland,  England and the United States in the following terms: ‘Their colonies  are numerous and important. England and Holland have all the great  islands in the Indian and Pacific oceans. England, especially, is extend- ing her influence and her Protestantism immensely, by means of her  vast Colonial Possessions in the Old and New Worlds.’  10
 Other than the English Bible, the one thing British Protestants  tended to have in common was opposition to Catholics   – a not incon- siderable ideological force. As subjects of a Protestant monarch, most  British citizens were ready and eager to defend and extend the faith  of the realm both at home and abroad. Anti-Catholicism formed part  of a nationalist discourse that decried Roman Catholicism as morally  and politically tyrannical and celebrated Protestantism as the font of  British liberty.  11   Nevertheless, the nationalist assertion of Protestant  Britain smoothed over significant divisions between different kinds of  British Protestantism, especially that which separated Nonconformity 7     Colley,  Britons .

 and the two established churches of England and Scotland. Indeed,  ‘Protestant’ should probably be seen as just as much of a flag of con- venience as ‘British’, though none the less meaningful for all that. At  the beginning of the century, when Catholics throughout Great Britain  and Ireland began to press successfully for reform, they therefore faced  strong opposition from all classes of society. Attempts by Westminster  to ameliorate the worst of the disabilities affecting Catholics unleashed  anti-Catholic riots in Edinburgh in 1779 and in London the follow- ing year when a Scottish peer, Lord George Gordon  , incited the mob.  Conservative Protestants never abandoned the aspiration to complete  the Reformation by eradicating Catholicism from Britain entirely. For  their part, Catholics defined England, Scotland and Ireland as mission  fields and looked forward to the time when they would be restored to  the one true Catholic and apostolic faith in communion with Rome.
 The privileges of the established Church were supported by local  colonial as well as imperial legislation. In the West Indies   and in the  Cape Colony  , missionaries and other Nonconformist   clergy were seen  as a nuisance, and laws relating to their licence to preach were closely  policed. In 1802, the Jamaican Assembly passed a law which gave mag- istrates the power to withdraw the licence to preach from anyone con- sidered likely to incite the slave population to acts of rebellion: Baptists    and Methodists   were particularly suspect, and at least one licensed  Methodist missionary was sent to jail for illegal preaching.  12   In New  South Wales, Catholic priests associated with the convict uprising at  Castle Hill   in 1798, not long after the Irish Rebellion  , had their permis- sion to celebrate Catholic services removed. It is necessary to emphasise  the legal nicety of all these arrangements. Public prayer and religious  meetings could be – and occasionally were – regarded as seditious activ- ities that attracted government sanction or proscription. Only mem- bers of the established Church or, after the abolition of the Test Acts,  licensed dissenting ministers were able to pray in public – and even then  only in properly established places of worship. Even where religious  toleration was practised, the assumption of privilege by the Church of  England and the subsidies provided to their clergy continued to be a  major annoyance to colonists of other religious persuasion, or none.
 While popular support for the established Church is difficult to judge  and should not be underestimated,  13   the sectarianism that defined  and divided the British Protestant nation in 1801 helped prop up an 12     P. Wright, ed.,  Knibb ‘the Notorious’: Slaves’ Missionary, 1803–1845  (London, 1973),  p. 25.
 unequal social and political order. The old religion sustained the power  of the old regime, entrenching the advantages of a ruling elite that was  defined narrowly by class, religion, gender and ethnicity. Aristocratic  privilege, which was linked to the power of the established Church, was  curtailed by the constitutional revolution  , which ended what Brown  calls the ‘spiritual monopoly’ of the Church of England.  14   Meanwhile,  it fell as a particular burden on the lower orders, including the clergy of  many churches who were constrained  economically, socially and spir- itually by conditions in Britain. Fortunately, one outlet for these poor,  but rising and often highly ambitious and idealistic men, was provided  by the colonies where there were opportunities to serve as chaplains or  as agents of the missionary societies.
 Chaplains Chaplaincy was the system that evolved historically in the Church of  England to provide religious services in free chapels, independent from  the ordinary jurisdiction of the parish priest.  15   Traditionally, chaplains  were appointed to royal and judicial courts, to wealthy private house- holds or to dependencies of large ecclesiastical institutions. By the nine- teenth century, chaplains had evolved into the mobile frontiersmen of  the clerical profession. They could be found overseas in hardship posts  or coping at home with the new social and political conditions sparked  by the industrial revolution and the explosive growth of cities. From  1825, Church affairs in British colonies were regulated by an act of  parliament.  16   This allowed British consuls to appoint chaplains ‘at any  foreign port or place’, so long as they received a licence from the bishop  of London, and government outlay was met with matching funds raised  by local subscription. Since this was a relatively informal system – and  the bishop of London was generally a long way away – complaints might  arise if rival chaplains wished to serve the same community.  17
 Originally, as servants of the crown, chaplains were always ordained  ministers of the two established churches. However, following the 14      Ibid ., p. 203. See p. 11 above.     15     T.

 abolition of the Test and Corporation Acts   and Catholic emancipation  ,  Nonconformist and Catholic chaplains were given appointments, espe- cially to jails, convict settlements and military settlements. Anglican,  Presbyterian and Catholic chaplains were also employed by the East  India Company   to provide religious comforts to their troops in India  and reform what they regarded as inhumane cultural practices. Charles  Grant  , Chairman of the East India Company, sponsored chaplains  such as the Scottish theologian, Claudius Buchanan   (1766–1815), in  India, later an important advocate of the erection of a colonial Church  establishment.  18
 Another group of clergy who served the British overseas were mili- tary and naval chaplains  .  19   Both the Church of England and the Church  of Scotland had been appointing military chaplains to regiments in  the British Army since the sixteenth century. From 1796, army chap- lains   were coordinated under the Chaplain-General, who enjoyed  a rank equivalent to that of a major general. There was also a long  history of chaplains serving in the Royal Navy.  20   In 1812, the Lords  Commissioner of the Admiralty put the organisation of naval chaplains  on a much more formal basis and appointed a Chaplain-General to the  Fleet. Naval chaplains   received annual pay of £150, had their own ser- vant and a pension, and in some places they took on surrogate duties as  moral guardians and schoolmasters. Purchasing a commission to serve  as a naval or regimental chaplain could be used as an easy way to earn a  living since it was not difficult to pay someone else to take the services  involved, though there were attempts to curb this vice.  21   As serving  officers, army chaplains were expected to remain with their regiments  when serving overseas and this seems to have been the beginning of an  official religious presence, funded by the British government, in terri- tories overseas. Chaplains might also be appointed to any expedition  of an official character with the general idea that they represented the  ‘Defender of the Faith’ and helped to elevate the tone. As Snape   has  shown, soldiers, sailors and their officers were often strongly religious  and the army and navy served to promote British religious institutions 18     For Buchanan, see p. 50 below.     19     W.

 in many remote places.  22   In Newfoundland  , pious naval officers were  among those who agitated for more regular religious services than those  provided by the SPG and initiated subscriptions to repair its dilapi- dated churches.  23   If we look carefully, it is evident that the religious  pluralism and toleration, which came eventually to be seen as charac- teristic of the British empire, was pioneered in the armed services from  where it set the pace for later changes in religious arrangements in all  British colonies.
 chaplain’. The state continued to interfere in the activities of chaplains  in a way which was highly exacerbating, especially to colonial bishops,  but was the logical result of their employment by the state.  27
 But apart from the appointment of chaplains, the British government  really did little to promote religion in the colonies. In his monumental  three-volume history of the Church of England in the colonies, James  S. M. Anderson   argued that there had never been a time in which  England did not show an interest in the spiritual welfare of her foreign  possessions.  28   However, even Anderson admitted that the main way in  which this concern was expressed was through the provision of a thin  stream of colonial chaplains under the auspices of the SPG.  29   What is  more, colonial chaplains had a reputation for being second-raters who  would not have been able to secure ordination in the ordinary way.  This may just be the result of snobbishness, but it also reflected the  conditions of their employment as lowly servants of what were often  unpopular and distant colonial administrations. Writing in the middle  of the nineteenth century, a low view of both the colonial chaplain as  an institution, and the Anglican clergy in particular, is reflected by the  English satirist William Makepeace Thackeray   (1811–63) in the novel,   The Virginians  (serialised 1857–9). Virginia, he states, was an Anglican  colony where the clergy were supported by the state. Without bishops of  their own, they were brought over to America from Britain: Such as came were not, naturally, of the best or most eloquent kind of pastors.  Noblemen’s hangers-on, insolvent parsons who had quarrelled with justice or  the bailiff, brought their stained cassocks into the colony in hopes of finding a  living there.  30
 Thackeray, who was born in Calcutta, may be reflecting here the   common view of the day that a guaranteed income was a factor in  the low moral and intellectual standing of clergy in colonies such as  the West Indies  . But his view of the low standards of the chaplains pro- vided to British colonies was also common among American writers.  According to Frank Samuel Child  , writing in about 1896, the colonial  parson of New England was ‘no better than he should be’,  31   and com- pared unfavourably with the eager Nonconformist Protestant clergy  who dominated the American religious landscape. A  commitment to  raising the training and standing of chaplains appointed to the colonies 27     The imperial grant for police, magistrates and chaplains to Western Australia ended  in 1888.

 was one consequence of the religious revival at the end of the eighteenth  century. Through the activism of William Wilberforce (1759–1833)  and the group of serious-minded Anglican Evangelicals known as the  Clapham Sect, a number of poor men, many of them from Yorkshire,  were supported through their studies at university and were then helped  to colonial appointments.
 At the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was widely recognised  that these arrangements were inadequate to the needs of the settler colo- nies and reform was essential.  36   Nevertheless, bishops and ecclesiastical 32     Johnson to Moore, 8 May 1793, Lambeth Palace Library, Moore Papers.     33     Marsden to Moore, 4 May 1794; Johnson to Moore, 8 May 1793, Lambeth Palace Library, Moore Papers.     34     Johnson Journal, 16 April 1794, fol. 29, Lambeth Palace Library, Moore Papers.

For earlier  studies, see E. Chilman, ‘Bishops in the British Colonies: The Story of the Oversea establishments were slow to appear in the colonies and initially their  appointments arose in response to political crises into which a bishop  was introduced as a pacifying gesture. The first Anglican colonial dio- cese to be erected was Nova Scotia (1787), the second was Quebec  (1793), and, in 1836, the first outside the Americas was created for  bishop Broughton of Australia  .  37   In India, the Scottish theologian and  educator,   Claudius Buchanan (1766–1815) – described by Porter as  an ‘establishment propagandist’  38   – argued that Britain’s geographical  empire should correspond with its spiritual empire. At the invitation of  Josiah Pratt  , the Secretary of the CMS, Buchanan provided a rationale  for the replacement of missionary and chaplaincy arrangements with  an imperial Church establishment.  39   For Buchanan, the argument was  simple: the ‘law of God’ was recognised by the British legislature. Just  as Rome had for many years recognised a duty to extend Christianity  throughout her empire, so, in the present age, that responsibility fell to  Great Britain.  40   However, for this purpose, Buchanan felt the existing  Church instruments, namely, the three missionary societies (the SPG,  SPCK   and CMS), were inadequate. He therefore proposed the cre- ation of what he called a ‘General Colonial Ecclesiastical Establishment  for Great Britain’, which would include at least seven dioceses: the  West Indies  , Bengal or North Hindostan, Madras or South and East  Hindostan, Bombay or West Hindostan, Ceylon, South Africa   and  New South Wales, each with a bishop and clergy on the scale of the  regular English dioceses.  41   While there were many reasons why in 1813  this proposal for the whole empire failed, it had the effect of keeping the  cause of the English church and missions to India before the public eye,  and securing funding from the East India Company for a bishopric and  Anglican ecclesiastical establishments in India  .
 While some Anglicans called for an imperial expansion of the  Church of England, religious reforms to the constitutional standing  of Nonconformists and Catholics were soon reflected throughout the  empire in many different ways. Anglicanism continued to enjoy prior- ity, but, by the 1830s, religious provisions varied widely from colony to  colony.

 there was no automatic transmission of Church establishment to British  colonies.  42   However, in some places, including Barbados   and Upper  Canada  , ecclesiastical establishments were created by special colonial  legislation, as they had been in many (but not all) American colonies. In  such places, the bishop could exert considerable political power. This was   sometimes seen as aggressive imperial intrusion on the part of the Church  of England and the SPG  , especially by other Protestants.  43   In the absence  of a presiding colonial bishop, the appointment of colonial clergy was  carefully regulated by the bishop of London.  44   Before ordination, each  candidate for colonial service was required to show testimonials from  three or more clergymen, a certificate of birth or baptism, a document  showing that their intention to seek ordination had been announced in  their parish for three successive Sundays, a certificate of education as well  as a ‘firm promise’ of an ecclesiastical appointment. The responsibilities  of the bishop of London   for colonial clergy ended with the appointment  of colonial bishops, beginning with Nova Scotia in 1787. However, the  licences of Anglican colonial clergy to practice in Britain continued to be  controlled tightly under the Colonial Clergy Acts  .  45
 Attempts to regulate the colonial churches by imperial legislation had  mixed success but reveal a trend towards increasing religious toleration.  Between 1634 and 1853, there were just eight orders-in-council and  seven acts of parliament that related to the colonial Church.  46   These  included arrangements for giving the bishop of London jurisdiction  over plantations in the West Indies   (1726), suppressing the number of  Roman Catholic festivals in Trinidad (1822), ordaining clergy especially  for the colonies (1819) and disposing of the clergy reserves in Canada  (1827, 1840 and 1853). At a time of critical change in the constitutional  position of the Church of England, W. E. Gladstone   published  The  State in Its Relations to the Church  (1838), which provided a comprehen- sive analysis of religious provisions for the military and the British col- onies.  47   While personally supporting the ideal of a universal, or ‘national 42     See W.

 Church’  , Gladstone   stressed that the Church of England had no auto- matic rights flowing from its establishment in England, even with serv- ing members of the military. He noted that after Catholic emancipation    Roman Catholic soldiers were exempted from attending ‘Church’ ser- vices, but that in Ireland their officers were obliged to attend Catholic  religious services with them ‘in order to prevent their being tampered  with by political harangues’ (a precaution which was subverted since  the sermons were often given in Irish).  48   Nonconformists (referred to by  Gladstone   as Dissenters) were not exempted, but in every military sta- tion divine service was provided by local clergymen of the established  churches of England and Scotland. For Gladstone  , this demonstrated  that full toleration was accorded to Catholics, recognition was given to  the Church of Scotland   in Scotland, and the Church of England was  supported everywhere else.  49
 Indeed, for a brief period in the 1830s, the empire was a place of  multiple establishments  , or at least multiple churches, missions and  chaplaincies supported by the imperial and colonial governments. The  empire, it would seem, was Protestant and Anglican no longer. However,  this new toleration came at a very significant financial cost. In 1839,  James Stephen   (1789–1859), British under-secretary for the colonies,  prepared a return of the cost of colonial Church establishments for the  House of Commons.  50   This revealed that this had risen to an impressive  £168,242 per annum divided between the Church of England, which  received £134,450 (80 per cent), the Church of Scotland £9,967 (5.9  per cent), the Dutch Reformed Church £6,886 (4.1 per cent), mostly in  Cape of Good Hope, and the Roman Catholic Church (8.7 per cent),  especially in Mauritius, Lower Canada, Trinidad, and New South  Wales and Van Diemen’s Land. The Wesleyan minister at the Cape of  Good Hope received £75, and in Jamaica there was £500 for a Wesleyan  chapel, £600 for a Baptist chapel, and £1,000 for a Jewish synagogue  .  While thirty-nine colonies benefited from this bounty, by far the lar- gest sums were expended in maintaining Anglican ecclesiastical estab- lishments in British North America and the West Indies  , where the  bishop of Jamaica and the bishop of Barbados both enjoyed salaries  of £4,000. These were not large episcopal salaries by British stand- ards, and were comparable to those of most bishops in Ireland.  51   Other 48     W. E.

 colonial bishops received much less, particularly if they were depend- ent on the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund  . Nevertheless, these expensive  arrangements were vulnerable to parliamentary economy drives, par- ticularly under Whig reforming governments.  52   Always unpopular with  non-Anglicans, subsidies for ecclesiastical establishments, schools and  clergy in the  colonies disappeared completely by the 1860s.
 At about this time, Gladstone   made repeated efforts to introduce  uniform imperial legislation that would create a more democratic and  independent form of synodal governance for the Church of England  across the empire, but was forced in the end to abandon the attempt.  53    Following the Colenso case   (1860), it was determined by the Privy  Council that the imperial government did not have the power to cre- ate territorial bishoprics in colonies with their own legislatures.  54    After this date, the independent colonies, which had responsibility  for most other aspects of their own affairs, were given sole charge of  what remained of their ecclesiastical establishments. In some cases,  for example in Barbados, the colonial legislature re-established the  Church of England and continued to give grants to other churches.  55    However, most governments embraced secularism and dispensed with  the financial and political burden of supporting religious institutions.  In the ensuing funding vacuum, church planting was taken over by  the colonial missionary societies or, where they could afford it, the  colonial churches.
 Religious arrangements for settlers and travellers in the British empire  can thus be seen to have passed through a number of phases. In the first  place, chaplaincy services were supplied to military bases, hospitals and  penal establishments, and these were extended to colonial settlements  that served the same purposes. In the case of colonies, religious provi- sions varied according to the nature of the colony and whether it was  one intended predominately for British settlement or if missions to the  native population were also required; these were managed through 52     Porter,  Religion Versus Empire? , p. 158. In the 1860s, the archbishop of Armagh earned  £10,000 per annum while the nine less senior bishops earned on average £3,850 per  annum.

 the missionary societies. It was not until the 1840s that new arrange- ments, which asserted the central importance of resident, territorial  bishops throughout the empire supplanted the old  system of chaplains,  societies and subsidies. Anglican colonial bishops were initially sup- ported by government and later through the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund  .  Paradoxically, the arrival of these Anglican bishops occurred more or  less at the same time as the collapse of state support for religious estab- lishments anywhere except in Britain itself, and in some cases, not even  there. At all times, it is important not to exaggerate the extent of state- supported religion in the British empire. Apart from the appointment  of chaplains and ecclesiastical establishments in certain colonies, the  government did little to promote the advancement of religion beyond  Britain’s shores. Even while Britons enthusiastically embraced its tradi- tional identity as a Protestant kingdom, imperial religious provision was  in reality left substantially in the hands of various voluntary societies.
 Missions and societies In contrast with the weak pulse of official religion, the voluntary mission- ary societies   were quick to embrace the religious opportunities opened  up by imperial expansion. Voluntarism was a broad ethos that embraced  not only the older Anglican societies such as the Society for Promoting  Christian Knowledge (SPCK  ), the Society for the Propagation of the  Gospel (SPG  ) and the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian  Knowledge (SSPCK),   but also the new missionary and benevolent   societies.  56   While the larger societies soon extended their interests world- wide, there was an unspoken attempt to avoid too much duplication of  Christian effort. The SPG retained responsibility for British colonists;  the Baptist Missionary Society   (BMS) was first in India, though soon  the London Missionary Society   (LMS), the Church Missionary Society  (CMS) and the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society (WMMS) also  had major missions there; the LMS had the Pacific; the CMS   took on  west Africa and the WMMS   had a foothold in southern Africa. The  importance of the voluntary principle to all these organisations does not  mean they were entirely independent of either the government or the  churches. Most were closely aligned with one or other of the churches 56     The dates of the foundation of the major missionary societies   is as follows: SPCK  ,  1698; SPG, 1701; SSPCK, 1709; Baptist Missionary Society, 1793; London  Missionary Society, 1795; Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East, 1799;  Sunday School Union, 1799; Religious Tract Society, 1799; Abolition of Slave Trade,  1807; British and Foreign Bible Society, 1804; and Wesleyan Methodist Missionary  Society, 1813.
 and, while they did not have an official character, they all accepted land  grants and other government assistance to aid their work. One feature  of the voluntary missionary societies was soon also to be reflected in  the makeup of the colonial clergy, namely, the importance of person- nel drawn, not just from outside the established Church but also from  outside England, including Scottish, German, Danish, Dutch, Irish,  Swiss and other trained missionaries from pietist societies and agen- cies in Europe.  57   For missionary work, the Catholic Church drew in  the same way on its religious orders, which tended to field recruits from  throughout the Catholic world where missionary feeling, and an excess  of clergy to available opportunities for employment, ran high. These  ‘foreign’ personnel helped to dispel the perception that the missionary  societies acted as surrogates for British national interests.
 Voluntary societies were also essential for the provision of religious  literature and education  , which was almost entirely a church-led oper- ation. All the churches used schools as a means of supplying Christian  education, which on some occasions meant students were supplied  with religious indoctrination along with literacy and bible reading.  In the colonies, the SPG supplied funds and trained staff for both  churches and schools. The colonial mission of the SPG is discussed  more fully in  Chapter 3  and the SSPCK, its Scottish counterpart, in   Chapter 7 . The oldest of the religious publication societies was the  SPCK  , which was founded by Thomas Bray   in 1698 and established  with its own act of parliament in 1701. Bray’s initiative was intended  to provide pious reading matter for the poor and encourage the forma- tion of parish libraries. Its publications were also the stock-in-trade of  the itinerant preacher.  58   The objects of the SPCK included not only  the publication and distribution of bibles and religious tracts, but the  erection of charity schools in all parts of England and Wales. The  extension of this work to British colonies was also encompassed by the  final general object which was the promotion of Christian knowledge,  both at home and ‘in other parts of the world’ by the best available  means. This ensured that the publications of the SPCK, conveniently  transportable to new worlds, were distributed rapidly throughout the  British colonies.
 57     A. F. Walls, ‘The Eighteenth-Century Protestant Missionary Awakening in Its  European Context’, in  Christian Missions and the Enlightenment , ed. B. Stanley (Grand  Rapids, MI, 2001), pp. 35–6.
 In the course of the eighteenth century, the SPCK   was joined in its  work of establishing primary schools and publishing and distributing  Christian reading material throughout the empire by societies whose  members were affiliated with other churches and church parties. The  Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge among the Poor (1750) was  non-denominational and was intended to provide ‘bibles, testaments  and other good books’ to those who could read, but could not afford  their own books.  59   Two Scottish societies with the same purpose were  formed in Edinburgh and Glasgow in 1756. However, the impetus for  the establishment of an Anglican Evangelical rival to the SPCK was not  effectively galvanised until after the French Revolution.         The Religious  Tract Society   (1799) provided a vehicle to include the non-churched  within the moral circle of a church increasingly anxious at the extent  of working-class alienation from religion and susceptibility to a var- iety of evils ranging from Jacobism to Romanism. The philanthropist  and writer Hannah More   (1745–1833) was one of those who believed  that the publication of pious tracts distributed to the poor would pro- vide them with religious comforts, direct their attention to the coming  kingdom of Christ, and incidentally dissuade them from revolution. At  the very least she hoped, like her character Coelebs, to show how reli- gion ‘may be brought to mix with the concerns of ordinary life, with- out impairing its activity, lessening its cheerfulness, or diminishing its  usefulness’.  60   On this principle, it was axiomatic that tracts would be  distributed in enormous numbers to emigrants and colonists abroad  as well as to the poor and disenfranchised at home. Other societies,  especially the British and Foreign Bible Society   (1804), the British and  Foreign Schools Society (1807) and the societies which merged in 1851  to form what became the Colonial and Continental Church Society  ,  were organised with the needs of the wider world opened up by the  voyages of exploration of James Cook  , and the advancing colonial set- tlements of the second British empire in Australia  , southern Africa and  the South Seas, specifically in mind.
 The work of all the tract societies overseas was intended to provide  a bridge between the well-resourced religious provision of the home  society and the religious frontier.  61   At home, they supplied books to  form pious libraries in parishes and Sunday schools and places without 59      An Account of the Society for Promoting Religious Knowledge among the Poor Begun 1750   (London, 1879), p. 5.
 By 1849, when the Society commemorated its Jubilee by publishing a  substantial history of its work to that date, its work was already being  conceived in imperial terms, as the duty of the British people to evan- gelise the empire. For the supporters of the Religious Tract Society,  such a role flowed naturally from the pre-eminence of Britain among  the nations of the world and the acquisition of colonies, which could  only be part of a divine plan: Colonies established by other powers are now, by the providence of God,  the dependants of our sea-girt island, and within the reach of our influence.
 These kinds of sentiments, in which there was a fusion of piety, nation- alism and missionary commitment, were characteristic of the colonial  missionary movement which flourished in all the major churches from  the 1850s. In general, we will see that societies such as, in this case, the  SPCK  , which worked with emigrants – including convicts – was one of  the first organisations to use this language in representations of emigra- tion, convict exile and colonial settlement.
 Reform and revival There were a number of religious, political and social factors at work  to bring about change to the religious condition of British people both  at home and overseas. For all the British churches, the nineteenth cen- tury was a time of constitutional reform and religious enthusiasm. This  encompassed the continuing impact of the evangelical revival, which  had begun in the eighteenth century, the Oxford movement   for the  Church of England, and what Emmet Larkin   called the Catholic ‘devo- tional revolution’.  67   Evangelicalism also had a profound influence on 66      Ibid ., p. 640.     67     E. Larkin, ‘The Devotional Revolution in Ireland, 1850–75’,  American Historical Review , 77 (1972), pp. 625–52.
 the Church of Scotland   where it gave rise to the Free Church move- ment  . In Ireland, Evangelicals also prospered in greater numbers in  the former Church of Ireland than they did in the former Church of  England; both churches were of course merged by the Act of Union to  form the United Church of England and Ireland.
 Evangelicalism was an international movement that extended to the  Americas and across Europe. In the American colonies, it was associ- ated with the preaching of George Whitefield  ; in Europe, the Moravian  Brethren   sparked a renewed enthusiasm for foreign missions, and in  Britain, the revival began in Wales   where chapel culture would even- tually supplant Anglicanism for most of the population. In whatever  denominational context they arose, religious revivals ensured that thou- sands of pious men and women who went out into the colonies burned  with the wish to reform the world for Christ under the commodious rule  of the British empire. Some chose to evangelise native people, others to  work among the poor and marginalised in cities, others to bring Jews,  or Roman Catholics in Ireland, Scotland and Europe, to Christ in the  belief that the final days were coming. Many saw the colonies as sites to  reforge their home churches and convert the whole British people to a  more perfect, Christian way of life.
 The evangelical movement led to the creation of a number of new reli- gious bodies, of which the most important for emigrants and settlers was  that founded by John Wesley   (1703–91) and his brother Charles   (1707–88).  Coming into being at much the same time as the rise in emigration,  Methodism was forged and tempered by the experience and opportunities  of British colonialism in America and the other settler colonies. Between  1801 and 1836, the total Methodist   membership rose from only 1.65 per  cent to a modest 4 per cent of the adult population of England,  68   but its  growth in the new world was more vigorous. Before the arrival of the  Methodists, church planting in British North America had been strongly  influenced by the founding churches of the United States especially the  Congregationalists   (or Independents), Presbyterians and Baptists  . The  latter churches played the leading role in the American home mission- ary movement, which planted churches in the south and west where the  population was expanding throughout the nineteenth century.
 With its flexible circuit structure, Methodism proved to be ideally  suited to the conditions on the frontier. Latourette called it ‘an agency  for expanding Christianity’.  69   Wesleyans  , as Koss has argued in the case 68     Cook and Stevenson,  British Historical Facts 1760–1830 , p. 163.     69     Latourette,  A History of the Expansion of Christianity , vol. 4, p. 190.
 of the Reverend Hugh Price Hughes   (1847–1902), the founder of the   Methodist Times , were conservative politically and saw the empire as a  legitimate field for their aspirations to become a world church for the  English-speaking peoples.  70   By the beginning of the next century, both  Methodism and Presbyterianism would come to outstrip Anglicanism as  the leading Protestant churches in British North America  . In contrast,  the balance of the churches in Australia   and New Zealand   was rather  closer to that of the home society with Anglicanism making a strong  showing in all colonies. However, even in the antipodes, Methodism  was, by the end of the nineteenth century, the second largest Protestant  denomination.  71   The evangelical revival also had a strong impact among  a large number of serious Christians who chose to work for moral and  spiritual reform within the Church of England, while forming a distinct  ‘low church’ party within it.  72   Throughout this book, they are called  Evangelicals (with a capital E) and, like the Methodists, they were one  of the big success stories of colonial Christianity.
 The colonies were important sites for religious reform because they  were generally places of economic opportunity where social and cul- tural habits were more malleable than at home. In Britain itself, reform  was initially more difficult to sustain. However, war with France, which  continued until 1815, insurrection in Ireland and the colonies, and  bouts of revolution in Europe, eroded traditional views of the relation- ship between Church and state. Rebellions in Canada   (1837 and 1838)  and the subsequent Durham Report   sped up reforms to the system  of Canadian clergy reserves and placed limits on the privileges of the  Anglican minority.
 71     See  Tables 1.1 – 1.6  for statistics on colonial denominational adherence.     72     R. W. Vaudry,  Anglicans and the Atlantic World: High Churchmen, Evangelicals, and the Quebec Connection  (Toronto, 2003), p. 8, argues that ‘Low Church’ was used as a term  of abuse by high churchmen against Anglican Evangelicals in British North America  and that the two traditions were quite distinct.
 The colonial missionary movement was to the British empire what  the home missionary movement   was for the American West: a rapidly  mobilised workforce deployed along a moving frontier for the plant- ing of clergy, churches, schools and other religious institutions. In the  United States, the ‘home’ missionary movement, which was restricted  to the American continent, was dominated by women for whom it  became an extension of the social gospel. According to one estimate of  the Protestant home missionary movement in America, in the course  of the nineteenth century over US$150 million was spent on planting  churches. The estimate increases to US$360 million if the amounts  spent on Sunday schools, Bible and tract printing, and Christian col- leges are also taken into account.  76
 77     On Irish Catholic nuns and education, see D. Murphy,  A History of Irish Emigrant  and Missionary Education  (Dublin, 2000); C. Clear,  Nuns in Nineteenth Century  Ireland  (Dublin, 1987); R. Fogarty,  Catholic Education in Australia, 1806–1950 , vol. 2, led and organised almost entirely by men in work that was conceived as  much in terms of empire building as the development of religious and  social infrastructure. The outcome was that, by the end of the century,  the number of clergy and churches in relation to the population of the  settler colonies was close to that in Britain. The story of this movement  is told in  Chapters 3  to  7 .
 The empire of morality Evangelicals from across the Protestant churches found that there were  many issues on which they could agree. Together they formed a power- ful lobby group whose reach extended well into the colonies ensuring  that the ‘call to seriousness’, as it has been called by Ian Bradley  ,  78   had  both an imperial as well as a domestic character. Of the many moral  campaigns fought by the informal coalition of Anglican Evangelicals,  Presbyterians and Nonconformists, the earliest and most successful  was the movement to end the Atlantic slave trade   and eliminate slav- ery throughout the empire. Since this was essentially an evil that had  been created within Britain’s settler colonies in the Americas, it can  be seen as the first salvo in a campaign to moralise and cleanse the  empire. In the late eighteenth century, agitation against the slave trade  was initiated by Quakers who were instrumental in the founding of the  Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade (1787). In the same year,  the impeachment of Warren Hastings   (1732–1818), the first Governor- General of Bengal, brought to light what many felt were moral lapses in  British rule in India, particularly the policy of leaving the work of col- onisation entirely in the hands of commercial enterprises, such as the  British East India Company. In his speeches against Hastings, Edmund  Burke   (1729–97) excoriated those ‘who consider laws, religion, mor- ality, and the principles of state policy of empires as mere questions of  profit and loss’.  79   Although Hastings was acquitted in 1795, after the  trial more consideration was given to the humane and religious admin- istration of colonies. This need not imply that the later ‘moral’ British  empire was any less destructive in its impact on native people than its  earlier, more purely commercial, manifestation. Indeed, it may well  have become more so, since missionaries generally assumed the right Catholic Education under the Religious Orders , 2 vols. (Melbourne, 1959). For Protestant  Home Missionaries in Australia, see A. P. O’Brien,  God’s Willing Workers: Women and  Religion in Australia  (Sydney, 2005) pp. 97–119.
 Evangelicals also led the way in insisting that the commercial opera- tions of Charter companies such as the East India Company  , or the  Hudson’s Bay Company   in Upper Canada  , should acquire a moral  character. The commercial nature of rule in India had not precluded  all religious services, especially to other Europeans. Under its revised  Charter (1698), the East India Company and other trading compan- ies who conducted commercial enterprises in east Asia, Australia   and  America were required to appoint Anglican and Presbyterian chap- lains whose teaching would reflect the orthodoxy of the established  churches at home. Toleration of the religious representatives of other  European colonial powers, such as the Catholic missionaries   of for- merly Portuguese Bombay, was also required as a consequence of the  1689 Toleration Act.  80     Nevertheless, the Charter gave the East India  Company power to exclude disturbing influences, including missionar- ies, from territory under their control.  81   With the effective implementa- tion of direct government rule of India by the India Office, the number  of British administrators and their families resident in India expanded  considerably. The passage of the Charter Renewing Act of 1813 marked  the formal end to the policy that placed heavy restrictions on the activ- ities of Christian missionaries. After 1814, the East India Company  provided Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist and Catholic chaplains to  those serving in its military garrisons.    82
 The high water mark for the political influence of evangelicals was  probably reached sometime before 1830 and declined thereafter. In  contrast with their earlier triumphs in routing moral lapses in the  West Indies   (slavery  ) and India   (Warren Hastings), humanitarians  were unable to persuade the Colonial Office to support the findings  of the 1835–6 Parliamentary Select Committee on Aborigines  , which  brought down a report which condemned settler brutality in Canada,  southern Africa, Australia   and New Zealand  . Instead, the government  moved to permit colonisation of New Zealand  . Missionary influence  over the New Zealand Treaty of Waitangi (1840) was supposed to lead  to the moral management of the acquisition of land, but enraged the 80     P.

 Colonial churches The planting of churches, rather than colonial chaplaincies and mis- sions, began in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. At first,  the most vigorous colonial churches tended to be those of people who  had benefited from earlier political and religious reforms, includ- ing Catholics, Nonconformists, and evangelicals in both the Church  of England and the Church of Scotland. While they were still subject  to condescension by the established Church, there was considerable  optimism that the free churches would liberate patterns of belief and  worship, just as reform was liberating the legislature and widening the  franchise.  86   In speaking in favour of the emancipation of Catholics,  Thomas Chalmers  , who would later become the leader of the Free  Church of Scotland  , argued that free religion would lead inevitably to  the triumph of reformed Protestantism: [G]ive the Catholics of Ireland their emancipation … and give me the circu- lation of the bible, and with this mighty engine I will overthrow the tyranny  of Antichrist, and establish the fair and original form of Christianity on its  ruins.  87
 Colonies and missions were seen as ideal workshops for this great spir- itual experiment.
 Surprisingly, the orthodox mainstream of the Church of England  takes longer to move out to the colonies than Nonconformists or  Evangelical Anglicans. In part, this was because the two oldest Anglican  missionary organisations, the SPG and the SPCK  , received some gov- ernment funding for this purpose. In the 1830s, the reforming mood is  reflected in a new, more vigorous spirit within the SPG under the lead- ership of Ernest Hawkins   (1802–68), which is discussed in  Chapter 3 .  At about the same time – and largely because of increased pressure on  the existing mechanism of support for colonial churches provided by  the diocese of London – Bishop Blomfield began agitating successfully  for the creation of more colonial bishops. In relatively quick succession,  moderate Anglicans consolidated their forces to launch the Colonial  Bishoprics’ Fund   (1841), the colonial missionary college of St Augustine  at Canterbury   (1848), the Emigrants’ Spiritual Aid Fund   (1849) and  the Anglican group settlement scheme for Canterbury   in New Zealand    (1850). These were promoted as works of the whole Church.
 Anglican expansion was complicated by the divisions between dif- ferent church parties   which were redefined as a result of Tractarian    controversies in the 1840s.  88   In places where high churchmen secured  colonial dioceses, moderate Anglicans rallied behind the projects they  created such as the Melanesian Mission  , founded by bishop Selwyn   of  New Zealand  .  89   Evangelicals continued to support the CMS; Anglo- Catholics   preferred to channel funds towards their own missions such  as the Universities’ Mission to Central Africa  , the Cambridge Mission  to Delhi   and the Oxford Mission to Calcutta  , where missionaries  would be free to establish what they saw as a more perfect form of the  English church with full Catholic teaching and ritual, free from state  intrusion.  90
 The creation of colonial bishoprics   led in some instances to tense  standoffs between different church parties in a number of Anglican  dioceses. A comprehensive and unpopular attempt to install Anglican  Christianity as part of the imperial occupation of India   came with the  consecration of Thomas Fanshaw Middleton   (1769–1822) as bishop of 88     P.

 Calcutta. His diocese embraced Ceylon, Malaya and New South Wales  and attempted to impose a much stronger and more exclusive control  over both missionaries and settlers in British India. This more imperial  vision of Anglicanism was not successful and aroused the same kinds  of resistance that had been common in the former American colonies.  As the number of missionaries in India expanded dramatically in the  second half of the nineteenth century, missionaries from other soci- eties soon outnumbered those from the British societies.  91   High church  ambitions to create an Anglican ascendancy in Australia  , New Zealand    and South Africa   were also rebuffed.
 The expansion of   Catholicism in the British empire happened in two  ways.  92   In the first place, Britain secured new territories through con- quest and economic expansion in the nineteenth century, which for  the first time included significant Catholic populations. The largest of  these was in the former colony of New France or Quebec   with its major- ity French population whose religious rights were protected under the  Treaty of Paris (1763), the Quebec Act (1774) and the Constitutional  Act of 1791, which created the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada.  After the war of 1812, during which the Catholic bishop of Quebec sup- ported the British against the United States, the loyal status of French  Catholics was no longer questioned and other Catholic disabilities were  lifted.  93   By removing the privileges of the Church of England   in Canada,  the Act of Union   (1840) effectively disestablished the Anglican Church  and secured further gains for Catholics and other religious denomina- tions in the new colony. More Catholics came under British rule with  the absorption of Newfoundland  , with a population that included large  numbers of French and Irish Catholics, and even more with the capitu- lation of Mauritius  , the former French colony of Île de France, on 3  December 1810. In India and Malaya, the British also encountered  ecclesiastical arrangements inherited from former Catholic powers that  included French, Portuguese and Italian bishops and missionaries as  well as native Catholics whose faith had been planted centuries earlier.  94    Indeed, the Thomas Catholics in India   claimed spiritual descent from  the apostle Thomas in the earliest missionary days of the Church. In  such cases, the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith 91     Frykenberg,  Christianity in India , p. 265.     92     W. T.

 (Propaganda), the papal bureaucracy in charge of foreign missions,  appointed vicars apostolic who were generally English Benedictines, or  Irish or English Jesuits  , who would be acceptable to the English govern- ment. The process of creating new missionary dioceses accelerated dur- ing the pontificates of Pius VII   (1800–23) and Gregory XVI   (1831–46),  who had been prefect of Propaganda before his election. During the  reigns of these two popes, twenty-nine vicariates and dioceses were  established in British colonies in Australia  , Canada, Oceania, Southern  Africa, India, the West Indies   and Madagascar.  95
 In the second place, there were Catholic emigrants from Britain to  the colonies, which, even before Catholic emancipation   in 1829, were  provided with their own chaplains and bishops. Initially, poverty and  cultural inhibitions ensured that Catholics made up a relatively small  proportion of Britons overseas. However, from about 1850, the after- math of famine in Ireland unleashed a flood of refugees and economic  migrants who fled to England, Scotland, America and the British col- onies. Between 1800 and 1880, the Catholic population in the United  Kingdom rose from 90,000 to 1,300,000 in England and from 30,000  to 320,000 in Scotland, most of whom were concentrated in industrial  cities such as Glasgow, Manchester and Liverpool. Millions more emi- grated to the United States, British North America, Australia   and New  Zealand  . These new Catholic populations were predominately Irish  and they gave their allegiance and affection to Irish clergy and bishops.  With the ascendancy of Paul Cullen   (1803–78) as archbishop of Dublin,  Propaganda increasingly bypassed both London and the English-born  Catholics who had gone out to bishoprics in the colony of New South  Wales and elsewhere and gave the nod to Hiberno-Romans selected by  Cullen. As we will see in  Chapter 4 , below the bishops there was a cler- ical proletariat of parish priests and religious sisters and brothers, many  of them belonging to religious orders in Ireland, who were sent in their  thousands to Catholic dioceses throughout the empire.
 Presbyterians   also found opportunities in the empire, although, like  mainstream Anglicans, they were not so quick to extend Reformed  Protestantism overseas as those in other churches. In Scotland,  the Episcopal Church had been disestablished since 1690 and the  Presbyterian Church of Scotland given full benefit of establishment  under the Act of Union (1707). Tensions continued between ortho- dox and evangelical Presbyterians  , Episcopalians   and Presbyterians,  and between Protestants and minority Catholics in the Highlands and 95     For a chronological list of the growth of the Catholic hierarchy in Britain and her col- onies, see Table 4.2.
 Islands. These long-running divisions may have contributed to the  slow growth of interest by the Church of Scotland   in the work of mis- sions and colonial church extension. The Highland Clearances  , which  began in the 1760s, were responsible for the first significant departures  to the colonies, with small groups heading for Nova Scotia   and the  Maritime Provinces  , often accompanied by their own Gaelic  -speaking  Presbyterian and Catholic clergy. After the Peace of 1802 (which was  supposed to secure peace between Britain and France), Scottish soldiers  also turned settler in Upper Canada   (Ontario). Alexander MacDonnell  ,  who had led the Glengarry Fencibles   to the region, went on to become  its first Roman Catholic bishop (1826).  96   The Glasgow Colonial Society  ,  discussed in  Chapter 7 , later incorporated into the Colonial Scheme of  the Free Church of Scotland  , supported Presbyterian Church exten- sion in British North America. In New South Wales, the Presbyterian  minister and emigration advocate, John Dunmore Lang   (1799–1878),  encouraged Scottish settlers to emigrate to Australia  . Irish Presbyterians  were critical to the expansion of the colonial church in British North  America.
 The imperial and global network of Presbyterianism   was articulated  not only through Scottish and Irish emigration throughout the British  empire, but also through Presbyterian connections with other European  reformed Protestants and their colonial empires and missionary move- ments. Hence, in southern Africa, Presbyterians forged bonds with the  Calvinist   adherents of the Dutch Reformed Church   (NGK). Scottish  and Irish Presbyterians were active in the non-denominational foreign  and colonial missionary societies supported by the Congregationalists –  the London Missionary Society   and the Colonial Missionary Society.  Finally, the Disruption of the Church   of Scotland   (1843) fired a much  greater enthusiasm for all branches of mission, including foreign and  colonial missions and missions to Jews, which were conducted by both  the free and established Church of Scotland. British North America,  Victoria in Australia   and New Zealand   attracted a particularly high  proportion of Scottish settlers, many of them with Free Church   affili- ations. The most concrete example of Presbyterian aspirations in the  colonies was the Free Church of Scotland’s support for the colonisa- tion of the province of Otago on the South Island of New Zealand,  discussed in  Chapter 11 .

 course of the nineteenth century. Almost every church – and every  sect and church party within each church – attempted to negotiate a  response to the British colonial empire in some way.  97   At the end of the  nineteenth century, for example, the emergence of the Faith Mission  movement,   including the Scottish Faith Mission   of John George  Govan   (1861–1927), was quickly extended to Canada and South  Africa  ; Hudson Taylor’s China Inland Mission, founded in 1865, was  the model in Australia   for the Aborigines Inland Mission   founded by  Retta Jane Long   in 1905. Through groups such as Christian Missions  in Many Lands  , the Plymouth Brethren   evangelised along the routes  opened up by the British railway in Argentina. Pentecostalism  , which  began in 1906, spread like wildfire along imperial pathways. Because of  the prestige attached to direct evangelism with non-Europeans, many  societies chose to downplay the church planting and colonial institu- tion building that underpinned foreign missionary efforts. Indeed,  both the Faith Missions and Pentecostals tended to denounce earlier  missionary efforts for their institutional encumbrances. They were too  much concerned with God’s Greater Britain  , a political as well as a reli- gious ideal, and not enough with the spiritual realm of God’s empire.  Nevertheless, in writing the history of the colonial missionary move- ment, a line must be drawn somewhere, and these themes will need to  be pursued in other studies.
 For the founding churches of the British empire, the nineteenth cen- tury ushered in a remarkable series of ecclesiastical changes both at  home and in the colonies. The institutional and financial privileges of  the Church of England and Ireland, which had been the base for most  colonial missionary efforts in an earlier era, were dismantled in the col- onies, as they would be later in Ireland (1871) and Wales (1920). This  was only the precursor to the constitutional revolution which removed  disabilities restraining Nonconformists and Catholics at home. While  this was denounced by some religious conservatives, it led not to the  collapse of religion but to a wave of reforming, colonising and mission- ary efforts in the empire at large. For reformed Protestants, missionary  expansion was about the establishment of Christ’s kingdom throughout  the world. Initially, missionaries were successful in their proposal that 97     For the examples which follow, see the notes in G. H. Anderson,  Biographical  Dictionary of Christian Missions  (Grand Rapids, MI, 1999). For an authoritative survey  of the British foreign missionary movement, see Cox,  British Missionary Enterprise .
 This was a popular movement. However, Dilke spoke for colonists and  settlers when he included the settler churches within the British cultural  commonwealth that he promoted under the name of ‘Greater Britain  ’. In  the countries he traversed – British North America, Australia   and New  Zealand  , southern Africa and other sites of significant white emigration  and occupation throughout the empire such as the West Indies  , India and  South America – the colonising churches were moulded by the particu- lar political and cultural settings of the settler states. This encompassed  relationships with rival imperial powers and their churches: French  Catholics and Protestant churches from the United States in the case  of Canada, the Dutch Reformed Church   in southern Africa, whereas  the various British churches were virtually unencumbered by Christian  rivals in their occupation of Australia and New Zealand apart from a  small group of French Catholics  . It also included encounters with native  peoples, slaves and indentured labourers, who were imported to provide  labour in the settler economies. In a wide range of debates – about slav- ery, convict transportation and the impact of colonisation on aborigines    or tribal peoples in southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand and British  North America – the settler churches were at the forefront of discussions  about the morality of the empire. As the frontier passed westward and  northward in both Australia and Canada, these moral anxieties receded.  They would never really go away in both New Zealand and southern  Africa. War in south Africa would demonstrate how fragile the consen- sus endorsing British cultural hegemony was, even in colonies of major- ity white settlement.
 Over the course of a hundred years, what is perhaps the most dis- tinctive change to the religious character of the empire was the loss of  the dominant position enjoyed by the Church of England. This was  accompanied by the disarticulation of the nexus between church and  state that had given the first British empire – that which encompassed  the Atlantic world – its Protestant identity. In the second English- speaking British empire, that of Greater Britain  , the empire retained its  Christian aspirations in informal ways. However, this was a voluntary  movement made up of ‘free’ churches, which competed for resources  from the state, rather than claiming them as a right.
 The British empire was not planned as a Christian commonwealth.  However, in the way of empires, the network of communication, affection and interest that bound peripheries to the metropole ensured  that the drama of religious events in London, Dublin and Edinburgh  was played out in the colonies. Despite their differing theological, eth- nic and social origins, what the churches of Great Britain and Ireland  had in common was the wish to extend their range and influence over  the settler population and make the British a better, more Christian,  people. In the next part of the book, we will look at the idea of ‘colonial  mission’ and at the separate histories of the colonial missions of the  major British churches, whose aim was to make God’s empire contigu- ous with the British empire.
 Before we go there, I should, perhaps, emphasise once again that  this is not a history of religion in the British empire, nor even of all  branches of Christianity in the British world, however defined. It  merely concerns those Christian churches with the resources to cre- ate organisations which planted Christian seedlings in the majority  settler colonies. Of course, this constitutes a good deal less than the  total religious landscape of the empire. However, as Tables 1.1 to 1.6  demonstrate, by 1901 it includes religious adherents, as enumerated  in the census, who made up over 95 per cent of the settler populations  of Canada, Australia, Cape Colony and New Zealand, with smaller  aggregations elsewhere. Together they formed an overseas British  Christian world of around 10 million people. As we will see, this is  more than enough for one book.
 Part II In the course of the nineteenth century, the success of the foreign   missionary movement led to a gradual shift in the meaning of the word  ‘mission’, so that it came to refer exclusively to the evangelisation of   non-European Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews and other non-  Christian people. As a consequence, missions by British Christians to  other British Christians appeared to be a contradiction in terms, even if  it was sometimes argued that many so-called Christians were ‘practic- ally heathen’ and in dire need of missionary aid. However, the earliest  understanding of mission was simply the task of sending someone under  properly delegated authority, to set up a branch of the Church in a new  geographical area. A missionary (from the Latin  missio , ‘I send’) was a  messenger or diplomat. While a mission may have involved conversion if  non-Christians were resident in the area, this was really incidental to the  work he had been sent to perform. When Pope Gregory the Great   sent  Augustine as a missionary to the English in 597, his main responsibil- ity was not to convert the Anglo-Saxons but rather to set up an English  church, consecrate bishops (Bede says he was given orders for twenty- four: twelve bishops for London and twelve bishops for York) and cre- ate an administrative infrastructure so that the papacy had someone  in charge whom they could deal with. In other words, mission was as  much a bureaucratic as a spiritual charge. Having sent out a missionary,  Christian conversion might then proceed, led by a bishop who would  oversee the creation of the new church, which was bound administra- tively to the ruler who had sponsored it, and the religious authority, usu- ally the pope, who had sent the missionary in the first place.
 The religious revival of the eighteenth and nineteenth centur- ies changed the emphasis in British missions so that priority came to  be given to the direct work of preaching the gospel to non-Christian  people outside Europe. As we saw in  Chapter 2 , this work was led not  by the institutional churches but by voluntary missionary societies,  partly because of restrictions that had originally restricted the access of  missionaries to British colonies.
 Henry Venn   (1796–1873), Secretary of the Church Missionary  Society from 1841 to 1873, was chiefly responsible for advancing the  ethos of foreign missions at the expense of the planting of churches in  settler colonies, which in his view was tainted by its association with the  state. On their point of departure for the field, Venn issued instructions  to all CMS missionaries that defined their task in terms of the evangel- isation of new recruits for the Church of England: The one object of the Church Missionary Society is to provide for the preaching  of the Gospel of Christ to those who have not yet received it; and to train up the  Christian converts in the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England.  1
 This gave special emphasis to the conversion of the ‘heathen’, a work  of such importance that all other missionary callings (including the  colonial mission of the CMS’s ‘Church’ rival, the SPG) should be  made subordinate to it. For Venn, the final objective of missionar- ies was to create self-supporting, indigenous churches that would  effectively make the original mission redundant.  2   He regarded all  other work as a waste of resources, declaring in 1852 that the ‘proper  work of a Missionary Society is the evangelisation of the heathen,  and not the perfecting of the Ecclesiastical framework of a Christian  community’.  3   He was therefore not a supporter of the creation of  bishoprics and ecclesiastical establishments which he considered a  distraction from the work of building an indigenous church in col- onies such as India.  4
 As the missionary movement in Great Britain and Ireland expanded  and became more complex, it came to incorporate a host of activities,  which ranged from the original tasks of church planting, conversion of  the heathen and support for colonists, to include almost any work of  Christian service, social welfare or evangelism. The two established  churches had the most ambitious missionary programmes, as we can  see from the activities outlined in sources such as the  Year Book of  the Church of England , first published in 1882.  5   Besides reports from 1     W.

 the colonial bishops (with frequent requests for men and money) the   Year Book  gave accounts of societies that catered for emigrants, colo- nists, seamen and soldiers, as well as missionary colleges that trained  clergy for churches and missions overseas. The Church of Scotland    also aimed to be comprehensive. Its ‘schemes’ included missions to  the heathen, Jews, education, home and colonial missions, all of which  provided detailed reports to the General Assembly. With so much  going on, it was important to stress what distinguished colonial mis- sions from other strands of missionary work. A report of the Colonial  Scheme to the Church of Scotland’s General Assembly in 1860 put this  simply: ‘The object of the Colonial Mission is to assist in providing a  gospel ministry for the Presbyterian population scattered abroad in the  different colonies of Great Britain.’  6   Other churches were also busy on  many fronts. Colonial missions were just one part of a vast spiritual,  social, educational and publication operation that provided services of  one kind or another to virtually the entire British home and overseas  population.
 As colonial, foreign and other missions parted company, they  acquired their own separate committees, organisations and jour- nals. Sometimes it was necessary to explain that these varied activi- ties were related phenomena. In an article for the  British Missionary   ,  the organ of the Congregational Colonial Missionary Society, S.  W. Edwards stated: ‘Colonial and Foreign Missions are two essen- tially related branches of one great enterprise.’  7   While most churches  retained the old sense of mission as church extension under properly  delegated authority, others saw missions as part of the core responsi- bilities of all Christians following Christ’s injunction: ‘As my Father  hath sent me, so send I you’ (John 20: 21). In other words, it was  Christ, not the Church and certainly not the state, who sent the mis- sionary. While this was the scriptural ideal, the practical need for  missionaries to operate within the legal and financial constraints of  colonial regimes ensured that missionaries were always supervised  by missionary societies and they required support, especially in  the form of land grants, from  governments. Like colonial missions,  in other words, they were dependent in many ways on the British  government.
 Emigration   was the spur that led to the creation of many new colo- nial missionary societies, of which the Society for the Propagation 6      Home and Foreign Record of the Free Church of Scotland , 15 June 1860, p. 272.     7     S.

 of the Gospel    , founded in 1701, had been the earliest. By the 1840s, as  Table 3.1 indicates, all the major churches – and some of the smaller  ones – had created societies which had responsibility for raising  funds, sending out trained clergy, catechists or school teachers, and Table 3.1     Colonial missionary societies and auxiliaries Denomination  and party Society and date of foundation Date commenced  colonial work Baptist Baptist Missionary Society (1792); in  1843, incorporated the Baptist  Colonial Missionary Society in Upper  Canada (1836) Catholic Oeuvre de la Propagation de la Foi  (Association for the Propagation of  the Faith) (1822) Church of England  (Evangelical) South American Missionary Society  (1854) Church of England Society for the Propagation of the  Gospel (1701) Church of England  (Evangelical) Newfoundland Church and School  Society (1823) Colonial Church Society (1835)   Amalgamated to form the Colonial Church and School Society  (1851); renamed the Colonial and  Continental Church Society (1861) Congregationalist Colonial Missionary Society 1838 Methodist (Bible Christian) Bible Christian Foreign Missionary Society 1821

 encouraging the creation of independent colonial churches in their own  image. Catholic missionary auxiliaries, notably the French Association  for the Propagation of the Faith (APF), which is discussed in  Chapter 4 ,  raised funds to support similar work.
 Venn’s strategic dismissal of colonial missions continues to inf lu- ence historical accounts of colonial missions. In the extensive entry  on missions in the eleventh edition of the  Encyclopaedia Britannica ,  Eugene Stock  , the historian of the CMS, devoted no more than a  single sentence to colonial missions in which he noted that mis- sions to the British colonial population had been the priority of the  Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and to a lesser extent  the Colonial Church [and School] Society (Church of England),  and the Colonial Missionary Society (Congregational). However, he  was not prepared to recognise that these societies did real mission- ary work: ‘Those missions, however, are more properly an outlying  branch of home missions, being to the professing Christian settlers  or their descendants.’  8   These attitudes were entrenched in mis- sionary discourse by the time of the Edinburgh World Missionary  Conference   (1910), from which colonial missions were excluded. In  more recent times, the same attitude would seem to have informed  the decision to exclude information relating to colonial missions from  Mundus, the large, well-constructed internet gateway to British mis- sionary collections.  9
 How significant were colonial missions in relation to missionary  work as a whole? This question is difficult to answer because, unlike  foreign missionary societies, colonial missionary societies have gen- erally not had the benefit of recent scholarly histories making their  statistics readily accessible to modern researchers.  10   Nevertheless, we  can get some idea of the scale and significance of colonial missions  from a number of different sources. In the first place, we can try to  calculate the scale of funds supplied to support colonial as opposed  to all other kinds of missionary work as this was reported in the   Missionary Register .   The  Missionary Register , founded in 1813 by the  Secretary of the CMS, Josiah Pratt  , provided a digest of missionary 8      E. Stock, H. T. Andrews and A. J. Grieve, ‘Missions’, in  The Encyclopaedia Britannica   (Cambridge, 1910–11), p. 589.

 work around the world, including brief notices about all Protestant  missionary agencies with accounts of their Anniversary Sermons and  meetings and resolutions.  11   The  Missionary Register  therefore also  allows us to compare the earnings of the different streams of the mis- sionary movement. In 1853–4, the annual income from all societies  whose summary notices were included in the  Missionary Register  was  £1,502,695. This was divided between societies classified as Anti- Slavery  , Bible, Education, Jews  , Missionary, Seamen, Tract and Book,  Home, Colonial and other purposes.  12   Unsurprisingly, the largest  incomes were earned by the societies with the largest church member- ship, namely, the CMS (£124,290), the WMMS (£111,048), the SPG  (£104,521) and the LMS (£59,665). Of the Tract and Publication  societies, the SPCK   led the way (£85,436),  13   followed by the non- denominational Religious Tract Society (£74,144). We have already  seen that the Tract and Bible societies were busy in the colonies and  so these earnings are relevant to colonial missions.  14   As a group, the  earnings of the specialist colonial missionary societies   fell somewhere  below the publication societies, with the Home and Colonial School  Society (£6,939), Church of Scotland Colonial Mission (£3,420) and  the Free Church of Scotland Colonial Mission (£5,884), all falling  well below the £10,000 mark.  15
 If we were to sum up the overall financial picture, it would seem that  colonial missions ranked at the lower end of missionary work in terms  of both funding and prestige as these things were measured in the mid- dle of the nineteenth century. Colonial missions lacked the appeal of  the largest foreign mission societies, or the better known educational  and home mission societies, but they nevertheless managed to do rather  better than the specialised missions to Jews or Irish Roman Catholics    or for ragged schools  . Colonists, it would seem, were about on a par 11      The Missionary Register for the Year 1813(–55) Containing an Abstract of the Proceedings  of the Principal Missionary and Bible Societies Throughout the World , 43 vols.

 13     The SPCK   was responsible for administering a fund for emigrants  , providing books  and tracts for clergymen at Plymouth, Southampton and Liverpool, who visited emi- grant ships (p. 494). In this year, 210,000 people sailed from the Mersey to the United  States (194,922), the Australian colonies (20,000), British North America (about  20,000) and the rest to the East and West Indies  . The SPCK also provided scholar- ships to St Augustine’s College, Canterbury  , and presented candidates for holy orders  in the colonies with books for their use (p. 499).
 with British and foreign sailors, or the military (which also had their  own missionary societies) in terms of their capacity to attract the ben- eficence of the British public to their cause.
 Secondly, we can try to measure the circulation and ethos of colonial  missionary periodicals, which – like those of all missionary societies –  were produced in large numbers. The Missionary Periodicals   Database  hosted by the Yale University Divinity School Library attempts to pro- vide an exhaustive coverage of the periodical literature generated by the  foreign missionary movement. However, it does include colonial mis- sionary periodicals in regional listings.  16   In relation to Australia   and the  Pacific, for example, there are 171 missionary periodicals listed from a  total of 580, or just under 30 per cent of all those in the database. While  some of these are concerned only with missions to Aborigines or to  Pacific islanders, many also include accounts of colonial missions.
 In his survey history of the British missionary movement, Cox   argues  that a central function of missionary periodicals was the defamation of  the ‘other’ – the construction of the ignorant, black, benighted heathen  whom the British missionary was sent to convert and uplift. He sug- gests that this propaganda function was much more important to the  missionary societies than making money from what was, in effect, a vast  publicity machine.  17   However, in colonial missionary writing, the defi- nition of the ‘other’ turns out to be less significant than defining ‘us’,  namely, the British and Irish people who supported colonial missionary  societies. As we have already seen in relation to the publications of the  Religious Tract Society, colonial missionary propaganda constructed  a racialised narrative which emphasised the whiteness, homogeneity  and community of colonists with their fellow British or ‘Anglo-Saxon’  compatriots at home. Catholic missions followed a similar rhetorical  strategy by appealing sentimentally to the needs of poor Irish settlers  exiled from home. Otherwise, the rationale provided to the public for  supporting colonial missions was similar for all the churches.
 So what attracted church-going people across the United Kingdom to  give their financial and emotional support to colonial missions? In gen- eral, based on missionary publications, it would seem that support for  colonial missions flowed to some degree from the same sources which  generated enthusiasm for the British empire. These can be summarised  under five headings. In the first place, there is what Niall Ferguson   has 16     Missionary Periodicals Database,  http://research.yale.edu:8084/missionperiodicals/ index.jsp . This site includes valuable annotations prepared by David Seton and  Martha Smalley.
 called ‘Anglobalization  ’, namely, the combined effect of British eco- nomic power over commerce and labour and the cultural hegemony  of the English language and institutions, but with a special religious  twist.  18   The churches argued that, by building churches and extending  their ministry to the colonies, they were helping to spread the benefits  of British civilisation and make the world a better, freer and more moral  place. British imperial patriotism was the common coin of the publi- city and fund-raising propaganda generated by the colonial missionary  societies as we will see in the case studies in the five chapters which  follow.
 A second factor projected by the colonial missionary movement was  more specific to the churches, namely, sectarian   rivalry. Protestantism,  as the constitutional and national face of the British nation, was inte- gral to the colonisation of America and the extension of British rule in  areas of English-speaking settlement in the first imperial age, which  continued until the American revolutionary war.  19   In the second British  empire, religion does not wither away as a colonising force. However,  the established churches in Britain were challenged by legal reform at  home and the excitement of emigration and colonisation abroad. This  had the effect of placing the various British churches on a much more  equal pegging when it came to competing for the adherence of colo- nists. There was a sectarian element to the ensuing struggle. Although  the old language of Protestant freedoms and Catholic enslavement to  Rome appears with great regularity, particularly in the promotional  literature of the Church of Scotland   and Evangelical Anglicans who  remained close to their Reformist roots, it lacked the coercive force of  earlier times. While the British nation was proudly Protestant, the colo- nial empire of the later nineteenth century was multi-denominational,  and the colonial missionary societies helped to make it so.
 Thirdly, the churches were able to play an important role in perpetu- ating the ethnicities   that had once distinguished the separate national  institutions of England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland, and which had  been diluted in the constitutional merger of the Acts of Union. In  the colonies, the Church of England, the Church of Scotland, Irish  Catholicism and Welsh Nonconformity were given a vast new stage  on which to perform older national narratives and were determined to  make the most of it. The Church of England aspired to be the national  Church for the whole empire. Catholics promoted their settler missions  as a spiritual triumph for the Irish people. Since the Irish Catholic 18     N. Ferguson,  Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World  (London, 2004), p. xxiv.     19     Pestana,  Protestant Empire , p. 6.
 Church   did not participate in the foreign missionary movement until  the twentieth century, this ghostly achievement was entirely the pro- duction of the colonial missionary movement.
 Fourthly, in all the colonies of British settlement, the churches were  engaged as colonisers in the occupation and dispersal of indigenous  peoples, as well as the conquest of earlier European colonisers. In  colonies such as the Cape or New Zealand   where the original popu- lation formed a significant, though minority, population, the Church  originally planted separate missionary and colonial churches, which  arguably facilitated the progress of colonisation and the institutional  management of native people. I have little to say about this, but the  successful creation of new British churches nearly always assumed the  removal or neutralisation of the cultural institutions which preceded  them.
 Finally – and somewhat paradoxically given what I said above about  the way in which the churches helped to preserve older ethnic religious  allegiances – the churches assisted in the generation of new colonial  nationalisms and, eventually, colonial democratic institutions. In all  the territories to which the churches expanded, they found themselves  in competition not only with the members of other British churches,  but also with the adherents of the national churches of other European  powers, including the Dutch Reformed Church   in Cape Colony   and the  French Catholic Church   in what became Canada. Because of the prox- imity of the United States, Canadian Protestantism was heavily influ- enced by its Protestant churches and their independence from those in  the United Kingdom. While the churches were generally among the  most conservative of forces, they also contributed to the creation of the  distinctive religious development of the rising colonial nations.
 To some extent, we will be able to trace these themes through the  colonial missionary movement of the Anglican, Catholic, Anglican  Evangelical, Methodist, Congregational and Presbyterian societies  that are discussed in the next five chapters. Like Dilke, we will ‘follow  England round the world’, telling the largely unknown history of the  colonial missions which played an important role in shaping the cul- tural and religious identity of Greater Britain.
 The first and oldest of the British missionary societies was the Society  for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG  ). It has a major historiography,  which now extends over its full 300-year history to cover the entire  period of the rise and fall of the British empire.  1   This chapter examines  the way in which the Society moulded its original Charter in the nine- teenth century to meet the changing tides of religious and imperial pol- icy. It concentrates on two periods of reform when the SPG was forced to  redefine its role and the mission to British settlers that earlier had been  its most characteristic work. The first was in the 1840s when the launch  of the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund   (1841) sparked renewed enthusiasm  for Anglican expansion into the settler colonies. The second occurred  at the end of the century under the leadership of Henry Hutchinson  Montgomery   (1847–1932), formerly bishop of Tasmania, and Secretary  of the SPG from 1901 to 1918. As Secretary of the SPG in the heyday of  British imperial power, Montgomery was responsible more than anyone  for articulating a coherent ideology for the Anglican missionary move- ment that attempted to unite Christian idealism with British imperial  nationalism. That he failed to win majority support within the British  Anglican communion   for this vision suggests that, even at the height of  the imperial age, colonial missions enjoyed only limited appeal.
 The SPG   was the major foreign missionary organisation for  high church Anglicans in the nineteenth century. However, unlike  Evangelicals who had one society for its foreign missions, the CMS, and  another for its colonial missions, the CCCS, discussed in  Chapter 4 , the  SPG was a hybrid. Two features of the SPG caused controversy in the  nineteenth century, and some confusion even today. In the first place,  there is the overall balance of the SPG’s colonial mission to settlers as 1     D. O’Connor, ed.,  Three Centuries of Mission: The United Society for the Propagation of  the Gospel 1701–2000  (London, 2000); C. F. Pascoe,  Two Hundred Years of the SPG: An  Historical Account of the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, 1701–1900  (London,  1901); H. P. Thompson,  Into All Lands: The History of the Society for the Propagation of  the Gospel in Foreign Parts, 1701–1950  (London, 1951).
 opposed to – or rather in addition to – its foreign mission. Secondly,  there is the Society’s role as the overseas agency of the constitutionally  fused English church and state. Both of these require some qualifica- tion. The charter of the Society gave it a dual character and the SPG  was never exclusively a colonial missionary society. Nevertheless, before  1900, it was the SPG’s missions to European colonists that absorbed a  significant part of its resources and defined its character in relation to  other missionary societies.
 It is useful to try and calculate this more precisely in terms of per- sonnel and funding expended by the SPG on the two branches of its  mission work. The extent of the SPG’s colonial, as opposed to foreign,  mission work varied both from field to field and over time. However,  the SPG missionary roll shows that, between 1701 and 1900, 2,607  or about 60 per cent of all the Society’s ordained missionaries were  sent to the older colonies of North America, as well as Newfoundland    and Canada, Australasia and Europe – regions where they were largely  occupied with missions to colonists. The West Indies   was also a signifi- cant colonial mission for the SPG, especially prior to the end of slave  transportation and the subsequent collapse of the planter economy.  According to Pascoe, there were thirty-seven mission fields where the  SPG’s first-ranked mission work was to colonists as opposed to other  races.  2   Missions to colonists engaged the majority of the 3,059 mission- aries sent to these mission fields, which comprised about 70 per cent  of the entire SPG missionary roll. While these figures do not include  the substantial number of laymen and women agents sent, especially  as schoolteachers, to British North America, these do not affect the  overall picture. In terms of clerical personnel, it can therefore be con- cluded that colonial missions were central to the work of the SPG until  at least 1900.
 Another way to measure the scale of the SPG  ’s investment in colonial  missions is to calculate the funds spent on settler   colonies as opposed to  those conducted elsewhere in the empire.  3   Again, the evidence is rather  mixed. In the eighteenth century, the SPG spent most of its budget in  the American colonies. However, this changed in the nineteenth cen- tury so that an increasing proportion of the Society’s work was redi- rected from colonial to foreign mission work. The shift was gradual.  From 1814 to 1834, the SPG received a parliamentary grant totalling 2     Pascoe,  Two Hundred Years of the SPG , p. 847. See Table 3.2.     3     See Table 3.3 and, for more detail, C. F. Pascoe and H. W. Tucker, eds.,  Classifi ed Digest of the Records of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts,  1701–1892   (London, 1893).
 £241,850, which was mostly expended on clergy salaries in Upper  Canada  . After this grant was abolished, the SPG became much stricter  with the disposal of funds raised by voluntary subscriptions, withdraw- ing grants when it was judged that the colonial churches were capable  of becoming self-supporting. In 1853, however, almost twenty years  after the ending of its parliamentary grant, 31 per cent of the SPG’s  income continued to be spent in British North America.  4   Africa (28.8  per cent) and India (25.5 per cent), where there were recently installed  colonial bishops, were rising in importance and each received about a  quarter of the SPG’s total grant. Australasia (8.3 per cent) and the West  Indies   (4.8 per cent) received less, and the rest of the world very little  (1.1 per cent). In his report, published in the  Missionary Register , where  it was widely read by supporters of other missionary societies, the SPG  Secretary, Ernest Hawkins, stressed the Society’s credentials in rela- tion to ‘strictly Missionary Work among the heathen’. He noted that  wealthier colonies were expected to support themselves, and not draw  on donations made by ‘the working poor of this country’.  5   Nevertheless,  he estimated that the total expenditure by the Society on ‘Missions to  the Heathen’ was about £23,000; after accounting for administrative 4     ‘Gospel-Propagation Society: Report for the 153rd Year’,  Missionary Register  (1854),  p. 499.

 costs this amounted to less than a quarter (24 per cent) of total receipts  for the year of £96,016. In other words, while the SPG was, indisput- ably, both a society for colonial and foreign missions, for much of the  nineteenth century it continued to expend the lion’s share of its income  on settlers, just as it had done in the eighteenth  .
 A second controversial feature of the SPG has been the extent to which  it could and should be identified with the imperial Protestantism of the  British state. Confessional Protestantism was integral to the Society’s  founding principles. The SPG was set up by a layman, Thomas Bray  (1656–1730), as a voluntary association. However its parliamentary  Charter, issued on 16 June 1701, ensured that the Society was intimately  connected to the English state and its established church. The Charter  states that the original purpose of the Society was to protect the king’s  Protestant subjects from Romish priests and Jesuits and prevent popish  superstition and idolatry from taking hold in the American colonies.  6    While this mission naturally evolved in the course of the eighteenth  century, the SPG continued to operate to some extent as the colonial  arm of the Church of England, rather than an independent foreign mis- sionary society like the LMS or the CMS. Through its annual sermons,  the SPG articulated what Rowan Strong has called a ‘vision of Anglican  imperialism’ that promoted the Church of England as a church for the  whole empire, not just Anglicans in England.  7   In order to support this  nation-building work, the SPG raised funds in the United Kingdom  with the authorisation of a letter from the king (which made donations  to the Society appear both pious and patriotic). From 1814 to 1834, it  also received a direct parliamentary grant for clergy salaries in North  America. Nevertheless, the SPG’s entanglement with the British state  gradually unravelled in the course of the nineteenth century. After the  loss of its direct grant, the SPG became heavily reliant on private fund- raising so that it came to resemble more closely the other voluntary  religious societies. And, while some American historians have stressed  its ongoing imperial aspirations, historians from the other side of the  Atlantic have been more sceptical of its influence with the British state.  Porter notes how straitened the resources of the SPG were, and how  unsympathetic the secular authorities were to any attempt to advance  the cause of Anglicanism, which only stirred up resentment among the 6     E.

The Charter is printed in full with commentary in Pascoe,  Two Hundred  Years of the SPG , pp. 932–42.

 The beginning of a fundamental change in the  modus operandi  of the  SPG occurred with the loss of the American colonies and its colonial  churches, which led to a significant decline in its fortunes and prestige.  While it was able to continue its pedestrian work of supporting colonial  chaplains and providing for churches and schools in the settler colonies  of British North America, the West Indies   and Australia  , the SPG was  eclipsed by the glamour and enthusiasm of the second wave of mis- sionary societies. Unlike the SPG, the new societies focused more or  less exclusively on missions to native peoples in Africa, India and the  Pacific. A further trial for the SPG began in the 1830s, during which  the idea of the Church of England as a national Church both at home  and in the colonies came under sustained attack. As liberal reform- ers succeeded in removing many of the traditional entitlements of the  Church, conservative churchmen predicted revolution. In his account  of the rise of the Oxford movement, the theologian William Palmer    (1803–85) called the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts   (1828)  ‘a knife to the heart of the national church’ and the emancipation of  Roman Catholics   which followed in 1829 ‘a measure which scattered to  the winds public principle, public morality [and] public confidence’.  9   In  1833, a new low was reached when the Whig reform parliament pushed  ahead with the rationalisation of the temporalities of the Church of  Ireland  , beginning with the extinction of ten bishoprics and two arch- bishoprics in Ireland.  10   In Ireland, tithes were mostly abolished in 1838,  and later reforms included the civil registration of Protestant marriages  (1845) and the abolition of the parish cess (1864). Overseas, the estab- lished church was also diminished by the removal of subsidies that had  supported colonial clergy in the West Indies, where they were associ- ated with the moral corruption of the slave trade and the decadence and  immorality of plantation life. It could be pointed out that the SPG itself  owned a number of slave plantations, which supported the Society’s  college in Barbados  .
 As the established church lost its institutional privileges, support- ers of the SPG were forced to reassess its missionary role and reconsider 8     Porter,  Religion Versus Empire? , p. 21, arguing against the views of C. Bridenbaugh,   Mitre and Sceptre: Transatlantic Faiths, Ideas, Personalities and Politics  (New York,  1962), p. 57.

 the extent to which the Society should continue to act as the willing or  unwilling agent for hereditary privilege and state power. Indeed, in the  absence of government support for a national church in the colonies, it was  difficult to see what the work of the SPG would be. The logical alterna- tive, namely, the erection of independent Anglican dioceses in the colonies  administered by local bishops, just like the Scottish Episcopal church, was  slow to develop. In the American colonies, there was hostility to Anglican  claims to be the official church. Later there were legal objections to the  consecration of Anglican bishops who were not subjects of the British  crown, but citizens of foreign powers, including the American republic.  11    There were also exaggerated concerns about the apostolic succession   in  cases where congregations elected their own bishops. Nevertheless, the  American Revolution   did clear the way for the creation of the first colonial  bishopric in Nova Scotia  , which was created by letters patent in 1787 in the  wake of the formal separation of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the  United States of America in 1785.  12   Bishops for Quebec (1793), Calcutta  (1814), Jamaica (1824), Barbados (1824), Madras (1835), Australia (1836),  Bombay (1837), Toronto (1839) and Newfoundland (1839) followed, most  of which were funded directly by the government. The support of the SPG  was always assumed to be an interim arrangement that would fade away  when new, self-supporting episcopal churches emerged in the colonies.  Would the SPG soon have no further work to do, other than provide  chaplains for sailors, soldiers and convicts as it had done in the past?
 This was the context for the remarkable revival of the spirituality  and ethos of the colonial mission of the Church of England, which was  reflected in the launch of the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund  , and other  Anglican institutions for the empire, as discussed in Chapter 2. Between  1841 and 1900, the Colonial Bishoprics Council secured £991,388, out  of which it was able to provide part funding for sixty-seven new bish- oprics. Suddenly it was possible to imagine the Church of England as  the Church of the whole empire, led by bishops who were not depend- ent on the government for their authority and income. The Emigrants’  Spiritual Aid Fund was established following reports of the horrific con- ditions endured by refugees from the Irish Famine at home ports and  in North America, and provided an opportunity for the SPG to reassert  its credentials as a missionary body with a duty of care to emigrants. In  both the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund and the Emigrants’ Spiritual Aid 11     This difficulty was overcome by 26 George III, c. 84. For the constitutional reforms  which led to the creation of the Colonial Church, see Pascoe,  Two Hundred Years of the  SPG , pp. 743–57.
 12     See  Table 3.2  for a complete list of Anglican colonial and missionary bishoprics and  the subsidy provided by the SPG.
 Fund, the SPG and the SPCK   took on the role of managing the funds  of these projects and used their expertise and colonial networks to pro- vide them with appropriate institutional support.
 It may be significant that from this time the SPG began to change  the way in which it presented itself to the world. From 1701, there was  a standing order that a sermon was preached before the Society on the  third Friday of every February by a preacher appointed by the President.  Between 1702 and 1901, the sermon was preached by 142 English bish- ops, as well as twenty-nine Welsh, six Irish and five American (US)  bishops and only once – in 1901 – by a colonial bishop, the bishop of  Bombay.  13   Dr G. A. Selwyn, bishop of Lichfield and former bishop of  New Zealand  , preached in 1869. However, in general, the SPG did not  look to the colonial episcopate for guidance, and a paternalistic con- servatism was characteristic of most of its operations. Nevertheless, in  1853, it decided to cease printing the sermon as part of the report of the  SPG. By this date, the winds of change had blown through the vener- able society as resident bishops arrived in colonial dioceses. It seemed  the SPG had new work to do after all and missions to British settlers  were once again on the missionary agenda.
 With the establishment of the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund  , the relation- ship between metropole and colony changed significantly. However, it  took some time before self-governing churches outside the British Isles  emerged. The first step was to cut off, or at least slow down, the flow  of funds as first Canada  , and then the West Indies  , were subjected to  decisions to remove direct funding for SPG   clergy. The SPG responded  effectively by creating a voluntarist   stream of funding independent of  direct aid from the government.  14   The colonial churches also began to  assume control of their own affairs. Provincial synods  , which united the  independent dioceses, were first held in British North America in 1861,  but General Synods were long delayed by Evangelical fears that they  would put too much power in the hands of colonial bishops, the majority  of whom were unsympathetic to their aspirations. General Synods   were  first held in New Zealand   (1859), with Australia   and Tasmania (1872)  and Canada (1893) following in due course. Provinces were also formed  in South Africa   (1870), the West Indies (1883) and Nippon Sei Ko Kai  in Japan (1887). Unlike the clean cut created by the revolutionary breach  with the Americas, the relationship between Canterbury and the col- onies was to be marked by complex and interminable negotiations.  15

 Addleshaw, ‘The Law and Constitution of the Church Overseas’, in  The Mission of the  Anglican Communion , ed. E. R. Morgan and R. Lloyd (London, 1948); and France, Ernest Hawkins and the church in the colonies One of the architects of a new, or at least renewed, mission for the SPG  was the Reverend Ernest Hawkins (1802–68), Fellow of Exeter College,  Oxford, Prebendary of St Paul’s cathedral in London and, from 1843 to  1866, Secretary of the SPG.  16   Hawkins was actively involved in all the  colonial projects of the high church party. Until 1864, he was Secretary  of the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund  ;  17   he was also Secretary of the SPG’s  Emigrants’ Spiritual Aid Fund. He was a member of the committee  of management of the Canterbury Association  , incorporated by Royal  Charter on 13 November 1849, which organised this Anglican colony  in the South Island of New Zealand  , where a river now sustains his  memory.  18   In 1848, Hawkins became the first Secretary of the SPG  to undertake a tour of North America, the most populous of the set- tler colonies and the site of the SPG’s busiest mission. Hawkins wrote  a detailed journal of his tour of duty, during which he visited the four  Canadian bishops of Quebec, Toronto, Fredericton and Nova Scotia.  He then went on to visit the United States and forge links with the  Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Episcopal Church,  publishing a report in the  Missionary Register .  19
 Hawkins was not alone in his plans for the SPG to take a more active  role in laying the foundations for new, more independent,  colonial  churches. In 1849, George William Lyttelton   (1817–76), one-time Under  Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in the Peel Conservative  government and later the major patron of the Canterbury Association,  wrote Hawkins a long letter.  20   Like his brother-in-law William  Gladstone  , Lyttelton was fascinated by the prospects for the ‘national’  (i.e. Anglican) church in the colonies, and did everything he could to  promote this cause.  21   On this occasion, Lyttelton’s main aim was to Oversea Episcopate . For the rise of synodalism   in the colonies, see E. D. Daw, ‘Church  and State in the Empire: The Conference of Australian Bishops 1850’,  Journal of  Imperial and Commonwealth History , 5 (1976), pp. 251–69.

 encourage the SPG to provide better support to emigrants and withdraw  its support from colonies where the churches should be encouraged  to become independent. This was a radical proposition that changed  fundamentally the nature of the relationship between the SPG and the  settler colonies. In an earlier age, one of the SPG’s primary functions  was to support the state, which ensured that the largest supply funds  were supplied to those colonies of greatest strategic significance to the  British crown, in particular British North America. Now, Lyttelton  urged that funding should be supplied according to financial need, and  for as short a time as possible. It was the policy long adopted by the  Methodists in their colonial arrangements, but it was a startling innov- ation for the SPG.
 This summarises effectively the ambitions of the Church of England to  become the national Church in the colonies, a church which was fused  ethnically and politically to the English-speaking people and which  could and should be exported wherever the British empire spread its  settlements.
 Hawkins enhanced the public image of the SPG by launching a  number of new periodicals, including  The Church in the Colonies  and   Missions to the Heathen , later given the collective title of the Colonial 22     S. J. Brown,  Providence and Empire: Religion, Politics and Society in the United Kingdom  1815–1914  (Edinburgh, 2008), pp. 176–8.
 Church Library  ,  24   which popularised the two arms of the Society’s  work. While subsequently eclipsed by  The Mission Field , which began  in 1856 and went on to become the SPG’s best-known periodical, in  the 1840s they ensured that the colonial mission of the SPG received  more effective publicity than it had ever done before. The colonial  church series appears to have begun with a documentary history,  edited by Hawkins, on the work of the SPG in the North American col- onies. Much of this had already been published in the  British Magazine   and in several North American church periodicals. While in Boston  in 1849, Hawkins personally donated a copy to Harvard University  Library.  25   Setting the tone for the more assertive colonial ambitions of  the SPG, Hawkins dedicated this to the American bishops, priests and  deacons ‘in the earnest desire that the mother and daughter churches  may ever remain inseparably knit together in one communion and  fellowship’.  26   The preface warns of the ‘guilt and danger’ of establish- ing colonies  without appropriate religious provisions since ‘the fellow- ship of the Church is the strongest tie between the Mother Country  and her Colonies’.  27   He argued that new responsibilities had opened  up with the expansion of the colonies, which were themselves becom- ing nations, and a Providential call was laid on both the Church and  realm of England to provide the gospel in its most perfect form (which  implies the presence of Anglican bishops) to both heathen lands and  settler colonies.
 There was something a little ingenuous about these claims. The   episcopate of the American Episcopal Church   was generated almost  entirely after its break with the Church of England, and it had its own  missions in the Americas to support. In due course, the American church  created missionary bishops for its westward settlements and missionary  dioceses (initially without bishops) in regions such as Alaska, Hawaii  and the Philippines; American Episcopal bishops for ‘foreign’ churches  within the American political sphere of influence first appeared in  Haiti, Mexico and Spain.  28   While acknowledging historic ties to the  English and Scottish episcopal churches, it did not relish claims for  precedence by the Church in Britain. Perhaps reflecting some of these 24     As advertised in the endpapers of R. W. Norris,  Annals of the Diocese of Adelaide   (London, 1852), by 1852 there were twenty-seven issues in the series.

 Hawkins also prepared  The Colonial Church Atlas   , which illus- trated the worldwide spread of Anglican dioceses, supplemented with  geographical and statistical tables. His stated aim was ‘exhibiting,  in a striking light, the utter inadequacy of her [the Church’s] pre- sent operations in Foreign Parts, and the necessity of a more perfect  organization’.  30   The  Atlas  was, in other words, the charter for a new,  much expanded, role for the SPG and for the Church of England  in the British world. In graphic form, it depicted all the missionary  and colonial dioceses of the empire; British possessions were hand- coloured in red, with churches and missionary stations marked by  crosses. Every map carried a printed stamp with the name of the dio- cese, the coat of arms of the bishop and the date of his consecration.  Even bolder was the large-scale ‘Colonial and Missionary Church  Map of the World’, which was coloured and varnished and showed all  the Anglican dioceses and missionary stations. At six feet six inches  by four feet five inches, this made a suitable purchase for a school- room or church hall, where it would allow the SPG’s supporters to  track where in the world their donations were being spent. Smaller  scale versions were also available that could be folded up into a case.  Neither of these items was cheap: the large map cost thirty-two shil- lings and the pocket ones two shillings apiece.
 Journals of visitation made by the recently despatched colonial bish- ops on their first tours of duty were another voluminous source of infor- mation about the new colonial dioceses. The SPCK   published these  systematically throughout the 1840s.  31   Like the SPG’s maps and atlases,  despatches from the colonial bishops helped to delineate the territory  over which the Society, or rather the Church of England, was making a  spiritual claim. From New Zealand  , George Augustus Selwyn wrote as  though the entire country was vacant land on which he would be able  to place the first Christian imprint: 29     ‘Deputation to America’,  Missionary Register  (1854), p. 495.     30     E. Hawkins,  The Colonial Church Atlas  (London, 1845).     31     The series of twenty-eight bishops’ visitation journals included: Toronto (1842), Quebec (1843, 1846), Nova Scotia, Cape Breton and New Brunswick (1843), New  Zealand (Parts I –V, 1842–4), Australia (1843, 1845), Manéroo (i.e. Monero) and  Moreton Bay, including a map of the Grazing Districts of New South Wales (1843),  Quebec (1843–4), Newfoundland (1845), Fredericton (1845, 1846), Newfoundland  (Parts I–II: 1845, 1846), Nova Scotia (1844, 1845), Labrador (1848), Cape Town  (1848) and Tasmania.
 I find myself placed in a position such as was never granted to any English  Bishop before, with a power to mould the institutions of the Church from the  beginning according to true principles.  32
 This was something of a slight to the Church Missionary Society  , which  had been planted in New Zealand   by Samuel Marsden   in 1814. In a  dramatic series of voyages around his new domain, Selwyn records that  he travelled 1,180 miles by sea, 762 on foot, 86 by horseback, and 249  by boat, making a total of 2,277 miles. He carefully noted the accept- ance of his authority by both Europeans and natives, who assembled to  receive the sacrament of confirmation at his hands: ‘It was a most strik- ing sight to see a church filled with native Christians, ready, at my first  invitation to obey the ordinances of their religion.’  33   In fact, Selwyn was  to lead the Anglican world in democratising the institutions of Anglican  Church governance, but he chose to do so from an  initial assumption  of complete power. The sequence of bishops’  visitation journals formed  the foundation for cloth-bound volumes in the series entitled  Annals  of the Colonial Church , most of which were edited for publication by  Hawkins.  34
 There appear to have been at least two intended audiences for the   Annals of the Colonial Church , a series which functioned as a kind of  encyclopaedic history of the SPG’s renewed colonial mission. One  was the traditional object of all missionary propaganda: the moral  and financial supporters of missionary projects at home, people who  enjoyed reading the lively travel narratives of the colonial bishops but  who had no plans to head to the colonies themselves. It was these kinds  of people who purchased the SPG’s volume on New Zealand  , which  appeared in 1848.  35   This was a characteristic missionary publication,  which drew heavily on correspondence from the field and included  exotic details, such as a series of fine engravings of the Maori   people. It  provided recent news, such as the decision by Governor George Grey    to increase the number of troops resident in New Zealand as a means  to provide ‘added security’ to the colony.  36   There is also a final chapter  and appendix, which gives an account of Bishop Selwyn’s founding of  the theological college of St John’s   to provide training of candidates for 32     G. A. Selwyn,  New Zealand, Part I, Letters from the Bishop to the Society for the  Propagation of the Gospel, Together with Extracts from the Visitation Journal from July  1842 to January 1843  (London, 1844), p. 102.
 holy orders, as well as primary and secondary schooling for native and  European Christians.  37   In all this, there is nothing that might be inter- preted as an inducement to emigrants seeking a country of settlement.  This accorded with the policy of the missionary societies, which were  opposed to European colonisation in the interests of the Maori people,  and resisted all attempts to cede, buy, or sell Maori land. Only after  1840 did the SPG take on a more active role in supporting the needs of  the settler, as well as the Maori, church in New Zealand.  38
 The volumes for Canada   and Australia   are rather different. With their  maps and reports of the visitation of the relevant bishop, always empha- sising the need for greater efforts in both settlement and evangelisa- tion, they have something of the character of handbooks for prospective   emigrants, especially clerical emigrants. The bishop of Fredericton,  New Brunswick, put the call for more men in dramatic italics: ‘I could  find immediate and full employment for twenty additional clergymen,  without diminishing the labours of any one at present in Holy Orders.’  39    It was also a matter of church pride that the English church, which   carried with it the authority of the state and sovereign at home, should  be asserted more firmly than that of what are referred to as the ‘noisy  and importunate sects’ who claimed equality with her in the colony.  40
 In Quebec  , Hawkins was also inspired to a strong call for men and  clergy to meet the challenge of emigration and the ‘great destiny that  seems assigned to them by the will of the Almighty – that of being the  fathers and founders of great and populous empires beyond the seas’.  41    Hawkins wrote these books for the benefit of the people and churches  of the expanding colonies. The final section of Hawkins’ book on the  Quebec diocese concerns the work of clerics ministering to sick, desti- tute and starving emigrants, mostly from Ireland, in the horrific condi- tions of the quarantine station. The cholera epidemics of 1832 devastated  the people of Quebec  , but worse was to come following the catastrophic  failure of the potato crop in Ireland  . Hawkins recognised what followed  as one of the most searing tragedies in human memory. As the famine 37     Recorded in the Appendix are the names of ten graduates of St John’s   who had been  ordained by the bishop of New Zealand. One was the controversial William Colenso  ,  ordained on Sunday, 22 September 1845 to be deacon for the district of Ahuriri. For  the history of St John’s, see A. K. Davidson,  Selwyn’s Legacy: The College of St John the  Evangelist Te Waimate and Auckland 1843–1992  (Auckland, 1993).

 In this account, it is difficult to tell if the bishop was more horrified at  the unprecedented calamity of the famine and the unspeakable suffer- ing he witnessed, or the enforced mingling of Protestant and Catholic  between the same sheets. Indeed, there was much to discourage those  who sought to attend on the sick as many doctors, nurses and clergy  of all religious persuasions fell victim to the epidemic. Of the fifteen  Protestant clergy who served at the quarantine station, five had died  by November of the first famine year. A more concerted programme  of activity for emigrants was the direct consequence of these tragic  events.
 Despite hardships of this kind, the  Annals of the Colonial Church   shows the transformation of the churches under the impact of emigra- tion. They chronicle the new Anglican world arising in the colonies that  the SPG was helping to create.
 The SPG, 1850s–1880s After the heroic expansion of the 1840s and 1850s, the later decades of  the nineteenth century were a period of relative stagnation for the colo- nial mission of the SPG. The success of the appointment of colonial  bishops to their dioceses in some respects removed its  raison d’être . With  bishops located in the colonies, they naturally became more directly  responsible for the raising of funds for church work locally. With the loss  of direct grants   to both British North America, which had amounted  to £16,000 in 1832, and the West Indies  , the settler churches in both the Society’s major fields of operation had been pushed into independ- ence.  44   The loss of funds created frank difficulties, and so it was pos- sibly with some optimism that the bishops reassured each other that  British loyalism – and willingness to support the Church of England –  was undiminished. Most, whatever their original churchmanship, had  to adjust.
 Francis Fulford   (1803–68), first bishop of Montreal, makes an inter- esting case study in the challenges facing colonial bishops in this gen- eration.  45   Like the majority of Canadian bishops, Fulford was a high  churchman. As a protégé of Ernest Hawkins  , he had risen through the  SPG in the 1830s. After the launch of the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund  ,  he had become editor of the  Colonial Church Chronicle and Missionary  Journal ,   which provided an independent voice on colonial church  matters. He expressed editorial disapproval, for example, of the high- handed action of Bishop Nixon of Tasmania, who used his episcopal  authority to dismiss clergymen employed as convict chaplains against  the wishes of the Lieutenant Governor.  46   Fulford was enthroned in  Westminster Abbey on 25 July 1850 with all the dignity of a ducal cor- onation. (Bishops were not called ‘My Lord’ for nothing.) However,  like Broughton in Sydney, Selwyn in New Zealand   and other colonial  bishops of this era, his pretensions to spiritual authority were tempered  by the reality of colonial conditions. Fulford would declare his loyalty,  but privately he surveyed his diocese of mixed Anglophone and French- speaking families and scattered Indian settlements and noted ‘The  people are disunited and few [are] in reality Church people.’  47
 As colonial governments systematically withdrew funding for all  churches throughout much of North America, Australia   and New  Zealand  , the Church of England   was forced to adjust to a new volun- tary regime in which it had to raise its own funding in order to survive.  In these circumstances, some did better than others. In Canada and  Australia, the most successful bishops created Church societies that  took over the function of raising funds that had earlier been provided  by the government and the SPG. The correspondence of the SPG con- tinued to be full of begging letters from colonial bishops. However, 44     The Anglican Church in Jamaica   was disestablished in 1870; it continued in  Barbados.

 the Society showed increasing resolve to demand churches become  self-supporting. Following gold discoveries in New South Wales and  Victoria, no further funds were released to dioceses in these colonies,  although the SPG continued to provide support for frontier regions in  the north and west of Australia. An important effect of the drying up  of funds from home was the impetus that it gave to cooperation with  other dissenting Protestants. As Vaudry has argued, in British North  America  , Anglican Evangelicals cooperated earlier and more effect- ively with other Protestants in church extension work than was pos- sible in Britain. He suggests that this was related to the Irish, rather  than English, roots of many Anglican clergy in Quebec who were  therefore more likely to support closer affiliation with other evangelical  churches.  48   This takes us back to Fulford. In Montreal, Fulford dis- covered that the decline of the SPG had created opportunities for the  Evangelical Colonial Church and School Society  , who from 1851 began  planting schools in his diocese. In Quebec  , Mountain resolved against  cooperation with the Colonial Church and School Society, which he  saw as a source of disunity.  49   In contrast, given the shortage of person- nel, Fulford   found that his only option was collaboration. His sermons  and addresses consistently stressed the complementary Catholic and  Evangelical traditions of the Church of England and the practical real- ity that fund-raising and personnel would have to be raised locally if the  church were to flourish in Canada.  50   This conclusion was reached by  many of Fulford’s contemporaries around the Anglican world.
 In 1901, the SPG   celebrated its bicentenary but was rather disap- pointed by the poor show at some of its events. It was showing its age  and struggling to retain the support of all sections of the Church, which  it needed to finance its work throughout the empire. The high church    party, which was an important supporter of the venerable Society, had  risen in importance to become the most influential group within the  Church of England. However, the religious mainstream was wearied by  decades of controversy about the revival of Catholic forms of ritual in  Anglican churches and controversy generated by radical Evangelicals 48     Vaudry, ‘Evangelical Anglicans and the Atlantic World’, p. 9.

 on one wing and radical Anglo-Catholics   on the other. Mission pri- orities were changing and those high churchmen who felt enthusiasm  for mission work could choose to channel their funds and energy into  either the new Anglo-Catholic societies, which focused on native work  in Africa and the Pacific, or the Evangelical CMS, which now had affil- iated societies in many of the colonies as well. Many Evangelicals con- sidered that the SPG was marginal to the real missionary work, which  was aimed at non-British Christians, not British settlers who could look  after themselves. Even the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund  , once seen as the  key to the full establishment of the Church of England throughout the  world, was struggling. A sub-committee of the Colonial Bishoprics  Council   reported in 1895 that because of low interest it was proving  impossible to avoid vacancies in a number of sees.  51
 It was proving equally difficult to raise financial support for colonial  projects such as schools, once the mainstay of colonial missionary work.  In 1898, the Reverend T. St John Perry Pughe   wrote to archbishop  Temple   seeking his support for the establishment of an Anglican gram- mar school for boys in Brisbane, bemoaning that the ‘average English  Churchman seems callous to our needs. He has the idea we are a land  of gold, not knowing that nearly all the wealth is owned by large English  Companies, or has been taken out of the colony by successful colonists  who in England ignore Colonial responsibilities.’  52   Temple responded  that it seemed like a case that should be supported from the resources  of the colony.  53   Instead of turning to Britain for financial aid, many  argued that the colonial churches should be taking more responsibil- ity not only for their own support but also for foreign missions in their  regions. As the cause of foreign missions continued to rise, and that of  colonial missions declined, Pughe was not alone in feeling abandoned  by the empire. In 1896, in rural New South Wales, Bishop Anderson   of  Riverina complained that, with only fifteen clergy for a sparsely settle  diocese as large as Great Britain, his people were lapsing into ‘prac- tical heathenism’. One of his people expressed his sense of grievance in  terms of racial resentment: 51     Brochure outlining accounts of the Colonial Bishoprics Council. Report of a  Subcommittee Appointed May 17, 1895, in Lambeth Palace Library, Temple Papers,  vol. 7, fol. 297.
 53     Pughe appears to have played no part in the establishment of the existing Brisbane  Church of England Grammar School, which was founded in 1917 by Canon William  Perry French Morris (1878–1960). See entry on Morris by John Cole,  Australian  Dictionary of Biography , vol. 15, pp. 415–17.
 White men   were no longer a missionary cause. The SPG expected  the colonial churches to manage independently, and lacked the will and  the resources to do more.
 While everything Montgomery did appears to flow spontaneously  from his own warm feelings, he was a successful and strategic pub- licist for the colonial mission of the SPG. Very early, he seems to  have hit upon the idea that the best way to advance the colonial cause  was to marry it to the ideology of British imperialism. In Australia  ,  Montgomery was fired by the promise of Federation and the Jubilee of  the Australasian Board of Mission   (ABM), an organisation which grew  out of the Australasian bishops’ conference in 1850, but had remained  more or less moribund for many years after that. Roused by federation  and imperialism, he enthused: ‘I do not know what we might not do.’  61    By promoting church work as part of an imperial mission, Montgomery  sought to create a winning formula for raising funds, expanding the  range of projects that the SPG might attempt, and re-staking the claim  that the Church of England was the Church of the empire.
 Montgomery was not alone in seeing imperial nationalism as an  effective vehicle for rallying missionary enthusiasm, nor was the SPG  entirely uncritical in its endorsement of the imperial cause. Other mis- sionary societies, as we will see in later chapters, were attracted to the  language and ideals of empire loyalty. In 1892, the Church Missionary  Society   decided to despatch a colonial deputation, led by Eugene Stock  ,  the Editorial Secretary, and Reverend R. W. Stewart, in order to visit 57     Montgomery to Davidson, 12 July 1899, in Lambeth Palace Library, Davidson  Papers, vol. 519.
 Australasia and Canada and promote the establishment of  missionary  auxiliaries who would raise funds and send out missionaries of their own,  independently of the home society. Writing for the  Church Missionary  Intelligencer , George Ensor, later known as the first English missionary  to Japan, described the work of the delegation as nothing less than a  renewal of the bond that had drawn Australians to fight for Britain in  the Sudan: It was no mere vulgar hatred of the Arab race that unsheathed the Australian  sword. It was not coarse love of gain, nor even craving for renown. It was to  demonstrate the glorious principle of Imperial Unity. It was the love of the  Motherland. It was for this idea that our colonial kinsmen died.  62
 As Stock and Stewart set sail, Ensor rejoiced that they would be  calling  Australians to serve a cause, which he described as nobler even than  the unity of the Anglo-Saxon   race or the imperial federation   of Great  Britain’s colonies: the communication of the gospel to the whole world.  Such calls to imperial unity helped to ease the difficulty that the  new CMS auxiliaries would be setting themselves up as rivals to the  Australasian Board of Missions and the work of the SPG.
 SPG:  The East and the West The East and the West  was a quarterly journal of the SPG, which,   following Montgomery’s plan, outlined issues arising in missions ‘both  in the colonies and amongst the heathen’.  63   For Montgomery, the empire  provided the supporting frame for both aspects of the Society’s signa- ture dual mission. The colonial mission was showcased in two articles  entitled, ‘The Imperial Claims of the SPG’  64   and ‘The Function of the  Colonial Churches in Our Missionary Expansion’, which were written  by Alfred Barry   (1826–1910), the former bishop of Sydney and Primate  of Australia  . Stuart A. Donaldson  , brother of the high church bishop  of Brisbane, contributed another on the colonial theme with a piece on  education in South Africa  . Barry provided a defence of the SPG’s colo- nial mission, pointing out that according to the SPG charter the needs 62     George Ensor, ‘The Message of Australia to England’,  Church Missionary Intelligencer   (April 1892), p. 248. For the later missions of the CMS in Australia, see A. Barry,  ‘The Function of the Colonial Churches in Our Missionary Expansion’,  The East  and the West: A Quarterly Review for the Study of Missions , 1 (1903), p. 185; K. Cole,  A  History of the Church Missionary Society of Australia  (Melbourne, 1971).
 It was otherwise with Donaldson, who makes a bravura case for the  SPG facilitating Anglo-supremacy in Africa.  66   Quoting Cecil Rhodes    (‘It takes a man five years to see South Africa  , ten years to love it and  fifteen years to know it’), Donaldson bemoaned the financial problems  of South Africa, where ‘The Church’ was not a majority institution with  substantial endowments but the sect of an ethnic enclave. He regretted  that stipends for the clergy were pitifully low (‘less than may be earned  by a respectable butler’), and schools were especially under-resourced.  67    Donaldson’s article was a more or less blatant pitch for funds to sup- port Anglo-imperialism   in South Africa   by funding Anglican Church  schools for boys, including the Diocesan College at Rondebosch in  Cape Town, St Andrew’s College at Grahamstown and Michaelhouse  at Balgowan in Natal. From these schools, Donaldson, himself an old  Etonian, boasted that boys went forth to rule the empire  : carrying with them all over the country the traditions and tone and charac- teristics of the English Public School, the joyousness of life, the love of sport,  and above all that intense desire to see fair play and the ‘run straight’, which  is so ingrained a feature in the English character, and to which England owes  so much.  68
 There was also some execrable poetry in praise of the religious call of  the colonies, which was contributed by George Alexander Chadwick  ,  bishop of Derry and Raphoe (1896–1916). One verse (there are five  more) is probably sufficient to demonstrate the bishop’s gifts in this  direction. Chadwick called it ‘The Exiles’: 65     Barry, ‘Function of the Colonial Churches’, p. 185.     66     Donaldson, ‘Education in South Africa’.     67      Ibid ., p. 392.    68      Ibid ., p. 395.     69     Pascoe,  Two Hundred Years of the SPG , p. 774a, notes that the colleges mentioned by Donaldson had been funded by the SPG to provide pathways to the ministry for both  native and colonial youth.
 This poem recalls earlier ventures in verse, such as the poetic greet- ing prepared by Barron Field   (1786–1846), a judge in the New South  Wales Supreme Court, for the LMS delegation of the Reverend Daniel  Tyerman and George Bennet  , who came to Sydney in 1825 after tour- ing the Society’s Pacific missions.  71   On that occasion, Field pleaded  that the visitors consider the needs of colonists as much as those of hea- then Pacific Islanders – lest the Tahitian should learn to know Christ  better than the ‘Austral Colonist’. Both poems lent a heroic glow to the  pioneers who tamed the wilderness, ploughed the prairie, created set- tlements and civilisation and ensured that the British flag was flown  whenever and wherever convenient. In all these contributions, the crea- tion of a Christian church in the colonies was seen as synonymous with  other empire-building work.
 A more jingoistic interpretation of the work of the SPG was written  by a layman, H. C. Richards  , in an article that credited the SPG with  both ‘building up Imperial unity’ and ‘a greater Church of England  in a Greater Britain  ’.  72   Richards begins by admitting that the mission- ary character of the SPG repelled many, without, he says, who did not  understand what the SPG did. He went on to justify support for the  Society on the ground that it alone had the capacity to unite the English  race throughout the empire. Because it helped to lift up imperial pat- riotism, Richards argued that it was a vital work that should appeal  to many who felt no sympathy for missions to the heathen. There  was also a mystical side to the appeal to empire. In Richard’s view,  those who attended Anglican Church services formed a continuous  chain: ‘binding Englishmen all over the world to the Mother Land, and  connecting them with the services of the old parish church in the vil- lages and towns which they had left behind them.’  73   Such views, which 70     G. A. Chadwick [Bishop of Derry and Raphoe], ‘The Exiles’,  The East and the West: A  Quarterly Review for the Study of Missions , 1 (1903), pp. 241–2.
 emphasised the extent to which the Church of England was a vehicle for  national and imperial pride as much if not more than Christian fellow- ship, were always more marked in the SPG than in the publications of  any other colonial missionary society. While the movement to establish  the Church of England as a national Church in the colonies ended in  failure, it did live on in Anglican contexts such as this.
 If we review the volume as a whole, it is clear that the contribu- tions on settler religion and its mission opportunities were already  becoming anachronistic. In the colonies themselves, the call of the  empire was being transmuted into the call of the bush. The ‘bush  brotherhoods’   were an initiative of Nathaniel Dawes  , which were cre- ated after the 1897 Lambeth Conference.  74   Eventually, seven bush  brotherhoods were established in Australia   where they had an import- ant impact on the colonial church; at least thirteen brothers went on  to become bishops.  75   They were a practical and flexible response to  the need for a committed and mobile clergy to work on the colonial  frontier. There were other challenging calls for the indigenisation of  the missionary and the colonial churches. Compared with Richards’  sentimental jingoism about the empire, it is startling to read the cri- tique of Herbert Hamilton Kelly   (1860–1950), a young missionary  who had only recently returned from South Africa   and who would  later go on to found the Society of the Sacred Mission.  76   Before there  could be a self-supporting native church, Kelly argued, it was neces- sary for English workers to withdraw. Quoting from missionaries who  expressed the lowest opinions of native industry, duty and morality, he  argued that the major cause of the lingering dependence of missions  in South Africa lay in an unwillingness to let go of English institutions  and let things be done in a truly native fashion. Here Kelly appears  to be reflecting Venn’s view of the evolution of the self-governing  church,  77   one in which English missionaries would be redundant.  Nevertheless, it would be another generation or two before this radi- cal proposal became a reality for any church outside Greater Britain  .  The outbreak of war in South Africa   revealed how fragile the imperial  consensus really was.
 Enlistment to the colonial mission Although it was becoming unfashionable, the colonial mission of the  Church of England continued to attract new recruits. To enlist them,  there was a need for promotional material  . Bishop Montgomery   pro- duced this for the SPG in some quantity.  78   The SPCK   also published  colonial clergy memoirs which served the dual role of celebrating the  achievements of colonial pioneers and providing information for those  with a vocation for an overseas mission, whether to emigrants or to  the heathen.  79   At the University of Cambridge, there was a series of  lectures delivered by John Richardson Selwyn   (1844–98), Master of  Selwyn College, and a former bishop of Melanesia, at the request of  the Theological Board as the Pastoral Lectures for 1896.  80   As Selwyn  explained, these were intended for undergraduates, ‘some of whom  might possibly go out to the Colonies, or to the Mission Field’, and to  give them the benefit of his own experience. In fact, it was enthusiastic  propaganda for the colonial mission. Selwyn was not a recruiting agent  for the SPG’s colonial mission, and yet he supported it as the natural,  indeed morally imperative extension of British temporal rule overseas.
 Nevertheless, Selwyn stated that public indifference was matched by  an even greater indifference on the part of the Church, exacerbated  by the reluctance of the British government to endow bishoprics. The  answer to this problem was the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund   that ‘sowed 78     H. H. Montgomery,  Handbook on Foreign Mission  (London, 1902); H. H. Montgomery,   Service Abroad  (New York, Bombay and Calcutta, 1910).
 80     J. R. Selwyn,  Pastoral Work in the Colonies and the Mission Field  (London, 1902).     81      Ibid ., p. 6.
 Bishops broadcast throughout the Colonies’.  82   In a few lines Selwyn  sketched the factors that transformed the English-speaking colonies  into fields for settlement. In brief, these were steam, gold and finally  wool. Missionaries were needed to ensure that the British empire was a  Christian empire, not simply a commercial and technological marvel.
 In his subsequent lecture, Selwyn pointed out the important dis- tinction between the English church and the Church in the colonies  that arose because of the lack of any preference for the Anglican com- munion  . Not only did the colonies lack an established church, Roman  Catholicism and Nonconformity were strong rivals to the Church of  England. Selwyn also highlighted the failure of the original system of  appointing bishops by letters patent in the Church of England, drawing  on the experience of his own father.  83   On the character of the colonists,  Selwyn is warm, speaking of their materialism, but also their openness  to new things, all experienced in the delightful climate. The other side  to this was that the inducements to the external life made it less likely to  find intellectualism and spiritual men out there. Selwyn used this as an  argument in favour of continued recruiting from home: ‘And therefore’,  Selwyn argues, ‘it is that the supply of men from the old country, and  especially from our Universities, becomes so important.’  84   Cambridge  and Oxford might provide the leaven, while the colonist, who Selwyn  calls ‘essentially a man of sport and pleasure’, would supply the physical  and the material inducements to develop the colonial church.

Whether colonial and con- tinental missions should be relegated with home missions rather than  with the higher status work of direct evangelisation of the heathen in  foreign lands had, by the first decade of the twentieth century, become  irrelevant. Immigration was ensuring that home and foreign mission  works were becoming increasingly entangled. Colonial Anglicans, who  had once been the object of the missionary attentions of the SPG, had  become missionaries in their own right. As Pascoe put it: ‘Seed sown by  the foreign missionary is bringing forth fruit in city and home mission  fields, while the labours of those at home find their results in far distant  lands.’  90   For the SPG, it was the end of a long run and an explanation  for the demise of what had been an important part of its work for the  best part of 200 years.
 The colonial mission of the SPG   was still active at the end of the nine- teenth century, but it was increasingly being submerged beneath the  more urgent claims of its missions to non-Europeans. The rise and fall  of the SPG’s work with settlers reflects in large measure the rise and fall  of British colonisation. Its later influence was probably extended by the  effectiveness of Montgomery in linking the work of the SPG, including  its colonial mission  , to imperialism. While other missionary societies  also saw the benefit of banging the imperial drum in order to seek funds  for their missionary operation, the SPG was probably more open to 1863 a  Goulburn 1898 a  Tinnevelly and Madura 1864 a  Western Equatorial Africa 1898 a  New Guinea 1866 a  Dunedin 1898 Mombasa a       This signifies that the Society has planted or supported Missions which now form  a part of the diocese.

 the idea than others, if only because imperialism had been a part of  the ideology of the Society from the time of its foundation. That being  said, the SPG was not entirely bound by its history of engagement with  the British state. As the Church of England was reformed in the course  of the nineteenth century, it came increasingly to model the national  Church that Coleridge   had elevated to a cultural and spiritual ideal.  More problematic for the Society was its identification with the most  old-fashioned work of the Church, that to colonists, which restricted its  appeal to Anglican donors and potential missionaries. In addition, from  the 1830s, it had a rival for the provision of services to Anglican settlers,  namely, the organisation that would eventually call itself the Colonial  and Continental Church Society   which will be considered in  Chapter  5 . Both of these Anglican societies were products of a Protestant nation  that privileged the Church of England. In the colonies, there was little  or no establishment and colonial missionary societies that supported  the extension of Catholic and Nonconformist churches were a startling  innovation without precedent in the United Kingdom. The SPG had  been founded to defend the faith in the new world. Over the next four  chapters, we will consider the spiritual empires that grew to rival the  Church of England and the challenge these posed to the original mis- sion of the SPG, beginning with the Catholic Church and its mission- ary auxiliary, the Association for the Propagation of the Faith.
 This chapter considers the paths by which the Catholic Church  was extended into British colonies in the nineteenth century and  the relationship between the settler churches and the various com- peting sources of clerical personnel and influence in England,  Ireland, France and Rome. Mostly, this involves explaining how  Irish Catholicism   came to dominate the Catholic Church through- out much of the settler British world. Some of this covers familiar  territory: historians have long been aware of the role played by Paul  Cullen   (1803–78), first as rector of the Irish College in Rome and  then in Ireland as archbishop of Armagh and subsequently of Dublin,  in stamping a ‘Roman mould’ on the Catholic Church in Australia    and New Zealand  .  1   Other British colonies, particularly those in North  America, were more successful in defending themselves from falling  entirely within the Irish orbit.  2   However, both the Australasian case  and the American counter-examples need to be set within a global  context that was more extensive than the British empire. As we will  see, the ethnic and political profile of colonial Catholicism depended  on the interaction of three forces: the Sacred Congregation for the  Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda  ) – the bureaucracy within the  Roman Curia which appointed missionary bishops and had respon- sibility for the conduct of missions; the hierarchies of the resurgent 1     For biographical accounts of Cullen, see D.

 Catholic Church in England and Ireland who corresponded about the  supply of colonial clergy; and the Association for the Propagation of  the Faith   (Oeuvre de la propagation de la foi) – the missionary auxil- iary which coordinated fund-raising and publicity for Catholic over- seas missions.  3   Other important figures were the rectors of the major  seminaries   in Rome and Ireland and the heads of the religious orders  who recruited and trained personnel for the mission field.
 Colonial missions to British colonies came to be an important source  of Irish national pride, a means to build a spiritual empire that would  form some compensation for Ireland’s poverty and centuries of colo- nial subjection to Britain. In the face of ongoing Protestant hostility,  they were also opportunities to demonstrate Catholic commitment to  empire and nation-building in the colonies. While never pro-British,  the Catholic colonial mission represented the most significant Irish  investment in the empire that British enterprise opened up to Catholic  settlement.
 Catholics in Britain and Ireland Looking at the conditions for Catholics in Britain at the beginning of  the nineteenth century, few people could have predicted that they had  the capacity to staff and resource a Catholic missionary movement in  the British empire. Until the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in  England (1850), Catholics regarded England, Wales and Scotland as  mission territories. Indeed, Scotland remained so until as late as 1878.  Vicars apostolic not only managed local churches; they also worked and  prayed for the reconversion of Protestant Britain to Roman Catholicism.  4    This was not a terribly realistic ambition given the small Catholic popu- lations of England, Wales and Scotland and the numerical and cultural 3     It is now one of four worldwide pontifical mission-aid societies. J. Waldersee,  A Grain  of Mustard Seed: The Society for the Propagation of the Faith and Australia  , 1837–1977   (Sydney, 1983) provides a history of the Society’s activities in Australia. For the influ- ence of the  Oeuvre  in defending missionaries in the French colonial empire, see J.  P. Daughton,  An Empire Divided: Religion, Republicanism, and the Making of French  Colonialism, 1880–1914  (Oxford, 2006), p. 256.
 4       A note on terminology: Catholics in Protestant countries as well as those in non- Christian territories were organised as ‘missions’ which were administered not by  resident bishops but by ecclesiastical administrators with the rank, but not the local  territorial title, of a bishop. Depending on the standing of the missionary territory,  missions were organised as prefectures (headed by a ‘Prefect Apostolic’) or vicariates  (headed by a ‘Vicar Apostolic’). If appropriate, these might later advance to become  dioceses (led by a bishop) and ultimately metropolitan archdioceses (led by an arch- bishop). See Table 4.2, Chronology of Catholic dioceses in Britain and settler colonies  up to 1908.
 supremacy of Protestantism at all levels of British society. At the time  of the 1851 Census of Religious Worship  , held after the impact of post- famine emigration from Ireland to mainland Britain had swelled their  numbers, Catholics made 365,430 attendances at services in England  and Wales, amounting to only 3.5 per cent of total attendances in all  churches.  5   In Scotland, the relative proportion of Catholics in the popu- lation was a little higher, but Catholic attendances there were still only  4.6 per cent of the Scottish total.
 It was reasonable to anticipate more from Ireland, where Catholics  made up the majority of the population. But Ireland was a poor coun- try and it made no significant investment in foreign missions until  the twentieth century.  6   Nevertheless, unlike England, Scotland and  Wales, Ireland had at least retained its Catholic hierarchy. The Irish  Church was supplied with priests who were trained in seminaries in  France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Rome, as well as members of  the religious orders, including Jesuits  , Dominicans   and Franciscans  ,  who also received their formation on the continent.  7   Emmet Larkin    has suggested that, before the middle of the nineteenth century, the  number of clergy in Ireland remained relatively small.  8   However, far  from being cowed by the penal times, the Catholic Church in Ireland  retained sufficient clerical and cultural resources to resist the ‘Second  Reformation’ by zealous, well-funded English and Scottish Protestants  in the 1820s.  9   Catholic emancipation in 1829 gave respectability to  Catholic ambitions for a fuller role in British society at home, and  sowed the seeds for imperial expansion based on the clerical resources  of Ireland. At the same time, it fanned the f lames of sectarianism  ,  especially in western Scotland where it was linked to resentment of  Irish emigrant labour.  10

 Catholics in the British empire The outward movement of Catholics into the colonies of the British  empire was a radical change for English and Irish Catholics, who played  little part in earlier colonising movements to the Americas. There were  one or two Catholic colonisation experiments in the British empire,  of which the colony of Maryland  , which was established by George  Calvert   (first Lord Baltimore) in 1634, is the best known. However,  Maryland was not actually planted as a Catholic colony: it was simply  the first English territory where Catholics enjoyed religious toleration.  11    A small population of Catholics continued to live in Maryland, which  came to develop close links with the English Jesuits  ; there were more  Catholics in Pennsylvania  , Virginia and New Jersey. By the second  half of the nineteenth century, when large-scale Irish emigration was  encountering resistance in the United States, the example of Maryland  was extolled by organisations such as the Irish Catholic Colonization  Society  . According to a promotional history written by John Lancaster  Spalding  , the first Catholic bishop of Peoria in Illinois, colonisation was  a part of ‘the spirit of every age’ and religious colonisation, including the  Catholic colonisation of Maryland, was integral to the development of  the United States.  12   Nevertheless, the reality of religious animosity from  mainstream Protestantism, coupled with low levels of Catholic emigra- tion, ensured that Catholics were a minor force in English-speaking  North America until the middle of the nineteenth century. Elsewhere  in the empire, Catholics may have been proscribed commissions in the  military and civil service, but this did not mean they were unable to  work for the empire of British capitalism.  13   As we noted in  Chapter 2 ,  the East India Company   engaged Catholic chaplains to cater for the  religious needs of Irish who served in large numbers in India.  14
 Until the French Revolution interrupted its imperial expansion,  it was not Irish but rather French Catholicism   that left the largest  imprint on colonial territories under British rule. Four British col- onies had sizeable French-speaking Catholic populations, including  Lower Canada (surrendered to the British under the Treaty of Paris  (1763)), Newfoundland   (whose status was left unresolved by the Treaty 11     W.

 of Utrecht (1713)), Mauritius   and Madagascar  . In Canada, the his- tory of the Catholic   Church has been characterised as a bipolar tussle  between Gallicanism   and Romanism, which was not resolved until the  end of the nineteenth century when the arrival of significant numbers  of emigrants from Germany, Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania inter- nationalised the Church.  15   From early in the nineteenth century, the  Catholic Church was the most powerful institution in Lower Canada.  It had its own metropolitan, full institutional church, including mis- sionary orders who served both settlers and the native people, and  a history of heroic missionary effort among the American Indians.  Thus fortified, the Catholic Church was well placed to mount effect- ive resistance to encroachment by both the French – and later the  British – colonial governments. Although always divided between  Francophones and Anglophones, the Catholic Church was by far the  largest church in Canada by the time of the 1871 census, with almost  three times the number of adherents of its closest Protestant rival, the  Methodists.  16
 The Irish and Scottish Catholics   who arrived in Upper Canada    and the Maritime Provinces   brought out their own clergy with their  communities. Until 1840, Scottish Catholics in particular played an  important role in church-building in both Prince Edward Island and  Nova Scotia. However, French-speaking colonists were ministered  to by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate  , known as the Missionaries of  Provence and, more romantically, as ‘the Apostles of the North-West’.  17    The order was founded in France by St Eugene de Mazenod   in 1816,  and it played a key role in mission work among Europeans and native  people in the North-Western Territory. It was the first religious order to  arrive in Montreal after the British conquest of Quebec   and fifteen of  its members went on to become pioneer bishops.  18   French Catholicism  also impinged on British interests in the Pacific. In New Zealand  , both  French and English missionaries preceded British colonisation (1840);  until then, French Marist Fathers   were authorised by Propaganda to  establish their own vicariate focusing on the Maori   and French col- onists. Although eventually outnumbered by Irish Catholic settlers  and Irish religious teaching orders such as the Marist and Christian  Brothers, the French continued to play a role in both New Zealand and 15     T. J. Fay,  A History of Canadian Catholics: Gallicanism, Romanism, and Canadianism   (Montreal, 2002).
 Indirectly, the French Revolution   may have been responsible for the  reorientation of English Catholicism away from Europe and the old  battle between Catholic and Protestant powers, and towards the fresh  fields of the British empire. Before the Revolution, English Catholics  were closely associated with the university at Douai   in France which  provided a steady stream of missioners whose goal was and remained  the reconversion of the English people to the Roman Catholic faith.  However, in 1793, during the Reign of Terror, most of the foreign clergy  in France were imprisoned and their property confiscated. On their  release and return to England as refugees in 1795, the plight of the  English Benedictines   attracted considerable sympathy and it was nat- ural to turn to them for leadership of the English mission.  21   Possibly, the  forced return of all the religious orders helped redirect the thoughts of  Catholics in both England and Ireland beyond the missions in Britain  and Ireland to the colonial diaspora.
 A key figure in the creation of a new spirit of English Catholic mis- sion overseas was the Benedictine William Poynter   (1762–1827), who  had been prefect of studies at the English College   in Douai. As vicar  apostolic of London District (1812–27), Poynter’s responsibilities  included the coordination of the appointment of Catholic chaplains  working in Britain’s colonies – an unofficial Catholic counterpart to  the management of the Anglican ‘oversea episcopate’ by the bishop of  London  . Propaganda generally attempted to avoid antagonising colo- nial governments about ecclesiastical appointments, especially in cases  where Catholics lived under Protestant regimes. Poynter’s corres- pondence and diary show the important role he played in negotiating  arrangements for Catholic overseas missions to British settlers in North 19     J.

Bellenger, ‘The English Benedictines and the British Empire’, in  Victorian Churches and Churchmen: Essays Presented to Vincent  Alan McClelland , ed. S. Gilley (Woodbridge, Suffolk, 2005), pp. 94–109; P. Cunich,  ‘Archbishop Vaughan and the Empires of Religion in Colonial New South Wales’, in   Empires of Religion , ed. H. M. Carey (Houndmills, 2008), pp. 137–60.
 At the beginning of the nineteenth century, there was no question of  Propaganda making appointments direct to British colonies and bypass- ing either the colonial governors or the administration in Westminster.  In 1817, the Irish Cistercian, Jeremiah O’Flynn   (1788–1831), arrived in  the colony of New South Wales claiming – possibly with  justification –  to have been appointed prefect apostolic with authority from Rome  to begin a missionary apostolate among the Catholic convict popu- lation, and also – with no justification at all – to have obtained the  permission of the Colonial Secretary, Lord Bathurst  , for this purpose.  Governor Lachlan Macquarie   checked the facts and promptly had him  ejected.  23   Nevertheless, one of the first fruits of a new British spirit  of toleration towards Catholics in the empire was manifested in 1818  when Propaganda, following Poynter’s suggestion, created a vicariate  apostolic which covered much of the British sphere of influence in the  southern hemisphere. The English Benedictine, Edward Bede Slater    (1774–1832), became vicar apostolic with responsibility for a daunting  expanse of territory which included Mauritius, Madagascar, the Cape  Colony   and ‘surrounding islands’ (including the island continent of  Australia  ). Fortunately, he came to an agreement that allowed him to  reside in Mauritius   though, like other bishops, he made efforts to tour  the bounds of his diocese. Propaganda may have assigned the vicari- ate to the English Benedictines   partly because they could provide a  supply of English clergy whose earlier training in their motherhouse of  Douai gave them a good command of French.  24   Later in the century,  Mauritius   was also significant for the role of Sir John Pope Hennessy    (1834–91), the first Catholic to be appointed as governor of a British 22     Catholic Colonial Missions [Correspondence from Overseas Missions to Bishop  William Poynter, Westminster Cathedral Archives, 1803–1827] (East Ardsley,  Wakefield: Microform Academic Publishers, no date),  www.microform.co.uk/aca- demic/ .

 colony. As Governor of Sierra Leone   and Barbados, he went on to take  responsibility for large populations of emancipated black slaves as well  as Catholics. As Governor of Hong Kong, his liberal sympathies and  abhorrence of slavery created conflict with settler elites.  25   The policy  solution pursued by the Colonial Office in Mauritius  , soon pursued  effectively elsewhere in the empire, was to provide financial support  for Catholic chaplains  , tolerate a Catholic hierarchy that could dem- onstrate its loyalty, and appoint governors with the capacity for reli- gious and racial toleration. Order – not Catholic advancement – was the  object of this policy, but the expansion of British Catholic colonialism  was one of its consequences.
 From about 1820, the Catholic vicar general in London, like his  Anglican counterpart, began to find it increasingly difficult to find suf- ficient Catholic clergy to serve the expanding Catholic populations in  colonies and military bases overseas. If there were no English clergy  available for colonial duties – which was often the case – the vicar apos- tolic wrote to his brother bishops in Ireland to try to secure the neces- sary appointments. This was the strategy taken by Poynter in response  to a request from the Colonial Secretary, Lord Bathurst  , to find two  Roman Catholic clergymen for New South Wales to augment the two  Irish priests already in place. On discovering that he could find no  priest in England who was willing to go, Poynter wrote to James Doyle  ,  bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, to see if there were any young men in  the Carlow   diocesan seminary who could take up the appointments.  His letter conveyed the wish, firmly expressed to him by Lord Bathurst,  ‘that those who are to be sent should be men who would confine them- selves solely to their religious duties’.  26   In 1826, having secured Roger  Murphy and Daniel Power for the mission, Poynter wrote to them and  stressed Bathurst’s direction that colonial clergy behave with discretion  and: ‘merit the confidence and respect of the constituted authorities’.  27    In return for sticking to religion and not – by implication – straying into  Irish activism, Catholic chaplains   received a stipend of £100 per annum  as well as free passage to the colony. All seemed set for the development  of a low-key Catholic presence in the southern colonies, which would be 25     D. Lambert and P. Howell, ‘John Pope Hennessy and the Translation of “Slavery”  between Late Nineteenth-Century Barbados and Hong Kong’,  History Workshop  Journal , 55 (2003), pp. 1–24.
 led by English Benedictines and staffed by an Irish clerical proletariat.  This, at least, seems to have been the idea of the English Benedictines.
 The situation in Cape Colony   can illustrate the changing fortunes of  the English Benedictine mission to Catholics in the southern colonies,  the rise of Irish influence and the overall pattern of expanding toleration  for colonial Catholicism.  28   From 1652 to 1795, the Dutch East India  Company   had maintained a complete prohibition on the presence of  Catholic clergy in the Cape.  29   After 1804, the Batavian Republic allowed  a number of priests to be sent from Holland to meet the needs of Catholic  soldiers in the garrison. However, in 1806, the British insisted on their  return under the terms of the surrender. Although there was an Irish  priest in the colony when Edward Bede Slater   OSB, vicar apostolic of  Cape of Good Hope (1818–31), visited in 1819, he received no stipend  from the government. The small size and the poverty of the Catholic  community – who retained control of all church property – led the resi- dent priest into dire financial straits, and, in 1824, he returned to Ireland  in disgrace. Partly for this reason, but mostly because of the strength of  both the Dutch Reformed and English Protestant churches in the Cape,  the Catholic community remained small and vulnerable. The manage- ment of the Catholic community was only regularised with the arrival  of the Irish Dominican, Patrick Raymond Griffith  , who became the  first resident Catholic bishop of the Cape vicariate.  30   It was an indica- tion of changing times that the negotiations for Griffith’s appointment  as Catholic chaplain with a stipend of £200 were handled not by the  London vicar apostolic but by Daniel Murray   (1768–1852), archbishop of  Dublin from 1825 until his death in 1852. Murray consecrated Griffith  to his new office on 24 August 1837, one of many new bishops in British  colonial territories that he helped to establish at the urging of Rome.
 Murray’s surviving correspondence reveals that he was the first Irish  bishop to cultivate a Roman vision for the Catholic Church throughout  the British empire. Working closely with Paul Cullen  , who from 1830  to 1850 was rector of the Irish College   in Rome and agent for Irish and  colonial bishops, Murray’s policy was to promote able men (includ- ing his own great-nephew) to the colonial episcopate. Like Cullen, he  favoured those who had been educated at the Irish College in Rome  over those who lacked experience outside Ireland.
 Like the majority of the Irish founder bishops of Catholic colonial  churches, Griffith resorted to almost any means to fund and staff his  diocese with clergy, from Ireland if possible, but from anywhere if nec- essary. He wrote repeatedly to All Hallows’ Missionary College   seeking  priests, but his appeals were not answered, possibly because he did not  accompany them with the necessary funds to pay for tuition or pas- sage.  34   He was more successful in his requests to the Association for the  Propagation of the Faith  , which published his correspondence in the   Annals  and sent funds that he used to open at least one school. While  Griffith slowly found his way, similar ventures in Catholic institution  building, funded from Lyons and staffed from Ireland, were opened up  throughout the British colonies.

 The Catholic Church in Ireland was remarkably swift to build up its  capacity to supply priests for British colonial missions. In the decade  following the lifting of the Irish penal laws (1782), diocesan seminar- ies such as Carlow College  , founded in 1782 by James Keefe, bishop  of Kildare and Leighlin, provided an education for priests of modest  means and local connections. However, it was soon able to supply the  needs of dioceses overseas. Between 1793 and 1993, Carlow trained over  300 priests for the Australian mission fields, including Fr John Joseph  Therry (1790–1864), the first Catholic chaplain, and four Australian  bishops.  41   In 1865, James Walshe, bishop of Kildare, stated that he had  thirty-three seminarians studying for ‘foreign’ (i.e. non-Irish) missions,  and that in the previous three years he had sent out sixteen missionary  priests and deacons for dioceses including England (one), Scotland (one),  the United States (six), Canada   (one), Australia   (two) and New Zealand    (one).  42   Another diocesan seminary, St Peter’s College, Wexford  , was  critical for the formation of the Catholic Church in the Cape Colony  .  Three of its early bishops and half a dozen pioneer clergy trained there  for the priesthood.  43   St Patrick’s College, Maynooth  , founded as the  National Seminary for Ireland, followed Carlow   in 1795.

 Irish Rising (1798), and the Act of Union   (1800), which saw the transfer  of the Irish parliament to Westminster. However, for the colonies the  most important foundation was the Missionary College of All Hallows,  Drumcondra  , discussed more fully in  Chapter 10 . To a certain extent,  every seminary and religious training house in Ireland was a provider of  clergy for the colonies. Once bishops were in place, they began calling  for new personnel, especially male and female teachers from the Irish  religious orders, including the Sisters of Mercy  , the Dominican Sisters  of Cabra  , Christian Brothers  , Marist Brothers   and many others. The  flow of clerical personnel from Ireland to the empire was to continue  undiminished for over 100 years.
 Association for the Propagation of the Faith (1822) Until the nineteenth century, Catholic missions were a three-fold oper- ation, with responsibility for setting up new dioceses and appointing  missionary bishops under the control of Propaganda   in Rome, training  and despatch of missionaries conducted by specialist missionary orders  and seminaries, and missions backed by royal patronage in the major  Catholic imperial powers. Missions and colonial churches had declined  with the fading imperial fortunes of Spain and Portugal and the revo- lutionary implosion of France. The rise of Napoleon   was an even more  profound setback for the imperial aspirations of the Catholic Church  with the Vatican battling for its survival and nearly losing control of  its foreign office, the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith.  The great missionary orders, including the Jesuits and the Foreign  Missionary Society of Paris, were not restored until 1814. Nevertheless,  with the emperor’s downfall, the Vatican busied itself with planning  and implementing a massive global expansion that, for the first time  in centuries, would be financially independent of the old regimes in  Europe.  44
 The revival of the capacity of the Catholic Church to fund foreign  missionary work was achieved largely through the Association for the  Propagation of the Faith   (APF), which was founded in 1822 in Lyons,  the heart of Catholic France, by a laywoman, Pauline-Marie Jaricot    (1799–1862). From Lyons it spread throughout Europe and the new  world.  45   In 1840, pope Gregory XVI   elevated the Association to that of 44     For Catholic expansion in the nineteenth century, see R.

 a universal Catholic organisation, which helped extend its authority out- side France. At the same time, he imposed tight controls on those who  damaged the ‘general and Catholic’ Association for the Propagation  of the Faith by undertaking collection tours in Europe for the benefit  of their own dioceses.  46   The Association was not under the control of  the papacy or the French bishops. Instead, on the model of Protestant  voluntary missionary societies, such as the LMS, it was a lay-led char- ity that publicised the missionary cause, collected funds and then dis- tributed them according to need. Generally, it negotiated a tightrope  between the competing interests of the national Catholic churches by  extolling the international missionary cause which properly recognised  no boundaries. With papal ‘encouragement’, the real authority of the  Association came from its endorsement and promotion by local bishops  who were pressured by the Vatican to do the same.
 Securing episcopal support for the Association   in Ireland, where sup- port for papal policy was generally unquestioned, was easy. It proved  more challenging to persuade the English vicars apostolic to do their  duty and give up control of mission fund-raising to what they perceived  as a French rival. The interval between Catholic emancipation (1829)  and the re-erection of the English hierarchy by the papacy was a diffi- cult one for the Catholic Church in England. From at least 1837, the  English vicars apostolic had been subjected to pressure from the Holy  See and Propaganda for greater missionary efforts both in England  and in British colonies, to which they were unable to respond effect- ively. In 1838, in an interview with Thomas Walsh  , vicar apostolic of  Midland District (1826–47) and Nicholas Wiseman  , vice rector of the  English College (1828–40), Pope Gregory XVI   expressed the view that  he did not wish to see the restoration of the English hierarchy because  of the risk of the government interfering in episcopal appointments, as  had previously been attempted in Ireland.  47   However, in every other  respect, he was keen to see the English church expand and take up its  missionary responsibilities. The same year, when it was proposed to  increase the number of districts in the English mission, Propaganda  responded by issuing  Statuta Proposita  (Proposed Statutes), drawn up  under the supervision of Monsignor (later Cardinal) Charles Acton   in  Rome, with detailed provisions for regulating English colonial missions 46     See the objections of the President of the Council of the Association for the  Propagation of the Faith to the collections undertaken for the Detroit Mission, cited  by R. F. Trisco,  The Holy See and the Nascent Church in the Middle Western United  States, 1826–1850  (Rome, 1962), p. 352.
 overseas.  48   These included the establishment of the French Association  for the Propagation of the Faith in England and Scotland, which had  already occurred in Ireland. Secondly, they called for the foundation of  a special missionary college exclusively for the colonies on the model  of the foreign missionary seminary in Paris, the only question being  whether it should be situated in England or in Ireland. Thirdly, they  called for the creation of an Agent General for the Colonies in London,  who would be given special responsibility for colonial business, and  who would make it easier for communication to pass between the Holy  See and British governors.
 In response to all three of these proposals from Rome, the English  vicars apostolic reacted with horror.  49   As one they replied that Catholics  in the three realms of Britain lacked the means to provide for either a  seminary for the colonies or to support a London Agent as requested.  They were also unenthusiastic about admitting the Association for the  Propagation of the Faith into their districts but would set up a commit- tee of laymen to consider it. Rome was unimpressed, and it is noticeable  that it was at this point that Propaganda turned resolutely to Dublin,  which was already heavily engaged in colonial missions in the Cape and  India, rather than to London for leadership in relation to the Catholic  missionary effort in British imperial territories. As for the Association  for the Propagation of the Faith, in May 1849 Thomas Griffiths, vicar  apostolic of London District from 1833 to 1836, directed his brother  bishops to step into line and establish regular collections for the French  society.  50   In due course, funds began to flow from the Association to  support Catholic missions in British colonies and they helped underpin  the expansion of the Catholic Church in the British empire.
 Under the title  Annals of the Propagation of the Faith  ( Annals )   an  English translation of the Association’s journal began in 1840.  51    Annals   was the first modern Catholic missionary journal, and it set the model 48     ‘Statuta Proposita’, Appendix E, in  ibid ., pp. 244–51. The attribution to Acton is  made by Ward. However, it seems just as likely that it was the result of consultation  with Paul Cullen.

 for the hundreds which succeeded it.  52   It provided a semi-official voice  not just for the activities of the Association, but also for Propaganda  and the missionary expansion of the Catholic Church in both the old  and new worlds. The first English issue carried an encyclical letter from  Pope Gregory XVI, in both Latin and English, which expressed his  joy at the progress of the faith ‘in America, the Indies and especially  in other infidel countries’ ( in America, in Indiis, atque in aliis Infi delium  praesertim terris ).  53   Missions to ‘America’ included those in Canada, the  United States and the British West Indies  . From Oceania, there were  also positive reports from New Zealand  . As far as the pope was con- cerned, this suggests, progress in advancing the Catholic faith in the  Protestant empires of the new world was only marginally less delight- ful than the conversion of Muslims and Buddhists in Asia. To advance  either cause, those who took out a subscription and maintained daily  prayers for the missions secured both a copy of the journal and also a  range of plenary or partial indulgences, depending on the size of the  donation.  54
 The reports of Catholic missions promoted in the  Annals  reflect the  same range of themes, trials and adventures as those found in Protestant  missionary journals. The model for both were the  Lettres édifi antes et  curieuses ,  écrites des missions étrangères  (‘Edifying and entertaining letters  from the foreign missions’), which published reports by Jesuit mission- aries   in what had formerly been New France  .  55   The  Annals  continued  the practice of publishing letters from missionaries, which were mainly  translations of those sent to the directors of the Propaganda College   in  Rome, or seminaries and other religious institutions that trained mis- sionaries in France, Quebec and elsewhere. These were interspersed  with appeals for missionary donations, which often compared Catholic  efforts unfavourably with those achieved by Protestants in the same  territories. Besides letters from bishops and missionaries, there were 52     By 1918, a German Jesuit estimated that there were over 400 Catholic missionary  magazines apart from formal reports and reference works.

In Catholic theology, an indul- gence was a formal remission of the strict penances earlier required for admission  of sin, which was generally assumed to extend to the punishment which otherwise  awaited the sinner in the next life.
 notices tracking the departure of missionaries to mission fields, and  each year in May, ‘Mary’s month’, there were financial summaries of  funds raised by dioceses around the world. While the various missionary  orders later acquired their own journals and fund-raising programmes,  sales of the  Annals  and donations to the Association were one of the  main fund-raising vehicles for Catholic missions and made an import- ant contribution to the ongoing expansion of the Catholic Church in  British territories. In 1840, total receipts by the Association amounted  to 2,500,000 francs (£100,000) of which France contributed 54.8 per  cent (£54,800).  56   In the British Isles, receipts were always a fraction of  those for France and Italy, but Ireland led the way. Over the next twenty  years, Irish donations declined in line with her loss of population while  receipts from the British colonies rose. However, as  Table 4.1  indicates,  there was no steady progression and total collections would always suf- fer by comparison with those for missions in Protestant countries.
 Religious rivalry   was an important motivating factor for all fund- raising and missionary efforts. This increased with the publication of  an English edition of the  Annals , which was picked up by the Protestant  missionary publications who compared Catholic efforts unfavourably  with their own. The directors of the Association for the Propagation  of the Faith were no less anxious to improve their efforts. They aspired  to a day when the  Annals  was purchased by 100 million of the faith- ful throughout the civilised world who together would generate an  income of £550,000 per annum for Catholic missions.  57   Nevertheless,  they complained, although there were three times as many Catholics  as Protestants, this would still fall short of the £1,500,000 allegedly  squandered by Protestant sects on various enterprises: This sum, however enormous, is not too much, when we recollect the extrava- gant salaries allowed the lordly missionaries of the Anglican Church in the  East and West Indies, the immense sums swallowed up by the Methodist pro- consuls, who rule it over the kings of the southern ocean, and the innumerable  hawkers of the Bibles, whose prudent zeal extends no further than to introduce  along the coasts of China, with smuggled opium, the sacred writings which  they profane.  58
 an equivalent share of the GDP of the UK it represents a staggering  £1.45 billion in today’s economy.  59   In response to Catholic slurs, the  (Protestant)  Missionary Register  derided the ‘eloquent but delusive  and embittered statements’, which were the mainstay of the  Annals ,  while the  American Theological Review  sniffed that Catholic countries  were hopelessly outclassed by Protestants as donors to the missionary  cause.  60   Needless to say – given the competition – pious poverty was  highly esteemed at all levels of the Catholic mission effort. The  Annals   commended the efforts of plucky Ireland to send out missionaries to  British colonies, which were extolled as the bold resumption of the work  of her medieval saints: [W]ith what lively emotion have we received the contributions sent us from  Ireland? Poor and venerable Church! she continues with us that mission which  she never ceased to exercise from the time she sent St Gall and St Columban  to preach the Gospel to barbarous Europe up to the present day, that she gives  bishops and priests to the frozen regions of Newfoundland  , and the savage  shores of Australia  .  61
 This acknowledged that Ireland may have been locked in the grip of  the Great Famine   (1845–52), but suggested that through mission work Table 4.1     British and world receipts (French francs) to the Society for the  Propagation of the Faith, 1840, 1854–1860

 The  Annals  catered to two audiences with this material. First, bish- ops and clergy might find the thrilling individual narratives useful both  for their personal edification and to help preach the mission cause to  their congregations. Secondly, lay Catholics, including people of very  small means in Ireland, who could purchase copies of the  Annals  for  sixpence an issue knowing that the profits benefited the foreign mis- sions (as well as obtaining the papal indulgence). Initially, the English   Annals  was devoted exclusively to accounts of missions to the heathen  by European missionary orders, which included the Jesuits in China,  Korea and America, the Picpus Fathers in eastern Oceania, and the  Marist Fathers in New Caledonia, Tonga and Samoa. From the 1840s,  a new perspective was added when the first accounts of the arrival  of English and Irish missionaries in British colonies in Australia  , the  Pacific and British North America   began to appear. Until the establish- ment of the (English) Mill Hill Fathers, it is important to note that the  ‘missions’ conducted by Catholics living in Britain and Ireland were  almost entirely directed at Irish settlers in America and the British  empire. Except through reading the  Annals  and making   donations,  Irish Catholics did not participate in the foreign missionary movement  until the twentieth century.  62
 Twenty-five years later, in 1874, the same mixture of contents, excit- ing tales from the field, calls for donations, and satisfying triumphs over  Protestants, was still forming the bulk of the contents of the  Annals .  Sectarian   tension was high in Newfoundland  , which was a  crucible  for rival Protestant and Catholic settlers with a lamentable record  of  political tension fuelled by religion dating from the middle of the   eighteenth century.  69   Thomas Sears  , prefect apostolic of St George’s  Bay (1871–85) on the western French-speaking coast of the island,  described his efforts to build a colonial mission among Catholics   of  French and Irish   descent in a context of strong sectarian rivalry.  70   Irish  Franciscan bishops, notably the controversial Michael Antony Fleming,    bishop of St John’s (fl. 1830–50), had been actively transforming the  better settled eastern diocese along Irish ultramontane   lines. However,  in St George’s, there were few resident Catholic clergy, and many fish- ermen relied on French priests travelling with the fleets to hear mass.  According to Sears, there was a pressing need for more clergy: ‘How  often have I heard these poor people speak movingly of their moral  isolation, of the hardships they had to undergo to procure religious  assistance!’  71   Accounts of religious bigotry were recounted by Sears  with surprising relish. A certain Father Hearn once came, exhausted,  to the English village of Sandy Point; he knocked at the door only to be  confronted by the angry Protestant owner: At the sight of a Catholic Missioner, the wretched man, in place of being moved  by compassion, burst out into a rage, loaded the pious traveller with curses,  shut the door, and set his dogs at him – ‘Unfortunate man!’, said the Missioner,  going off, ‘you will be punished for your cruelty, and there will be more dogs 68     ‘Departure of Missionaries’,  Annals , 9 (1848), pp. 65–9.     69     J.

 There were also new missions to su  pport in struggling British settle- ments such as Western Australia  . Martin Griver  , bishop of Perth  (1873–86), wrote a pastoral letter pleading for donations to be made to  the Association for the Propagation of the Faith to support ‘our poor  Mission’.  73   There was already a mission to the Aborigines  , conducted by  Spanish Benedictines   under the inspiration of the remarkable Rosendo  Salvado   (1814–1900),  74   and Griver’s call for alms was to assist poor  Catholic settlers. By giving, his parishioners were invited to share in the  wider Catholic world beyond their colony: ‘The trifling alms you bestow  on the Propagation of the Faith will entitle you to share in its many spir- itual graces; you will thereby become auxiliary missioners, participating  in the labours, the fruits, and the merits of all the Missioners through- out the world.’  75   The international formula for appealing for donations  remained largely unchanged into the next century.
 By the 1860s, the Oeuvre (as the APF was generally known in France)  had become something of a victim of its own success and struggled to  retain a monopoly over fund-raising for missions in the Catholic world.  The diocese of Quebec, with its long history of mission work among  native Americans and colonists in the North-West, as well as foreign mis- sions in China, was one of the first to establish independence. With the  permission of pope Gregory XVI  , the diocese of Quebec had supported  a branch of the Oeuvre since 1836.  76   In 1876, however, the president  general of the Oeuvre advised the archbishop of Quebec that the central  council in France wished to resume control of donations raised in the  province. The archdiocese refused to cooperate, and from 1877 issued  its own journal, the  Annales de la propagation de la foi pour la province de  Quebec , which reported on its missions at home and abroad without fur- ther reference to Lyons. The strategy for fund-raising in other English- speaking territories also changed. In the 1880s, the  Annals  was issued  in an improved, monthly format, with striking illustrations on almost 72      Ibid ., p. 180.     73     ‘Pastoral Letter of the Bishop of Perth’,  Annals , 9 (1874), pp. 240–6.     74     E.

 every page. Instead of the old staples of missionary letters and pleas from  bishops for funds, articles were selected to represent the picturesque and  exotic people and settings of Catholic mission work around the world.  There was a decisive shift away from Catholic missions in Protestant  settler countries, to focus exclusively on foreign missions. In the revised  format, Australia  , Canada, New Zealand   and southern Africa are men- tioned, if at all, only in relation to missions to their native inhabitants.  Mirroring the same pressures that caused a shift in the mission priorities  of the SPG, the Society now demanded that wealthy Catholics in set- tler regions, including America, Canada and Australia, should improve  their record of donations to those in greater need. In the English  Annals ,  Catholics were shamed by comparison with the open-handedness of  Germans: ‘Imagine that with all our English-speaking readers in the  United Kingdom, North America, India and Australia, we barely attain  to as many sixpences as the German Catholics do pounds.’  77   Without  the same ideological stress as that which divided the SPG and the  Evangelical missionary societies over ‘colonial’ and ‘foreign’ missions,  the Association reached the same practical outcome, which was the  expansion of foreign missions at the expense of those to Europeans in  either the old or new worlds.
 Dublin and the colonies While the Association for the Propagation of the Faith publicised and  funded missions, it did not despatch missionaries or decide on the shape  of new dioceses. This was the responsibility of Propaganda.   In the case  of English-speaking territories, many of the day-to-day decisions came  to be coordinated through the office of the archbishop of Dublin and  the rector of the two Roman seminaries that trained priests for post- ings in Britain and her colonies, the Irish College and the Propaganda  College.   This is the empire within an empire ( imperium in imperio ),  which Barr   connects with the rise of bishop Cullen.  78   Nevertheless, the  engagement of Dublin in the extension of the Catholic spiritual did not  begin with Cullen.
 It is difficult to get a full picture of the contacts between Dublin and  the colonies because of the ravages of time, politics and poverty on the  archives. So long as the Irish bishops were living more or less on the  run, they did not accumulate records that would allow us to trace their  contacts with Irish clergy overseas; the Dublin Diocesan Archives hold 77      Illustrated Catholic Missions , No. 36 (April 1889), p. 183.     78     Barr, ‘“Imperium in Imperio”’.
 only 150 items relating to the twelve archbishops from 1600 to 1770.  79    While the papers of Daniel Murray, the first bishop to be restored to the  see of Dublin, are much fuller, the habit of record-keeping was not fully  established in his reign and some of what remained was harvested by  Patrick Frances Moran for his never-completed biography of his uncle,  Paul Cullen.  80   Despite these depredations, enough remains to provide  a picture of the growing interest of the Irish hierarchy in the needs  and opportunities provided by the British colonial expansion. At the  highest level, Murray and Cullen, his successor, sought to control the  appointment of higher clergy in British settler colonies by using their  influence with Propaganda in Rome. While certain dioceses were able  to circumvent the wishes of Dublin, their victory was more or less com- plete in Australia   and New Zealand.   At the lower levels, the supply of  both parochial and regular clergy for parishes and schools respectively  were not so easy to control, if only because of the heroic scale of the  emigration of priests, and religious sisters and brothers to be teachers  and nurses in the colonies.  81   The Irish diaspora was initially served by  priests trained on the continent; later, the Irish seminaries would take  over. The single largest institution which trained priests for the Irish  colonial mission was the College of All Hallows   in Drumcondra near  Dublin, which will be discussed in  Chapter 10 . The religious orders  were also extremely important to the creation of a Catholic institutional  infrastructure in the British colonies. Scores of male and female insti- tutions were involved and while Irish orders were numerically import- ant, they came from throughout Catholic Europe.  82
 As the new missionary dioceses expanded, it is clear that neither the  papacy nor European bishops such as Murray had the capacity to con- trol clergy in distant colonies. In his detailed analysis of the relationship  of the Australian church to Propaganda, Dowd is able to demonstrate  how ineffectual was the Roman bureaucracy when dealing with recalci- trant prelates at the far reaches of the earth, when they decided to follow  a particular line of action.  85   Only as time went on were bishops able to  assert their authority and control the most problematic of their clergy.  In Europe, a number of unscrupulous priests – how many we will never  know – were also able to take advantage of the gullible Catholic pub- lic on the pretext of supporting the mission cause. As correspondence  in the Dublin Diocesan Archives shows, John Coyle   was one of them.  From among his own parishioners, ‘the poor and generous people of  Bermondsey and Wapping’, Coyle managed to raise funds which he  immediately used to make his way to Rome, ostensibly to obtain a mis- sionary appointment from Propaganda. In Rome, he met up with John  Brady  , the new bishop of Perth (1845–71), who offered him a position  in Western Australia   if he could obtain a free passage on a convict ship  as a chaplain. When Lord Grey in the Colonial Office refused this  request, Coyle resorted to printing the facts of his case complaining  about his treatment by the secular and ecclesiastical authorities who  thwarted his hopes for emigration. Indomitable, he later ended up in  South Australia.
 There must have been many clergy labouring under the same opti- mistic delusion that a colonial chaplaincy   or missionary posting would  be the solution to all their personal and career problems. Ignoring  the poverty, monotony and challenge of frontier conditions in colo- nial parishes, they longed to escape from lapses of sobriety, chastity, 83     Fr Patrick Moran SJ to Murray, 22 February 1829, Dublin Diocesan Archives,  Murray Papers, File 33/13, no. 2.
 In the last year of his life, therefore, Murray was thinking like the epis- copal general he had become, dividing his empire, like Napoleon, into  new provinces. Possibly, the note was intended for discussion with  Propaganda since the division of dioceses was strictly beyond his pow- ers, though not his imagination. He noted that New South Wales, with a  Catholic population of 135,000, had four bishops, whereas Victoria had  a Catholic population of about 140,000, ‘in even better circumstances’,  and yet had only one bishop. Victoria, he mused, had three towns lar- ger than any in New South Wales, Ballarat, Geelong and Sandhurst: ‘A  parallel of Longitude from the Lachlan River to the point at which the  Tarcutta Creek enters the Murray River, that creek and the mountains  from which it comes might separate Goulburn from Albury.’  92   This was  where the new dioceses were created.
 After Murray, the architect of the colonial ascendancy of the Irish  Catholic Church was his successor, the uncrowned pope of Greater  Britain  , Paul Cullen (1803–78), rector first of the Irish College in Rome  from 1832 to 1850, then briefly pro-rector of Urban College, the mis- sionary seminary of Propaganda in Rome.  93   Cullen was made bishop of  Armagh in 1849, transferred to the see of Dublin in 1852, and elevated  to the cardinalate in 1866. He was Ireland’s first cardinal, convened  the country’s national synod, secured the creation of a Catholic univer- sity for Ireland, and has been credited with a commanding influence,  through his control of the Irish bishops and the many Irish appoint- ments to colonial sees in Australia  , New Zealand  , British Guyana and  South America. His influence was rather less in British North America,  New Zealand and southern Africa if only because, as a proportion of  the total population, Irish emigrants were nowhere as significant as  they were in Australia. In the United States and British North America,  as in Scotland, there was more success in resisting the Cullenisation of  the episcopate that occurred in the southern settler colonies.  94   Cullen  was a methodical administrator whose mastery of detail and unswerv- ing devotion to Rome was expressed through his control of episco- pal appointments in British colonies. However, he was secretive and  seems to have had no personal life, keeping a chilly distance from all  his biographers, including his own nephew. Looking for some key to his 92      Ibid .

 The gradual increase in importance of Australia   can be measured  in the Cullen correspondence, which begins in Rome and continues  in an unbroken stream until his death. In Dublin, Cullen maintained  what he had started at the Irish College in Rome, where he served as  the agent for the Irish and Irish-Australian hierarchy in its dealings  with Propaganda, writing to former students and missionary clergy  and securing appointments which he adapted to his opinion of their  capacity and loyalty to Rome. As archbishop of Dublin, his incoming  letters were divided into three classes: those to Irish bishops, those to  bishops outside Ireland, and those to the Holy See. In 1849, while he  was still bishop of Armagh, Cullen received letters from the bishops  of Halifax, Trinidad, the apostolic nuncio in Paris (five), the apos- tolic nuncio in Madrid, Philadelphia, cardinal Wiseman in London,  York (two), Natchez (United States) and just one from Australia, from  Patrick Boniface Geoghegan, the Irish Franciscan vicar general of the  bishop of Melbourne, later bishop of Adelaide (1859–64). By 1866,  the year he became a cardinal, Cullen was receiving dozens of letters  concerning ecclesiastical appointments from bishops overseas while  corresponding with Alessandro Barnabò, the prefect of Propaganda, at  least two or three times a week. Dowd has argued that Cullen’s intim- acy with Barnabò and his lack of rapport with archbishop Polding of  Sydney were the main reasons Polding’s ambitions for the creation of a  Benedictine province in Australia were so effectively subverted.  98
 them that it was appropriate to regard the dioceses of British settler   colonies as effective dependencies of Dublin.
 Cullen was a practical administrator. He sought to secure Irish con- trol of Catholics in the British empire as a natural reflection of Ireland’s  position as the pre-eminent Catholic country in the British Isles. His  influence in Australia   is readily apparent by noting the expansion of  Irish appointments in the  Catholic Registry . First published in 1851,  this periodical provided a list of Catholic clergy in English. It covered  Rome, Ireland, England, Scotland, America and the Colonies – the last  appearing for the first time in 1853. It also printed Catholic news and  statistics, such as a list of Catholic converts, observations from the cen- sus demonstrating ‘the decimation of unfortunate Ireland’, and other  historical annals. In 1853, the  Catholic Registry    described the ‘Oceanican  Register’ as the fifth great division of the globe with the archdiocese of  Sydney at its heart. The nationalities of its bishops and leading clerics  were carefully delineated. John Bede Polding  , ‘native of England’, was  archbishop of Sydney. Other English natives held the sees of Hobart  (Willson  ) and Maitland (Vaughan  ). A Spanish Benedictine, Rosendo  Salvado  , held Victoria (North Australia), and, with the forced retire- ment of John Brady   in Western Australia, there were just two Irish bish- ops, Francis Murphy   in Adelaide and the Augustinian, James Alipius  Goold   in Melbourne.  99   Nevertheless, in less than ten years, the much  expanded Australian Register was dominated almost entirely by Irish  appointments, many of them graduates of the Irish College   in Rome  where Cullen had served as rector. This gradual advance in the Irish  episcopate was only part of the story, however, because, once a Cullenite  bishop was in place, he then had the power to secure additional appoint- ments to colonial seminaries, parishes, schools, hospitals and convents  from among his own contacts. In this way, a single Irish bishop was  likely to create a chain of additional appointments from Ireland that  tended to accentuate and entrench the Irish character of the see.  100   The  effect of this was to last well into the next century.
 to popular revolt that came within his aegis. He was repelled by excessive  displays of Irish nationalism  . In 1865, for example, Cullen wrote with  concern about the scandalous behaviour of some alumni of All Hallows  College,   particularly on the matter of an overly close identification with  their native country and its political problems.  101   In 1872, Cullen consid- ered shutting it down.  102   Nevertheless, there would seem little doubt from  his pattern of appointments and range of interests that Cullen wished to  make Ireland and its Catholic Church central to the imperial expansion  of Catholicism. Because of resistance to their policies in Ireland, Cullen  was anxious to secure a power base for his own ultramontane Irish  Catholic party among the English-speaking bishops overseas. However,  even in the British empire, Cullen’s season of influence was limited to the  period of very rapid expansion of the colonial episcopate. Once the colo- nial churches secured their own metropolitan, Cullen’s capacity to con- tinue influencing the internal affairs of the national churches declined.  When Patrick Francis Moran  , Cullen’s nephew, became archbishop of  Sydney, the flow of correspondence from Australia   to Dublin suddenly  dried up. The one exception to this rule was the continuing significance,  at the highest level of ecclesiastical appointment, of the Irish College in  Rome where Tobias Kirby succeeded Cullen as rector in 1870, effectively  extending his influence into the next generation.
 The ultimate prize for Cullen’s loyalty to Rome and control of the  Irish episcopate in the British colonies was influence in the College of  Cardinals (the body of leading clerics in the Catholic Church who elect  the pope), and in church councils. In 1864, pope Pius IX   announced  the calling of the Vatican Council  , the first ecumenical council of the  Church to be held in 300 years. It opened in Rome in December 1869  and adjourned prematurely, but permanently, on 20 October 1870. The  actual achievements of the Council, which ran from December 1869  to October 1870, were limited by the threatened invasion of the Papal  States by the troops of the Risorgimento, the movement for Italian  unification. However, in a climate of political crisis, they included the  definition of ‘papal infallibility’   on questions of faith and morals, the  culmination of an increasingly papal-centred and supernatural form  of Catholicism which was especially challenging to both traditional  Protestants and Gallican Catholics.  103   According to the journal of the 101     Cullen Papers, DDA, Holy See, 1858–60, Letter no. 107.     102     Moran to Murray, 21 July 1872, Maitland Diocesan Archives, cited by A.

 English Benedictine William Ullathorne  ,  104   which is our major source  of information about the inner workings of the Council, Cullen himself  was responsible for the wording of the definition of papal infallibility.  It was this formulation which managed to overcome the objections of  many of the bishops at the Council who suspected it would give unprece- dented power to the papacy and increase sectarian   tensions throughout  Europe. Cullen’s major ally at the Council was Henry Manning  , arch- bishop of Westminster (1865–92) and leader of the Catholic Church  in England. Both Cullen and Manning, who came from outside the  main group of European bishops in majority Catholic states, gave their  unswerving support to the advance of papal power at the expense of  national and imperial churches. In Cullen’s case, his influence was  strengthened psychologically by the Irish colonial bishops whose loy- alty was also securely fastened on Rome, as meditated through Cullen,  that Roman of the Romanists.  105   In this way, Cullen, and the colonial  British bishops he appointed, helped reshape and reform the Catholic  Church as a worldwide movement, breaking the dominance wielded by  the Catholic states of the ancien regime.
 In this chapter, we have seen that Irish ambitions for empire were cre- ated out of opportunities presented to them because of the emigration  of Irish Catholics to British colonies and service in the armed forces. In  contrast to the SPG, these prospects for the expansion of the Catholic  Church were not articulated using the rhetoric of British imperialism,  but that of the resurgent papal power under Pius IX   in Rome, ably sup- ported by Paul Cullen in Dublin. At their most ambitious, Irish bish- ops could be utterly ruthless in seeking to entrench their control over  new mission territories. However, their power was neither absolute nor  was it uncontested. Initially, it was English Benedictines   who pioneered  the expansion of the Catholic Church in the southern British colonies,  and Scottish bishops in the Maritimes. At all times, European reli- gious orders were significant providers of missionary clergy, especially  in colonies such as Canada, Mauritius and Madagascar where France  rather than Ireland provided leadership for the Church. Catholic power  was also contested within the empire by the many rival Protestant  churches of the British Isles which were striving, in the same period, 104     Cited by Norman Tanner, ‘Paul Cullen and the Declaration of the Papal Infallibility’,  unpublished conference paper, Paul Cullen and His World Conference, Pontificio  Collegio Irlandese, Rome, 23–25 October 2009.

 to establish themselves. Overall, however, there was a symbiotic rela- tionship between the British imperial need for personnel and the cap- acity of Ireland to export her people and cultural institutions, notably  the Catholic Church, to the colonies. Catholic poverty and disability  in the British Isles in the eighteenth century was the dramatic back- drop to the imperial expansion of Catholics in the nineteenth century.  Catholic expansion was the hallmark of the nineteenth. However, all the  churches, and their sects and church parties, found opportunities on the  imperial stage. The next chapter considers the part played by Anglican  Evangelicals in the Church of England beyond Great Britain.
 This chapter provides an account of the imperial work and ambi- tions of the CCCS, a colonial missionary society created to advance  the cause of Christianity by ensuring as many Anglican Evangelical  teachers and clergy as possible were able to find their way out to serve  in colonial dioceses.  2   The colonial missionary ethos of the CCCS, 1     Colonial and Continental Church Society,  Missions in Many Lands: The Work of the  Colonial and Continental Church Society  (London, 1896).
 2     The CCCS   has had many changes of name. According to the Intercontinental Church  Society website,  www.ics-uk.org/about/familytree.shtml , the Society was created in  1851 by the amalgamation of (1) the Newfoundland Society for the Education of  the Poor (founded 1823), later called the Newfoundland and British North America  Society for Educating the Poor (1829) and the Church of England Society of the Poor  of Newfoundland and the Colonies (1846) and (2) the Western Australia Missionary  Society (founded 1835), later called the Australian Church Missionary Society (1836) like their poor missionary haunted by the deaths in his family in the  backblocks of Canada, was frugal, pious and earnest. Perhaps, above  all, it was resilient so that by the end of the twentieth century it was  the only Society that survived with something like the old colonial  mission spirit still intact. Overall, the CCCS was more Protestant and  less overtly imperialistic than the SPG, but it was also more dogmatic,  sectarian and proselytising. The CCCS was the vanguard of evangel- icalism in the British world. Over the course of the nineteenth century,  it adapted to colonial conditions, slowly discarding its old sectarian  rhetoric and evolving to become one of the strongest supporters of  the ideal of Greater Britain   and its successor, the bush ethos  , in the  colonies.
 Evangelicalism Problems of definition have tended to dog historians of evangelical- ism in both the British and the American traditions, but the term  has three major meanings. At one level, the word ‘evangelical’ refers  to the preaching of the Christian gospel. In a number of European  languages, including German, it simply means ‘Protestant’. Secondly,  for example in the collection edited by Noll, Bebbington and Rawlyk,  ‘evangelicalism’ refers to the network of Protestant movements which  arose during the eighteenth century in the English-speaking world  and has come to form one of the largest and most influential forces in  world Christianity today.  3   Thirdly, ‘Evangelicals’ (distinguishable in  this book by the use of a capital E) refers to a group of self-consciously  serious Christians in the Church of England who originally came  together in the eighteenth century and who sought to rejuvenate the  religious foundations of their church. Bebbington suggests that, theo- logically, all evangelicals can be distinguished by commitment to the  bible, a focus on the cross as a symbol of Christ’s atonement, a convic- tion that conversion is possible and necessary for salvation, and active and Colonial Church Society (1838). The amalgamated society was first called the  Colonial Church and School Society (1851), then the Colonial and Continental  Church Society (1861), then the Commonwealth and Continental Church Society  (1958) and, since 1978, the Intercontinental Church Society (or ‘Inter’). For simpli- city, prior to 1851, the two societies will be referred to as the Newfoundland School  Society (NSS) and Colonial Church Society (CCS) respectively, and, after 1851, as  the Colonial and Continental Church Society (CCCS).

Rawlyk, eds.,  Evangelicalism: Comparative  Studies of Popular Christianity in North America, the British Isles, and Beyond, 1700–1990   (New York, 1994). Alternatively, it is possible to speak of three denominational strands  of evangelicalism: Anglican, Methodist and Nonconformist.
 enthusiasm for spreading the gospel.  4   The most positive feature of the  movement was its promotion of social and humanitarian projects such  as elementary education and the reform or abolition of commercial  and colonial institutions that were exploitative or immoral, notably  the Atlantic slave trade. Less attractively, Evangelicals could be pater- nalistic, prudish and judgmental, and the conscience of its predom- inately middle-class adherents was much more alert to working-class  vices such as gambling, sexual immorality, alcohol consumption and  Sabbath-breaking than to political and social inequality. As their num- bers grew in the course of the nineteenth century, Evangelicals and  their Nonconformists allies came to exude a cheerful Protestantism  in which anti-Catholicism and the defence of religious liberty were  accepted as twin faces of the one cause.  5   Like other Victorians, they  were also empire-minded.
 Beginning in the 1820s, Evangelicals in the United Church of England  and Ireland began to acquire something of the character of a church  within a church. Under the leadership of Charles Simeon (1759–1836),  they had already begun to buy up livings, which gave them the right to  appoint to parishes, in prominent English towns and cities. Evangelical  ordinands were supported financially by the Elland Society,   which ena- bled many poor men to enter the clerical profession either at home or,  as opportunities arose, for service as missionaries or colonial chaplains  overseas.  6   In time, there were Evangelical bishops appointed to sees at  home whose patronage in turn ensured that more Evangelical bishops  were sent to the colonies.  7   There were Evangelicals who gave leader- ship in both Houses of Parliament and others in the bureaucracy, most 4     D.

Bebbington summarises these characteristics by the  words: ‘biblicism’, ‘crucicentrism’, ‘conversionism’ and ‘activism’.
 notably the Colonial Office. This cohesive and comprehensive imperial  network created a secure funding base for Evangelical causes which  were advanced by the innumerable Evangelical societies, many con- trolled by laymen and some women.  8
 The largest of these should be ranked among the most influen- tial organisations in Victorian society: they had branches all over the  country and auxiliaries in the colonies, their membership numbered  in the thousands, they were patronised by royalty and they drew large  audiences to regular meetings in their central meeting house at Exeter  Hall   in the Strand. Bradley, who monitors the meetings of Evangelical  societies   from the advertisements which were placed in the  Record , the  Evangelical magazine, notes that in the course of one week in May 1829  there were fifty meetings. These ranged from breakfast rallies for local  causes to those supplying the resources of the vast international agen- cies.  9   An even longer list of societies was compiled by Ford K. Brown,  suggesting that for every conceivable religious, moral, educational and  philanthropic concern in Victorian England, there was a corresponding  society to support it. While not all of these were dominated by Anglican  Evangelicals, eight societies were foundational to the Evangelical net- work.  10   These were the Church Missionary Society   (1799), the Religious  Tract Society   (1799), the British and Foreign Bible Society   (1804), the  London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews   (1808),  the Prayer Book and Homily Society (1812), the British Newfoundland  and North America Society for Educating the Poor (1823), the General  Society for Promoting District Visiting   (1828) and the Church Pastoral  Aid Society   (1836). Of these great societies, the Newfoundland Society,  soon to be extended to include all settler colonies in the empire, became  the vehicle for galvanising support for planting Evangelical churches,  schools and ministers in the colonies.
 Evangelicals   had a striking impact on the colonial world because of  the success of foreign and colonial missionary organisations, many of  which they had helped to found, and the coherence of their vision of a  world united by Christ and led by a devoted Protestant ministry at home  and overseas. While this vision was and is fundamentally religious in  nature, its proselytising characteristics made it the natural partner of  other, expansive political and social movements. These included British  imperialism.

 Evangelicals and colonial missions Missionary organisations would eventually become central to the  self-image and success of Evangelical Anglicanism but until the early  years of the nineteenth century they lacked an organisational base for  extending their reach internationally in either the foreign or colonial  mission fields. Missions only became a serious object of the Evangelical  movement through the discussions of the Eclectic Society, whose key  members included the former slave-ship captain and hymn-writer  John Newton   (1725–1807) and the politician William Wilberforce    (1759–1833). Initially, like the SPG, the Eclectic Society   made no par- ticular distinction between missions to colonists and missions to the  heathen. In fact, the first mission considered by the Society was that to  the convict colony of Botany Bay (1786); a few years later missions to  the East Indies (1789) and Africa (1791) were also discussed. Finally,  on 18 February 1799, John Venn   outlined the principles of a society  that would conduct missions without the direct leadership of bishops. It  would concentrate on Africa and the Far East, which were fields where  no other English missionary society was active. This led to the foun- dation of the Church Missionary Society   for Africa and the Far East  (CMS), which was one of the major organisational achievements of  the evangelical revival.  11   Before its attention was entirely directed away  from the settler colonies, the CMS was responsible for the mission to  the Maori   in New Zealand  , initiated by Samuel Marsden  , as well as a  short-lived mission to Aborigines   in the interior of New South Wales.  12    From 1822, the CMS was also engaged in British North America    and reports of these colonial missions were included in the Society’s   Missionary Register . After this time, the CMS remained focused on for- eign missions to non-Christians and did not send missionaries to work  among British settlers or the aborigines   in British settlements.
 Evangelicals also came out to the colonies to work as colonial chap- lains   drawing their stipend from the government purse. Indeed, the  son of one of the first colonial chaplains in Australia  , William Cowper,    boasted that all four of the first chaplains sent to New South Wales  were Evangelicals.  13   In 1787, John Newton despatched the Reverend 11     E. Elbourne, ‘The Foundation of the Church Missionary Society: The Anglican  Missionary Impulse’, in  The Church of England c.1689–c.1833 , ed. J. Walsh (Cambridge,  1993), pp. 247–64.
 Despite such stirring sentiments, the funding of colonial mission work  was initially felt by most Evangelicals to be the responsibility of the  SPG and, as we will see in the next chapter, the occasional Wesleyan or  Nonconformist chaplain.
 Voluntary missionary societies formed by Anglican laymen had  been common in the eighteenth century, but after Parliament granted  a charter to the SPG this tended to suppress further efforts by indi- viduals. Thereafter, most churches, not just the Church of England,  committed mission work to the SPG and the SPCK.   The new evangel- ical missionary societies founded later in the nineteenth century were  controversial and different. Keen to do their bit to Christianise the  empire in their own way, a number of pious laymen, including naval  and  military officers, commercial fishermen and colonial officials,  helped to establish missionary societies which were in effect rivals to  the efforts of the SPG.
 The Newfoundland School Society   (1823) and the Western Australia  Missionary Society   (1835, known by 1838 as the Colonial Church  Society) had similar objects, summarised effectively by Underwood: ‘to  keep the white man Christian in whatever country he may settle.’  15    These two societies eventually merged to form the CCCS (now known  as the Intercontinental Church Society), as we will see below. A third  Evangelical colonial missionary society, the South American Missionary  Society   (SAMS),  16   was founded in 1843 by Allen Gardiner   (1794–1851),  a former captain in the Royal Navy, whose peripatetic evangelising over 14      Ibid ., p. 3.     15     B.

 four continents eventually led him to attempt to convert the indigenous  people of Tierra del Fuego  . This mission had a more than usually disas- trous inauguration when the first seven missionaries, including Gardiner  himself, starved to death waiting for a ship to come and resupply them.  The publication of Gardiner’s journal provided a martyr for the cause,  which helped fund-raising, and the Society was relaunched from a base  in the Falkland Islands  . Unfortunately, in November 1859, a second  missionary team was wiped out by the Yaghan Indians with the loss  of another eight lives. After this, the Society refocused on missions to  colonists. Its work came to include evangelisation of Catholics in neigh- bouring Argentina  , support for English, Welsh and Spanish-speaking  settlers, and some work among native people in South America.  17
 Eventually, the CCCS would become the best known of all the organi- sations which served the needs of settler Christians in the British empire.  Underwood has written an institutional history, originally published in  1974 and twice updated,  18   and the Society’s records, which date back to  1823, are kept in excellent and accessible order in the London Guildhall  Library. Like many societies, it also published an annual report with a  copy of its annual sermon and other periodicals including the  Greater  Britain   Messenger . It is unfortunate that some key records, including  most of the early correspondence and all records relating to candidates  applying to the Society appear to have been lost. Nevertheless, the sur- viving records of the CCCS and its predecessors provide one of the best  sources of information about the spirit that generated and sustained the  colonial missionary ideal within the broader Evangelical movement. Its  story begins with two separate societies, both founded by laymen, and  located at opposite ends of the earth.

 The founder of the Newfoundland School Society (NSS) was a suc- cessful cod merchant and trader called, appropriately enough, Samuel  Codner   (1776–1858). The first meeting was in a London coffee house  in 1823, during which Codner is said to observed: ‘Britons had a spe- cial duty to perform arising out of their extensive colonies.’ There is  no record of this speech, as Underwood notes, in the accounts of the  founding meeting.  21   However, such views mirrored the ambitions of  leading Evangelical laymen and no doubt reflected those expressed by  the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool (1812–27),   in a speech given to the  British and Foreign Bible Society   in 1822, which had been attended by  Codner.  22   The distinguishing feature of the NSS was its commitment  to the provision of evangelical teachers for a single colony rather than  a more widespread charitable, educational or missionary purpose.  23   Its  object was ‘to teach the people the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures and  the way of salvation in them’.  24   The first anniversary sermon, delivered 19     Pascoe,  Two Hundred Years of the SPG , p. 89.     20     For Catholics on Newfoundland, see Greene,  Between Damnation and Starvation ; and Chapter 4  above.     21     Underwood,  Faith at the Frontiers .

 by the Reverend Edward Cooper  , spoke of the Newfoundlanders as a  people who ‘speak our language and partake our civil and religious lib- erties’, and who were crying out for a decent education for their chil- dren.  25   For such a small-scale project, the list of those who attached  themselves to the cause is remarkable and included many of the lead- ing figures in the Evangelical movement:  26   Lord Liverpool was Patron,  and the first President was Lord Bathurst  , Secretary of State for the  Colonies (1808–28). Vice presidents included Henry Ryder  , bishop of  Lichfield, Lord Bexley, Chancellor of the Exchequer (1812–23) and  William Wilberforce  . According to Codner, it was Wilberforce who  took the initiative, secured the appropriate level of patronage, and made  the NSS a major Evangelical project. Codner was appointed Assistant  Secretary and conducted its correspondence. His committee included  Josiah Pratt   and Edward Bickersteth   (Joint Secretaries of the CMS),  Henry Budd  , Samuel Crowther   and Daniel Wilson  , vicar of Islington.  There was an active women’s auxiliary and the Laws and Regulations  of the Society specified that ‘the Schools shall be managed by Masters  and Mistresses of the United Church of England and Ireland’,  27   giving  particular prominence to the lay teachers who would be the Society’s  mainstay in the colony. By the 1830s, the NSS had secured the patron- age of Queen Victoria   (reigned 1837–1901), the pinnacle of respectabil- ity for all religious organisations.
 What was it that enabled a fish merchant – albeit one backed by  Wilberforce – to persuade the Queen, the Prime Minister and many  of London’s most distinguished and active Evangelical clergy to take  such a close interest in a colonial school society? There was certainly  a need for basic education on Newfoundland  , but the strength of sup- port given to this project may be linked to Newfoundland’s status as  a colony with a near majority Catholic population on the Protestant  frontier of Britain.  28   It was therefore the colonial equivalent of the Irish  province of Ulster, or the Highlands and Western Islands of Scotland –  regions of strongly contested religious rivalry, where it was useful to 25      Proceedings of the Society for Educating the Poor of Newfoundland: Third Year,  1825–26: Containing the Anniversary Sermon by Reverend Edward Cooper  (London,  1826), p. 19.
 28     According to the Returns of 1845, the number of Catholics and Protestants was more  or less equal, i.e. 37,376 Roman Catholics and 37,376 Protestants. See  Population,  Religion and Education  (1878),  www.oldandsold.com/articles11/newfoundland-16. shtml .
 assert Britain’s reformed Protestant credentials. It was also a region  where the SPG had failed to assert its earlier monopoly on the provision  of a ‘national’ school system to people who were British subjects. Here  was an opportunity for Evangelicals to show their effectiveness in an  imperial, missionary, cause.
 For its supporters, the NSS was an overwhelming success in meeting  an educational need. As early as 1839, Martin gave warm endorsement  to the work of the Newfoundland and British North American School  Society in his great colonial digest.  29   More recently, historians have  been more sceptical about both the benefits supplied and the motiv- ation of those active in the Society. McCann queries whether the pur- pose of the NSS was ever more than nominally missionary in character  and stresses what he interprets as the overt imperialist ideology of its  traditions.  30   He argues that NSS schools tended to teach bible reading  and little else and were narrowly focused on the promotion of an exclu- sive ideology at the expense of much of the population. In the 1820s,  the supporters of the SPG   were equally unhappy about the arrival of  teachers supplied by a rival Anglican society. NSS teachers were gen- erally fervent young Protestants and many proved to be a trial to the  colonial governors and bishops, most of whom were Tory high church- men with little sympathy for the Evangelical party in the Church of  England. In 1823, the first year of its operation, Charles Hamilton  ,  one of a succession of senior naval officers appointed as governors of  Newfoundland, protested against the financial support given to the  NSS by the Colonial Office. His own preference was to encourage the  SPG and its diocesan schools.
 Anglican bishops in North America were eventually forced to  cooperate with whoever could provide staff and funding for their work.  Others, notably John Inglis  , third bishop of Nova Scotia (1825–50),  were unwilling to compromise with what they perceived as an infringe- ment on their episcopal jurisdiction.  31   Inglis insisted on control of all  organisations within his diocese and refused to allow his clergy to attach  themselves to Evangelical societies. Even-handedly, he also opposed  extending the political rights of Roman Catholics.  32   He was strongly  opposed by members of his own clergy, including the Evangelical 29     Martin,  Statistics , pp. 263–4.     30     McCann, ‘Newfoundland School Society’.     31     This account draws on J. Fingard, ‘Inglis, John’,  Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online , vol. VII,  1836–1850  (2000); J. Fingard, ‘Uniacke, Robert Fitzgerald’,   Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online , vol. IX,  1861–1870  (2000).
 Robert Fitzgerald Uniacke   in Halifax. In New Brunswick, however,  the NSS found unanticipated support from John Medley  , bishop of  Fredericton (1845–92), as well as the lieutenant governors. Medley  was a Tractarian,   indeed the first Tractarian bishop in the Church of  England. However his outlook was not exclusive and he was prepared  to work with the NSS and its successor, the Colonial Church Society.  With this backing, the NSS was able to defy Inglis and other defend- ers of the SPG and its ‘national’ (i.e. orthodox Anglican) schools.  Nevertheless, it was not until Edward Feild   (1801–76) succeeded as the  second bishop of Newfoundland   (1844–76) that a rapprochement was  reached. Although a definite high churchman himself, Feild ordained  NSS schoolmasters as deacons and priests who subsequently played a  major role as clergy in the fledging church. Inglis, in contrast, refused  to ordain any missionaries other than those supported by the SPG or  trained by his own King’s College. Feild eventually supported proposals  to widen the Society’s franchise so that it might become ‘the principal  Colonial School Society in connection with the Established Church’.  33    This was effectively a capitulation to the Evangelical party, and recog- nition that the doughty Protestant agents of the NSS and the CCS had  beaten the SPG at its own game – that of providing schools for British  colonists.
 Colonial Church Society (1835–50) On the other side of the empire, in the remote reaches of the coast of  Western Australia  , another devout Evangelical layman was responsible  for the establishment of the Western Australian Missionary Society,  later the Colonial Church Society (CCS), which was initiated in 1825  by Captain Frederick Chidley Irwin   (1788–1860).  34   Irwin, the son of a  Church of Ireland clergyman, was a veteran of the Peninsular War who  saw colonial service in Canada, Ceylon and the Swan River Colony  in Western Australia, where he had command of the 63rd Regiment  of Foot, and occasionally served as acting governor.  35   Irwin’s original 33     Underwood,  Faith at the Frontiers , p. 27. Under Feild, the number of clergy who had  earlier been supplied by the SPG but could now be sustained independently increased  significantly.
 34     The First Report (no date but presumably 1837) calls the society the Australian  Church Missionary Society; the Second Report (1838) renames it the Colonial Church  Society and the Third Report (1839) the Colonial Church Society for Sending Out  Clergymen, Catechists, and Schoolmasters to the Colonies of Great Britain, and to  British Residents in Other Parts of the World.
 While in London, where he had been recalled to give an account of  the colony to the Colonial Office, Irwin enlisted the support of Baptist  Noel, Minister of St John’s Chapel, Bedford Row, the venue for the  Eclectics who had given birth to the CMS. They convened a meet- ing in the vestry of St John’s, which formed the Swan River Mission,  ‘having for its object the sending out of missionaries of the Church  of England, and also schoolmasters, to the Aborigines   and the colo- nists’; the Western Australian Missionary Society was founded shortly  after, on 30 September 1835. Irwin then set up a Dublin commit- tee, which included his father and some of the latter’s clerical friends,  such as the chaplains from the Molyneux Blind Asylum and the South  Penitentiary, and a number of laymen. Together, they secured a mis- sionary for Western Australia, the unfortunate Dr Louis Giustiniani  ,  who arrived in the colony in 1836, but whose controversial mixed mis- sion to Aborigines and colonists was terminated in 1838.
 It is not difficult to suspect that neither the CMS nor the SPG were  enthusiastic about what may have been perceived to be Irwin’s low- brow attempt to circumvent their jurisdiction, but we do not know the  details. However, in a hasty postscript to his published account of the  Swan River settlement, Irwin announced that ‘unforeseen difficulties’  had led to a change of plan for the mission.  37   The Dublin committee  was downgraded to a fund-raising auxiliary and the ‘parent Society’  moved to London. Within a year, and without further consultation,  the now London-based Society abandoned the idea of a mission to the  Australian Aborigines   (leaving Giustiniani to his fate), and expanded  the objectives of the society to focus on missions to settlers across the  empire. This time it carefully avoided any conflict of interest with the  CMS.  38
 In its second year in London, the annual meeting of the CCS, presided  over by Teignmouth and Captain Vernon Harcourt  , announced ambi- tious plans to extend the sphere of its work ‘to embrace all the Colonies  of Great Britain’. Admiral Hawker, John Hutt  , the recently appointed  Governor of Western Australia, and Captain Sir Edward Parry   (1790– 1855), Arctic explorer and, from 1829 to 1834, Commissioner of the  Australian Agricultural Company, passed motions. The Society had an  office in the newly opened epicentre of Evangelical business in Exeter  Hall. All seemed set for great things. The honour roll of vice presidents  is especially impressive and included a number of serving or former  colonial governors, naval officers or military men, including Sir John  Franklin   (1786–1847), Governor of Van Diemen’s Land and, subse- quently, hapless Arctic explorer, Sir Ralph Darling   (1772–1858), former  Governor of New South Wales, Sir Peregrine Maitland   (1777–1854),  formerly Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada   and former Governor  of the Cape of Good Hope, as well as Parry. The President was Charles  Middleton   (First Baron Barham), the Lord of the Admiralty, a friend  of Wilberforce and a notable figure in the anti-slavery campaign.  41   It  is difficult to judge the extent of the interest of the great and the good  in the work of the Society. Parry appears to have been the only one  of the vice presidents to have attended an annual meeting. However,  even he had other Evangelical interests and his time was not unlimited.  Nevertheless, in his letters, he is said to have frequently mentioned the 39     For the full committee, see  First Report of the Australian Church Missionary Society ,  established 23 September 1835, Australian Joint Copying Project, p. 7; Underwood,   Faith at the Frontiers , p. 29.

 As for ideology, the CCS   was robustly patriotic and pro-colonial from  its earliest days, which may be a reflection of the admirals and cap- tains and military officers who were among its most important patrons.  The tone was set in the opening sentence of the first CCS report: ‘It  is the glory of Great Britain, that by sending out her colonies to many  lands, she extends through the earth the knowledge of her language,  her manners, her laws, and her religion.’  43   But bringing Christianity  to British settlers was not just a patriotic duty that appealed to pious  elements in the navy, military and colonial service. It also made it pos- sible for the CCS to secure investment in its particular work in the  face of stiff competition from other missionary societies. The case for  colonists is argued throughout the society’s publications, which origin- ally consisted of an annual report and ‘Occasional Papers’. These stress  the need for a particular Evangelical mission to colonists, pointing out  the moral as well as the physical perils of the frontier, the Providential  obligation placed on Englishmen to support colonists, and the danger  of encroachment by Romanists and Tractarian   crypto-Romanists in  British territories overseas. In contrast to foreign missionary societies,  such as the LMS and CMS, for whom settlers were perceived as an  impediment to missionary progress, the CCS praised settlers, calling  them the ‘glory of Great Britain’, and giving them credit for extend- ing British power and commerce while they struggled against adversity.  Although they had left Britain’s shores, they were still connected by the  closest ties; they retained ‘English opinions, habits, and affections’, and  they deserved to be supported and remembered by their countrymen.  44    If earlier colonists had been guilty of moral lapses, particularly in rela- tion to  aboriginal people, then it was the task of the CCS to provide  missionaries who would ensure that Christianity guided their future  development.
 The CCS was one of the first organisations (other than the SPG) to  promote the cause of colonists, a group who had attracted few advo- cates in the era before Edward Gibbon Wakefield  . Strategies to con- vince the British public included the provision of statistics, charts and  tables which emphasised the scale of the work that needed to be done.  In Upper Canada  , for example, the 1838 report estimated that over the 42     E. Parry,  Memoirs of Rear-Admiral Sir W. Edward Parry  (New York, 1857), p. 179.     43     First Report [of the CCS] (1836), Australian Joint Copying Project, p. 3. This paragraph is a précis of the first editorial. The same sentiments and arguments are  repeated in later reports and occasional papers.
 With plans to extend the work empire-wide, funding was always a  critical problem and the Society followed a strategy of approaching  the government and tapping the Evangelical network for support. At a  meeting on 8 January 1839, the Secretary reported on his approach to  Sir George Grey   (1799–1882), who was then Under Secretary of State  for War and the Colonies, seeking matching funding from the Foreign  Office for churches and the stipends of ministers sent out by the CCS.  47    Over the next three months, letters were sent around the globe to the  bishops of Nova Scotia, Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, seeking infor- mation about their dioceses. Not all were pleased to be approached.  Bishop John Inglis   of Nova Scotia, who had been similarly forthright  concerning the Newfoundland School Society, replied that he saw no  need for the formation of a new missionary society, and objected to  a number of its rules.  48   The Clerical Secretary wore himself out on  the home circuit, visiting Liverpool, Dublin, Glasgow, Edinburgh,  Manchester and Birmingham. While he had a cordial reception in  Dublin, where the collection raised £86, the situation in Liverpool,  Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham was not encouraging. On  19 February, a public meeting was held to set up a Ladies’ Association,  which was helpful, and on 5 March letters were sent directly to the lieu- tenant governors of the colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and  Newfoundland with a tempting offer. The Society promised to send out  a clergyman, with a salary of £150, to any settlement that was able to  contribute an additional £50 a year, so long as the candidate had the  sanction of the local bishop.  49   By this stage, the first offers were already 45      Ibid ., p. 14.     46     First Report [of the CCS] (1837), Australian Joint Copying Project, p. 4.     47     CCS Committee Minutes, 8 January 1839, in London Guildhall Library, MS 15,673, vol. 1, p. 1.     48     CCS Committee Minutes, 5 February 1839, London Guildhall Library, MS 15,673, vol. 1, p. 6.     49     CCS Committee Minutes, 5 March 1839, London Guildhall Library, MS 15,673, vol. 1, p. 12
 flowing in from clergy proposing themselves for mission postings in the  colonies.
 In another coup, the fledgling Society was delighted when a leader  of the Evangelical party, Edward Bickersteth   (1786–1850), agreed to  preach the Society’s annual sermon.  50   Bickersteth’s sermon, printed  with the report for 1839, was something of a spiritual call to arms.  51   In  his thumbnail sketches of Exeter Hall   speakers by ‘one of the Protestant  party’,  52   there is this portrait of Bickersteth: Every Missionary Association throughout the country knows and loves  Mr Bickersteth; and to the London audience the anniversary is incomplete,  unless Mr Bickersteth be there. I have often thought that his is the  beau idéal   of the Society. The images he excites in the mind combine foreign service and  home exertion, a perfect knowledge of all its doings abroad, and all its plans and  wishes in committee. His dark, sallow countenance, hollow cheek and eye, ema- ciated figure, and sepulchral voice, give us as perfect a picture of the exhausted  Missionary in person, as his benevolent smile, active carriage, and affectionate  address present an excellent portraiture of the Missionary in spirit.  53
 We can easily picture him then, rising to preach on the text: ‘But if  any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house,  he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an Infidel.’ Bickersteth  declaimed on the national duty to proclaim the Protestant Reformed  religion established by law throughout the colonies and garrison  them against the twin evils of heathenism and popery.  54   According to  Bickersteth’s correspondents, throughout the empire ships were arriv- ing loaded with Roman Catholic bishops, priests and seminarians from  Maynooth, and there was a desperate need for Evangelical clergy to  defend the Reformation in Britain’s expanding colonies. It was a theme  he warmed to on other occasions,  55   and it lent a motivating zeal to the  work of the Society as it did to some other Evangelical institution build- ing and expansion at home.
 Why was the Colonial Church Society expanding at just this time?  As Bickersteth makes clear, Catholic emancipation  , the Irish Tithe Act 50     CCS Committee Minutes, 2 April 1839, London Guildhall Library, MS 15,673,  vol. 1, p. 12.

 (1838)   and the steady appointment of Catholic chaplains and bishops  to the colonies, all aroused fears among conservative Protestants of a  Catholic colonial threat.  56   This would be sufficient reason for organ- ising an effective Evangelical response. However, another factor may  have been the background to the launch of the Colonial Bishoprics’  Fund   which eventually occurred in 1841. The purpose of the Fund was  to allow the expansion of the Church of England to cater for ‘mem- bers of our National Church residing in the British colonies, and in  distant parts of the world’, as it was expressed in the original state- ment following the meeting of archbishops and bishops in Lambeth on  Whit Tuesday (1 June) 1841.  57   By suggesting that there was a ‘National  Church’ in the colonies, this excited tremendous interest in what was  seen as the main body of the church taking up its pastoral responsi- bilities in the empire. However, Evangelicals also anticipated conflict  between the colonial bishops and the Evangelical societies, including  the CMS, who had up until then played a leading role in pioneering  missions in colonial territories.  58
 The opposition of the bishop of Nova Scotia to the creation of the  CCS was, therefore, no minor blip. Inglis wrote at length expressing his  opposition to the new Society on the ground that it represented a direct  rival to both the SPG and the newly created Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund.    He distributed his objections as widely as possible by means of a printed  circular. Chairman T. Lewin and the Secretary E. A. Cotton replied  with equal deliberation and elaborate formulations of respect.  59   They  argued that the SPG was inadequate to the task of serving the colonial  church and that the new society would not impact on its finances. The  Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund was in its infancy and the colonies needed  all the support they could muster. Indeed, the statistics of the bishop’s  own diocese, despite his exertions over the previous fifteen years, dem- onstrated the need for a new missionary philosophy for the colonies: The committee are happy to acknowledge the energy and activity which your  lordship has displayed; but after all your lordship’s exertions, aided by the funds 56     J.

 of the Propagation Society, what is the real state of the diocese? From a recent  return, it would appear that there are only thirty working clergymen for a popu- lation of 250,000 souls, dispersed over an area of 15,000 square miles.  60
 Inglis’ reply, which stressed the need to retain the unity of the Church,  like the seamless garment of the crucified Redeemer, had dignity, but  he could not really answer the weight of the CCS’s arguments. The  Society was plainly necessary. With its flawless Evangelical credentials,  it had access to the serious-minded young men who would answer the  call to go out and make careers in the colonies and make the ‘National  Church in the British Colonies’ a working reality.
 Tussles with the high church party, providentialism – the argument  that God had ordained that the Society would succeed – and British  patriotism, all helped to provide a rhetorical rationale for the work of  the Society. However, the actual work of sending out missionaries and  schoolteachers, and helping to build schools and churches, advanced  rather more slowly than its committee would have liked. While depre- cating the efforts of the SPG and the bishop of Nova Scotia, in truth the  CCS struggled to do much better. Out in the colonies, throughout the  1830s and 1840s, the CCS gradually extended its work from its original  base in Western Australia   to the other Australian colonies and beyond  them to the West Indies  , British North America, and southern Africa.  Publicity was provided by publishing a stream of letters from mission- aries once they arrived in the field. These make for poignant reading  as tentative beginnings are tempered by the challenge of the frontier  conditions. In the remote Swan River Colony of Western Australia,  where the number of colonists had just managed to exceed 2,000 in  1836, Giustiniani   reported that the roof was rising on the first church  in the colony and that he hoped to be able to open it on Christmas Day  for divine service.  61   This was somewhat ingenuous since services were  regularly performed in the Perth Court House by the colonial chaplain,  and there was also a Wesleyan chapel elsewhere. Indeed, the colonial  authorities seem to have imagined Giustiniani, who had erected a chapel  and schoolhouse at Guildford, was planning a mission to the Aborigines  rather than the settlers.  62   As in Newfoundland  , it was by no means sure 60      British Magazine and Monthly Register , 20 (1841), p. 329.     61     According to the  First Report  [of the CCS] (1837), p. 3, Louis (or Luigi) Giustiniani was a convert and former Roman Catholic priest who had been the Roman Catholic  chaplain to the Austrian embassy in Rome. I have not been able to confirm these  details, nor that he was a ‘Jesuit turned Protestant’, a Lutheran, or ‘probably of noble  Venetian descent’ as claimed in J. Jupp,  The Australian People: An Encyclopedia of the  Nation, Its People and Their Origins  (Cambridge, 2001), p. 492.
 Evangelicals and the colonies A second phase in the development of the Evangelical mission to the  colonies arose in the 1840s in the context of a widening rift between  Evangelicals and other members of the Church of England. On the one  hand, this was a time of extraordinary achievement for the Church,  which was spiritually rejuvenated by the Oxford movement and the  reforming zeal of Evangelicals in almost every sphere of social life.  Overseas, the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund   led to a rapid increase in the  number of clergy and the Church gained prestige from the arrival of  numerous ambitious and articulate leaders to assert local authority. On  the other, there was continued anxiety about the loyalty and ortho- doxy of those within the Tractarian movement and the danger they  were imagined to pose to the colonies. Conflicts about ritual and wor- ship threatened to derail the great revival of the Anglican Church and  the special accommodation between its Catholic and Protestant tradi- tions which had been the hallmark of its success as a national institu- tion. While some breathed a sigh of relief when prominent Tractarians  ,  including John Keble   and Edward Pusey  , departed for Rome in 1845–6,  the real trouble was just beginning.
 Disputes erupted in two fields. In the first place, there were direct  concerns about increasing financial support by the state to Roman  Catholics at what was perceived to be the expense of religious volun- tarists and Britain’s own established Protestant churches. There were  strenuous objections to the expansion of the grant to the national Irish  seminary at Maynooth   by the Peel government in 1845. Nevertheless,  the uproar on this occasion was modest by comparison with the extraor- dinary reaction by British Protestants to the restoration of the Catholic  hierarchy in England and Wales by Pius IX   in 1850. Although there  were already three Catholic hierarchies in the empire – in Ireland,  Quebec   and Australia   – the ensuing moral panic over the alleged ‘papal  aggression’   was one of the major events of the Victorian age.  63
 Secondly, there were bitter struggles within the Church of England  about ecclesiastical appointments and the traditional authority of bishops  to rule on the theological orthodoxy of clergy in their diocese. The most  rancorous of these battles for theological precedence was the Gorham 63     W. Ralls, ‘The Papal Aggression of 1850: A Study in Victorian Anti-Catholicism’,   Church History , 43 (1974), p. 244.
 case  . George Cornelius Gorham   (1787–1857) was an Evangelical min- ister whose views on baptism were declared to be ‘unsound’ by Henry  Phillpotts  , bishop of Exeter, who decided for this reason to refuse to  institute him to a living in his diocese, thereby destroying his liveli- hood.  64   On appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in  March 1850, Phillpotts was ordered to reinstate Gorham, a judgment  which Evangelicals saw as a triumph for the English constitution and  the rule of law, and Anglo-Catholics   as an appalling intrusion by the  state in the proper jurisdiction of a bishop. The Gorham case cannot be  extricated from the colonial church because, in a rash move, the bish- ops of Australia and New Zealand gathered for the 1850 Australasian  bishops’ conference   had lent the weight of their assembly to a statement  on baptism, the very issue that had been the focus of the Gorham dis- pute.  65   As one might expect, this divided along church party lines, with  one statement signed by the bishops of Sydney, Adelaide, New Zealand,  Newcastle and Tasmania, and another by the sole Evangelical, Charles  Perry  , bishop of Melbourne, who was a protégé of the CMS Secretary,  Henry Venn  .  66   From this time, colonial Evangelicals feared that high  church bishops would use their majority influence in the colonies to  proscribe Evangelicals, dominate colonial synods and block their access  to appeal to the Privy Council.
 As a major vehicle for the colonial work of the Evangelical party in  the Church of England, the Newfoundland School Society and the  Colonial Church Society had played an important part in these sectar- ian disputes. It was now time to unify their forces.
 Colonial Church and School Society (1851) Because of a gap in the surviving records of the Society’s meetings,  67    it is no longer clear why or how the Newfoundland School Society and  the Colonial Church Society were brought together.   However, it was  sufficiently urgent to interrupt the holiday season. Just two days before  Christmas 1850, while Parliament rang with speeches declaiming the  imminent collapse of Britain as a Protestant nation, representatives 64     O. Chadwick,  The Victorian Church, Part One, 1829–1859  (London, 1966), pp. 250–2.     65     For the minutes of the meeting, see R. A. Giles,  The Constitutional History of the Australian Church  (London, 1929), pp. 237–47.     66      Ibid ., pp. 243–5; A. de Q.

 of the two societies met in London. The meeting decided that, from  1 January 1851, the NSS and the CCS should form a united society  to be called the ‘Colonial Church and School Society for sending  Clergymen, Catechists, and Schoolmasters, to the Colonies of Great  Britain, and the British Residents in other parts of the world’.  68
 In the 1850s and 1860s, the amalgamated society maintained the  hearty Evangelicalism of its two predecessors, but it had more ambi- tious plans. These included a takeover (from the bishop of London)  of responsibility for chaplaincies in continental Europe.  69   It also filled  the void left by battles between   Tractarians and Evangelicals in the  diocese of Natal following the Colenso case   (1863) – another dispute  involving the authority of a high church bishop.  70   As always, it was  lack of funds more than anything else which limited the expansion of  the Society. By October 1853, the state of the finances was sufficiently  grim that it was resolved to approach the bank to advance the sum of  £500 for six months at 5 per cent interest ‘for which the Committee  hereby hold themselves personally responsible’.  71   The dire necessity  for this probably accounts for the lukewarm reception given to bishop  Perry   of Melbourne, despite his strong Evangelical credentials, who  approached the committee with request for funds to appoint clergy- men to the Victorian goldfields. At the same time, correspondence was  f lowing in from Canada  , the West Indies   and Calcutta, which reported  on the work of agents who had already been despatched to their sta- tions and who required ongoing support. Fund-raising remained very  much the business of the hour when Archdeacon Davies reported that  from 21 August to 17 October he had preached or held meetings in  aid of the Society at Chelsea, Tooting, Ashbourne, Guernsey, Jersey,  Birmingham, Cowes, Ryde, Southborough and Brighton, though he  does not say how much money he raised. The need for such exertions  is well demonstrated when weighed against the periodic appearances  of colonial bishops who came to plead their case to the commit- tee, or in the f low of correspondence. Francis Fulford  , first bishop  of Montreal (1850–68) and an  Anglo-Catholic, paid the CCCS a 68     CCCS Special General Meeting, 27 December 1850, London Guildhall Library, MS  15,674/1, p. 1.
 69     Underwood,  Faith at the Frontiers , p. 45, describes ‘many’ earlier chaplains as ‘debt- ors, drunkards, bankrupts and adventurers who owed allegiance to no bishop and  accepted no ecclesiastical authority’. The Continental Committee began work in  1856.

 visit in December 1853 before departing to take up his post in Lower  Canada.  72   He stressed the Roman Catholic influences which were  ‘paramount in the administration of affairs’ and the need to match  their efforts. Although sympathetic, the Society was unable to respond  effectively and this seems to have had little or nothing to do with the  churchmanship of the supplicant bishop. Faced with a small budget  and multiple demands, they adopted the policy of part-funding all  requests and requiring local people to make up the balance of the   salaries of both clergy and schoolteachers despatched to the colonies.  It seems to have created the breathing space that was needed.

 At the end of this series of bleak pictures comes the appeal: ‘These tracts  now fall into the hands of the Colonial Church, which, being unable  to do the work alone, requires help from outside.’ In the Americas,  the CCCS committed itself to providing religious services to people for  whom there was no other provision. These came to include missions to  British sailors in colonial and foreign ports, to fugitive slaves on their  arrival in Canada, and to Catholic populations in British colonies such  as Malta  . The Society was making a reputation as an organisation that  would go to places neglected by every other missionary organisation.
 Emigration Emigration and the drama of colonisation also proved the basis for a  reformed rhetoric for the combined society, one which gave it a wider  appeal beyond the narrower band of conservative Protestants who had  earlier been the mainstay of the Society. London Evangelicals, who led  the way in many reforming movements in the nineteenth century, seem 76     Cited by Bob Lyons, ‘The Diary of a Saddlebag Preacher’,  The Bancroft Times   (11 February 1987).

 to have been among the first to recognise that there needed to be more  organised and direct support for emigrants and settlers. The usual way  this was done was by arranging speakers and collections for those in  attendance. Visiting colonial bishops took advantage of the Evangelical  network to preach on behalf of the colonial mission cause. Vincent  Ryan  , the first bishop of Mauritius (1854–88), delivered one such  sermon on behalf of the Colonial Church and School Society in the  Chapel of Ease, Islington, in 1855. His text was Galatians 6: 10: ‘As  we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially  unto them who are of the household of faith.’  78   This makes an excellent  text for a promotion of the colonial church and for the emigrants, set- tlers, sailors in foreign ports and fugitive slaves served by the CCCS.  As usual, the bishop supplied figures to support his case and also  drew on his own experience. In Mauritius  , there was a large popula- tion of emancipated slaves among whom a single zealous layman was  active. There were also over 100,000 Indian coolies, ‘very accessible  to Christian effort for their moral and spiritual improvement’.  79   Later  in his episcopate, Ryan was inclined to be less optimistic about the  character of the many former slaves and apprentices in his diocese.  80    The need of the diocese of Sydney, as reported in a recent appeal by  the bishop, was also very pressing. In four years the population had  risen from 35,000 to 60,000, but, of the five churches in Sydney open  for public worship, only one was completed. And, finally, there was a  plea for clergy to offer themselves for service to the isolated interior  of Australia   with a promise that they would be warmly received, and  (despite the dire warning administered earlier about the heathen status  of poor white emigrants) that the emigrants were not all without edu- cation or courtesy.  81
 Geography and statistics were tools deployed by the Society to press  home its message. In the Society’s annual report, one favoured method  for dramatising the differences between the scale of the need and the  available resources was to print maps of colonial territories overprinted  with insert maps of the British homeland. On a map of the Dominion  of Canada, for example, the whole of the British Isles was swallowed  up in capacious reaches of Hudson’s Bay;  82   England floated in the 78     V. W.

 The new, broader and less sectarian appeal was effective, but only  to a certain extent. There had been strong growth in the income of the  CCCS following the merging of the Newfoundland School   Society and  the Colonial Church Society in 1851. Combined income trebled in the  ten years to 1861. However, it did not really get much higher than this  and stayed more or less stagnant for the next thirty years, despite a con- siderable increase in the population both at home and abroad. This is  clear from  Table 5.1 .
 How do we explain these lacklustre figures, especially when they  are compared with receipts by the CMS and other foreign mission- ary societies for the middle decades of the nineteenth century? As for  the SPG, this period was not a time of growth for the CCCS or the  colonial missionary movement in general. Sectarian rivalry, which had  been important to the society’s formation and growth in the 1850s,  was less effective in sustaining enthusiasm for the cause after the first  great wave of settlement had flowed to the colonies. In addition, colo- nial disestablishment had removed the most significant organisational  barrier which had stood between the Episcopal and Nonconformist  churches, and encouraged their closer cooperation. The new voluntar- ist environment also put renewed emphasis on the personal qualities  of the bishops who were forced to raise funds to support their own  plans for expansion. In frontier regions, the most successful bishops  were able to reconcile the warring church parties in the greater cause  of church unity and development. Competition with other churches,  notably the Methodists and Catholics, also had a sobering influence  on those inclined to sustain old world party grievances in the Church  of England. Representative of this spirit of colonial pragmatism is  the response of William Wood   (fl. 1834–78) who had emigrated from  England to Canada in 1834. In 1848, he became the first agent of the  Colonial Church Society in Ontario. His letters to his family, now in the  Library of the University of Toronto, describe his experience working 83      Ibid ., p. 165.    84      Ibid ., p. 157.     85      Ibid ., map between pp. 110 and 111.
 as an itinerant missionary on behalf of the Society. In 1857, he was  delighted to report that the new bishop of Huron was an Evangelical,  an excellent thing since ‘these high church Puseyites … drive mem- bers away to join other sects’.  86   In the long run, some colonial dioceses  became Evangelical strongholds, others remained high church; most  began eventually to train and recruit their own clergy who tended to  reflect the churchmanship of the ruling bishop. These self-sustaining  churches no longer needed to recruit all their clergy and teachers from  home, thus removing the founding rationale for the CCCS.
 A more telling factor may have been the success of the Colonial  Bishoprics’ Fund   which, with careful nurturing by Gladstone  , became  a vehicle for the ambitions of gifted churchmen of all parties of the  Church of England. Unlike the SPG or the CCCS, it was never domi- nated by one faction within the Church. However, the success of the  Fund was a problem in that it funnelled the lion’s share of private  donations, which in earlier days might have f lowed to the colonial Table 5.1     Income of the Newfoundland School Society (NSS), Colonial  Church Society (CCS), Colonial Church and School Society (CCSS), and  Colonial and Continental Church Society (CCCS), 1831–1909

 missionary societies, for the aid of the colonial churches. The pock- ets of the Anglican faithful were deep, but they were not limitless.  Most preferred to send out a bishop who would then be responsible  for generating a self-supporting church. In these circumstances, the  SPG became increasingly restricted to aiding work on the frontiers of  colonial settlement, and the CCCS did similar work, while continu- ing to assist those who shared its more Protestant vision of colonial  development.
 Greater Britain The Society continued to publish its report in the 1860s, including a  copy of the annual sermon. This was enlivened with occasional sce- nic views, but mostly it stuck to the old formula of narratives from  missionaries in the field, and pleas for more workers in it. From the  diocese of Melbourne came the request for ‘clergymen of piety, mis- sionary spirit, and pulpit power’, or, failing this, ‘young men of educa- tion, ability, and piety, having the qualifications requisite in candidates  for the ministry’.  87   Those who responded to these calls were sent to  places on the margins of the expanding colonial world – The Bend,  Monckton in the diocese of Fredericton, Rum Cay and Fortune Island  in the diocese of Jamaica, Emu Plains and Castlereagh in the diocese  of Sydney, Yandilla in the diocese of Brisbane, or Middle Swan in  the diocese of Perth. Like the Wesleyans, the CCCS recognised the  thrifty virtue of an itinerant ministry. Mr R. Munden,   a catechist from  Yandilla, Darling Downs, wrote of his work in and around Tarawinaba  in Queensland.  88   He held ‘service as usual’ on Sunday and read the  Society’s annual sermon out to the people. On Wednesday, he rode to  Back Creek Station and conversed with a number of Chinese shepherds  and left them some tracts in Chinese. On Friday, he walked to another  shepherd’s station, reading the scripture to the man and his family. On  Saturday, he walked out to Head Station. This was the highlight of the  week. His congregation was generally made up of shepherds on isolated  stations. However, on this occasion he was pleased to be sustained by  what he called a ‘profitable conversation’ with ‘an intelligent Protestant  Irishman’. In such accounts, it is difficult to say who is more to be pit- ied, the men and women on their isolated stations, slaves to the boss  and their sheep, or the itinerant catechist who journeyed out to preach  to them. Mr Munden concluded his report by stating that, in the course 87      Annual Report of the Colonial Church and School Society  (1860), p. 134.     88      Annual Report of the Colonial Church and School Society  (1861), p. 135.
 In order to sustain the work, a new defining ethos was needed, some- thing which would bind colonists and their supporters at home together  and would avoid the party bitterness which was a distraction from the  spiritual and welfare objectives of the Society. The ethos of the empire  provided the answer. By the 1870s, the rhetoric of the society shifted  once more to take up this new strain and we can detect a much greater  recourse to imperial nationalism to justify the expansion of the society.  By his writing, Dilke provided a ready-made identity for the colonial  missionary societies. In 1876, the Colonial and Continental Church  Society   incorporated his term ‘Greater Britain’   into the name of their  journal:  The Greater Britain Messenger    : Colonial and Continental Church  Society Quarterly Paper . The cover picture sums up a new, more upbeat  strategy for the Society. It shows an emigrant vessel with flags flying  ‘Emigrants for Australia’   at one end, and ‘Emigrants for Canada’ at the  other. Below, a mountain scene shows churches amidst mountains with  a sign ‘To the English Service’. Above, missionaries are shown heading  off by dog sled over snow, and by railway. There were advertisements  for the services of visiting speakers, who would be happy to provide  lectures on the following themes: ‘Phases of colonial and continental  life’, ‘Warm hearts in cold regions’, ‘Home from home – what it is and  what I may be’ and ‘Emigrant and missionary life in the colonies’. Here  was a new work for the Society, part religious travel service, part mis- sionary adventure; it was an ideal that was more in tune with the more  optimistic spirit of the later empire. The success of this new strategy is  also reflected in the rising financial fortunes of the CCCS in the first  decade of the twentieth century. In 1909, income reached an all-time  high of £42,426 – swollen by a grant from the Pan-Anglican Thank  Offering Fund. In addition, there were some 350 agents employed by  the Society which now included about 200 stations in the colonies and  140 chaplaincies in Europe. There was also exciting news from the prai- rie churches which the Society was supporting in North-West Canada,  discussed in more detail in connection with the Britannia Colony   in   Chapter 12 . It was with quiet satisfaction that the annual report was headed with the text: ‘The Lord hath been mindful of us: He will bless  us’ (Psalms cxv, 12).
 By the end of the nineteenth century, the CCCS had passed through  several stages that reflect the transformation in the Evangelical move- ment that sustained it. Both the Newfoundland School Society and the  Western Australian Church Society were typical of the small, ardently  Protestant ventures led by laymen which sprang up in vast numbers  to support a host of causes in the early decades of the nineteenth cen- tury. That they survived at all is probably due to the need for a society  that would act as a vehicle for Evangelical resistance to the perceived  influence of the high church movement in the older colonial missionary  societies, especially the SPG. But financial difficulties and the lack of  dynamism in the Society’s leadership (most of whom are non-entities)  meant that it never really did become the empire-wide agency for the  planting of Evangelicalism among the colonists to which it aspired. There  was also the problem of the colonial bishops who were not, in the main,  Evangelicals, and who preferred to appoint clergy who would avoid con- troversy. With funds perennially so short, even the most ultra-Protestant  agent of the Society was forced in the end to deal with the bishop. In the  wake of these clashes, the livelier ethos of the later decades of the cen- tury, which drew on imperialism rather than anti-Catholicism and anti- Tractarianism, is what came to characterise the Society’s promotional  literature. It embraced the ideal of Greater Britain   and the principle  of a wider Christian empire in which settlers were united by race and  faith in the common cause. While never entirely abandoning the older  sectarianism that had fuelled the Society’s earlier activism, this new  ethos also required greater cooperation with non-Anglican Protestants  in their common efforts to Christianise the frontier. The next chap- ter looks at the colonial missions of the Nonconformists, including the  Methodists, and the (Congregationalist) Colonial Missionary Society.
 This chapter considers the colonial missions of British Nonconformists,  that is, Protestants outside the established churches. ‘Nonconformity’  was a term used in the nineteenth century to refer to the new Methodist  churches as well as the older Baptists,   Congregationalists   and Quakers    and a number of smaller groups including the Plymouth Brethren    and the Salvation Army  .  1   Following the Disruption, the Evangelical  Presbyterians, who left the established Church of Scotland to form  the Free Church  , shared many theological and organisational fea- tures with Nonconformists (and Evangelical Anglicans) elsewhere in  Britain. However, although it is convenient to consider them together,  Nonconformists took pride in their independence, and it is important to  pay as much heed to their distinctive cultural, theological and regional  profiles  2   as to those things which they held in common. The character  of the Nonconformist identity also tended to change over time. At the  beginning of the nineteenth century, Wesleyan Methodists   felt closer  to the Church of England and it was only later that they came to feel  part of the relatively cohesive Nonconformist ‘chapel’ culture.  3   The   evangelical revival and, as we will argue in this chapter, the impact  of emigration and imperial expansion, were critical in strengthening  bonds between this diverse group of British Protestants.
 Although they were a minority of the population, Nonconformists    were some of Britain’s most active Christians with a commitment  to both empire and social and political reform and were open to the 1     Nonconformity has been much better studied as a social and political movement  than as an imperial network, though for important surveys see D.

 potential of the colonial empire. In 1851, Nonconformists made up  almost half the attendants at religious services reported in the census of  religious worship in England and Wales; they also claimed to have more  places of worship (though admittedly many were small) than the Church  of England and Catholics combined.  4   Beyond their numerous churches  and chapels, Nonconformists also held a strong grip on British cultural  life through their involvement in school education  . Between them, the  non-denominational British and Foreign School Society and the various  Nonconformist churches conducted over 1600 schools in England and  Wales. Many more children received a regular injection of literacy, bible- reading and morality through the Sunday school movement. In alliance  with Anglican Evangelicals, Congregationalists  , Baptists   and Methodists    formed the core of the numerous evangelical societies   which were consid- ered at the beginning of the last chapter and which helped evangelicals  maintain a stranglehold over Victorian public opinion on questions relat- ing to morality, missions, education and what we would now call social  welfare. Nonconformity had regional strengths; it was a particularly  strong force in Wales where it gradually acquired something of the char- acter of a national religion, an identification encouraged by the revival of  the Welsh language   which was promoted through Nonconformist chap- els. Beyond Britain, Nonconformists   who emigrated to the colonies were  active in establishing auxiliary branches of evangelical societies, includ- ing the Religious Tract Society and the British and Foreign Bible Society,  as well as lending their support to the colonial Sunday school and tem- perance movements, which together ensured that the Nonconformist  conscience was as much an imperial as a national force.
 Nonconformists   held a distinctive view of their historical place  in the nation and the British empire, past and present. Those who  descended most directly from the seventeenth-century Puritans, not- ably the Baptists   and Congregationalists  , placed a premium on their  status as ‘free’ churches, which had rejected state funding and, with 4     For statistics on British church membership  , see Latourette,  Expansion of Christianity ,  vol. VII, pp. 175–223; Cook and Keith,  British Historical Facts , p. 220, Table 3, citing  ‘Report on the 1851 Census of Religious Worship’, Parliamentary Papers (1852–3),  vol. LXXXIX, Table A, pp. clxxviii–clxxix. Out of a total 34,467 places of worship,  Nonconformists (i.e. Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists  , Wesleyans, New  Connexion Methodists, Primitive Methodists, Bible Christians, Wesleyan Methodist  Association, Wesleyan Reformers, Calvinistic Methodists, Unitarians and Quakers)  had 18,608 (54 per cent), Anglicans 14,077 (41 per cent) and Catholics 570 (1.6 per  cent). The number of sittings by Nonconformists was 43 per cent, while Anglicans  had 52 per cent and Catholics less than 2 per cent. According to the Minutes of the  Wesleyan Methodist Conference, in 1850 there were 4,099 Wesleyan Methodists in  Scotland and 21,107 in Ireland.
 it, state interference in their spiritual affairs. Despite forming a power- ful and articulate religious minority in Britain, many Nonconformists  had a shared history of persecution and marginalisation at the hands of  the established Church of England. This played an important role in  determining their views on colonial extension. They remembered that  following the Act of Uniformity (1662)   ministers who refused to con- form their liturgical practice to the Book of Common Prayer had been  ejected from their churches: thousands were imprisoned; some were  executed; and a whole generation chose to emigrate to the more tolerant  shores of America.
 While the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts   (1828) enabled  Nonconformists to enter fully into British public life, many continued  to nurture a tradition which cherished religious liberty, denounced  bishops, church establishments and endowments as agents of tyranny,  and celebrated the Protestant ‘founding fathers’ of the first American  colonies as some of their greatest heroes. One practical effect of the  seventeenth-century ejection of English Nonconformists   was that non- episcopal Protestantism became the majority faith of the American  colonists, who came to characterise themselves as the rightful heirs of  the Reformation. Partly because of effective missionary exertions from  the United States, Baptists  , Congregationalists and Methodists were  a stronger force in British North America than they were in the set- tler colonies of the southern hemisphere. In various ways, therefore,  Protestant Nonconformity was central to the Christian settlement of  the first British empire. An important corollary of this was that – just  as they were on the foreign mission field – American Protestants were  major rivals to British Nonconformists for control and influence over  the frontier churches of British North America.
 The pattern of Nonconformist   extension into the British colonies in  the nineteenth century differed from that in the first British empire.  Methodists  , who had fewer scruples about accepting state aid, were able  to expand more rapidly in colonial territories than voluntarists such as  the Congregationalists. Possibly for this reason, Methodists succeeded  in supplanting other non-Anglican Protestants in the race to plant  chapels in Canadian, Australian and New Zealand   soil. Methodism  seems to have been a creed which suited the young colonial democ- racies and, by the end of the nineteenth century, census returns show  that it had become the largest Protestant denomination in Canada and  the second largest (after the Church of England) in both Australia   and  New Zealand  .  5   It was less significant in the Cape   where competition 5     See  Tables 1.1 – 1.6  for detailed statistics.
 from the combined forces of the Dutch Reformed Church   and Scottish  and Irish Presbyterianism   pushed them into third position. However,  Methodism was an important church for the coloured population, as we  noted in the  first chapter .
 Other Nonconformists disagreed, embraced the principles of Christian  colonialism and created colonial missionary societies of their own.
 The key to the shift in Nonconformist opinion was a redefinition of  colonial settlement so that it was incorporated into the foreign mis- sionary movement. Indeed, the Congregationalist   supporters of the  Colonial Missionary Society would eventually claim that colonial mis- sions should take precedence over the cause of foreign missions: ‘The  MISSIONARY MOVEMENT of the last century was to Christianise  the heathen; the Colonial Missionary Movement of to-day is largely  an attempt to prevent the heathenising of Christians.’  7   While few  would go this far, most Nonconformist churches duly incorporated  colonial mission work into the range of their missionary activities.  This required the rearrangement of some societies to meet the new  need. The constitution of the Baptist Missionary Society   (1817) ori- ginally stated that its object was ‘the diffusion of knowledge of the  religion of Jesus Christ throughout the heathen world’, and this was  generally assumed to exclude the British colonies. In 1843, however, 6     ‘A Strict Baptist View of Emigration, 1853’, in D. Bebbington, K. Dix and A. Ruston,  eds.,  Protestant Nonconformist Texts , vol. 3,  The Nineteenth Century , 4 vols.

 the Society decided to change the wording to refer to ‘the whole world  beyond the British Isles’.  8   This allowed it to incorporate the Baptist  Colonial Missionary Society   (1836) which worked in the province of  Upper Canada  . The Baptist Missionary Society also supported colo- nial missions to America and the Australian colonies from 1838 to  1850.  9
 Nonconformists were divided into a large number of separate  churches, and this tended to limit what they were able to achieve  through their voluntary missionary societies, even when they worked  together, as they often did. As Jeffrey Cox   notes, prior to the success  of the Congregationalist   and Baptist Unions, the missionary soci- eties functioned to some degree as denominational surrogates for  these groups.  10   Colonial missions were an important component of the  work of the three largest Nonconformist denominations: Methodists,  Congregationalists and Baptists  . In this chapter, there is space to con- sider only the two largest of these: namely, the Wesleyan Methodist  Missionary Society (formed between 1814 and 1818) and the Colonial  Missionary Society (1836), both of which have extensive printed and  archival sources relating to their work in the colonial field  .  11
 Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society (WMMS) Missionary work was conducted by Methodists   from the earliest days  of the movement. However, it was not until 1817 that the Methodist  Conference felt it was necessary to centralise this work which had  earlier been conducted by locally based societies. From this time, the  General Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society coordinated the  raising of funds for foreign missions, including the outfitting and des- patch of missionaries, receiving accounts and journals of their work,  and preparing and publishing a substantial report. Information about  Wesleyan Methodist missionary work was published in the Society’s  most important periodical,  Missionary Notices , first published in 1816; 8     B. Stanley,  The History of the Baptist Missionary Society 1792–1992  (Edinburgh, 1992),  p. 215.
 they also appeared in the  Arminian Magazine , first published 1778.  12    In its first report, the object of the WMMS was said to be no more  than the better organisation of the work of Wesleyan Methodists and  of others ‘who are friends to the conversion of the Heathen World, and  to the preaching of the Gospel, generally, in Foreign Lands’.  13   The  effect of this was to ensure that Methodist missions were never really  separated from the control of the Wesleyan Conference in the way of  the voluntary associations such as the London Missionary   Society, the  Church Missionary Society   or the Glasgow Missionary Society   and  Glasgow Colonial Society   (though these societies were later brought  under the direct control of the Assembly of the Church of Scotland).  Nor were Methodist missions to the heathen abroad distinguished  from those to Europeans, Jews or British colonists overseas. Until they  established their own independent Conferences, calls for missionary  assistance from British settlers in new countries of settlement were  directly under the control of the British Conference and were highly  regulated. Colonial missions to Methodist settlers in Canada began  in the 1780s and continued until the establishment of an inde  pendent  Canadian Conference in 1854; missions to Australasia began in 1818,  to New Zealand   and elsewhere in the Pacific in 1822 and continued  until independence in 1855; missions to South Africa   began in 1814  and closed with independence in 1882.  14
 From the beginning, Wesleyan Methodist   missionary work was  linked directly to the call of British patriotism. In their publications,  Methodist missions were represented as a duty laid on the British nation  by Christ that should therefore have no boundaries. In 1820, a meeting  of the Liverpool auxiliary of the WMMS gave its support to missions  in India, Africa, New South Wales, North America and Europe in the  following way:  15

 The colonies of British settlement were part of this mighty work of  Providence. On reports from New South Wales, where three chapels  had been erected and many new circuits established, it notes approv- ingly: ‘We trust, by the blessing of God, that the foundations of an  industrious and religious state of society will speedily be laid in a coun- try which cannot fail ultimately to have an important influence in  extending the kingdom of Christ in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.’  17    Not surprisingly, the practical difficulties of coordinating this world- wide effort were daunting. By 1824, the full report of the Wesleyan  Methodist Missionary Society ran to 142 closely printed pages, with  another 94 pages listing the names of contributors from auxiliaries and  individuals all around the world.
 The call of imperial patriotism is also evident in the reports from  the WMMS auxiliaries in the colonies. Although the lion’s share of  contributions to the WMMS came from Britain itself, colonial aux- iliaries assisted the Society at home by raising funds locally and sus- taining enthusiasm for the cause among the Nonconformist colonial  bourgeoisie who tended to make up their membership. We can exam- ine one in detail. The Wesleyan Auxiliary Missionary Society for New  South Wales   met for the first time on 5 July 1820 with a committee  made up of the various laymen and all the missionaries who were  then in the colony, including the Reverend Walter Lawry   and William  Walker in Parramatta, the Reverend Benjamin Carvosso   in Windsor,  and the Reverend Ralph Mansfield  , who acted as clerical secretary.  The first Annual Meeting, held in Macquarie-street Chapel in Sydney  on 1 October 1821, was chaired by the Reverend Samuel Leigh  . This  focused on work among the heathen, noting ‘with lively interest’ the  projected missions to the South Seas and hailing ‘with joy’ the estab- lishment of a mission to the Aborigines   of New South Wales.  18   The New  South Wales auxiliary saw its work as part of a great imperial enter- prise, a ‘holy cause’ kindled throughout the British empire: ‘A portion  of that heavenly fervour has reached the southern world. The inhabit- ants of this remote region have not been deaf to the calls of suffering 16      Ibid ., p. 2 ( Reports of Missionary Societies  (n. 15 above), p. 10).     17      Ibid ., p. 11 ( Reports of Missionary Societies  (n. 15 above), p. 19).     18      First Report of the Wesleyan Auxiliary Missionary Society for New South Wales for 1821
 For colonial auxiliaries, foreign missions provided an opportunity to  participate in a great overseas adventure, which, by definition, tended  to happen somewhere else. By 1830, the New South Wales auxiliary  was celebrating its tenth anniversary and reflecting on the previous  decade’s work, carried out against a background of imperial conflict,  most notably involving Russia: ‘The British Churches’, it states, ‘were  not diverted by these political conflicts from their Master’s work; their  altars still smoked with the pure incense of prayer – their hearts still  beat high with a holy ambition for the universal empire of the Prince  of Peace – nor did they relax in their efforts to obey the call which  reached them from heathen lands, “Men and brethren, come over and  help us!”’ It was hoped that this invitation would inspire a spirit of  pious emulation and encourage Australian Methodists to replicate the  work of the home societies. The report concludes: ‘May Australia be  as eminently the light of the South, as Great Britain incontestably is  of the North; and may her sons and her daughters, by thus becoming  the instruments of turning many to righteousness, shine as stars in the  kingdom of heaven for ever and ever.’  22   The reality was rather more  mundane, and, as might be expected, focused rather more on building  churches at home and rather less on sending missionaries abroad than  the rhetoric of its anniversary literature suggested. However, all colo- nial missions were girded about with the language of empire so that  the most insignificant chapel could be seen, in a certain southern light, 19      Ibid ., Report Read at the First Anniversary, 1 October 1821 ( Reports of Missionary  Societies  (n. 15 above), p. 329).

 Primitive Methodists Among the Methodists, colonial mission work was not the prerogative  of the Wesleyans alone. It also occupied a central place in the mission- ary work of the minor Methodist societies, particularly those whose  membership was drawn from the aspiring working classes for whom  emigration provided an opportunity for social betterment.  23   Both the  ‘Ranters’ (Primitive Methodists) and the New Connexion Methodists    provided news of colonists, emigration and colonial missions in their  journals. Of the two groups, the Ranters threw themselves into church  extension work with greater enthusiasm. By 1843, the Primitive  Methodist Missionary Society   was supporting forty-three stations in  Great Britain as well as missions to North America, where the first mis- sionary was sent in 1829, and Australia and New Zealand in 1844.  24   Mrs  R. P. Hopper   bases her history of the Primitive Methodists   in Canada  partly on her own memory of its pioneers. She characterises the origins  of the Movement not as a schism but rather as ‘a child of Providence’  with a mission to bring vitality to all English Methodism. She calls it  ‘a gospel to the poor’.  25   The first Primitive Methodist to begin work in  Canada, Robert Walker,   emigrated to the city of Quebec with his wife  and six children. On his arrival in 1829, he simply began preaching in  a market square, gathering a group of Primitive Methodist emigrants  from Yorkshire around him.  26
 Camp meetings, robust singing, an egalitarian ethos and a sense of  joyful Christian community were characteristics of Primitive Methodist  meetings. These qualities made them attractive to emigrants cut off  from their home churches. The English Conference gave responsi- bility for the Canadian mission to the Hull circuit, which sustained  the Canadian chapels with a stream of ministers and emigrants from 23     In the 1830s, Wesleyan Methodism   in England lost up to 100,000 members following  a series of schisms. In order of their combined attendances at morning, afternoon and  evening services, the most important groupings at the time of the 1851 religious cen- sus were: Wesleyans, 63.9 per cent (1,513,304); Primitive Methodists, 21.1 per cent  (50,0331); New Connexion Methodists, 4.1 per cent (98,041); Wesleyan Methodist  Association, 3.8 per cent (90,145); and Bible Christians, 3 per cent (72,695).

 northern England. More assistance from the English Conference came  in 1844 with a visit from ‘Venerable’ Hugh Bourne   (1772–1852), one of  the two founders of Primitive Methodism. Bourne supported the exten- sion of the sect by constant preaching and touring in Great Britain and  Ireland as well as Canada and the United States.  27   In Canada, Methodist  Union (1883) ended the separate identity of Primitive Methodism which  retained to the end an English character and organisational structure.
 Methodist New Connexion The Methodist New Connexion was also keen to display their colo- nial credentials. The Connexion issued a brief (twelve to sixteen page)  ‘Missionary Chronicle’ as part of the  Methodist New Connexion Magazine  and Evangelical Repository , which included extracts of letters from mis- sionaries in Canada and Australia   as well as China. This was replaced  by  Gleanings in Harvest Fields  (1866–1907) which had the subtitle: ‘Work  in the Methodist New Connexion Missions at Home and Abroad’. The  extension of the Connexion in Britain and abroad was seen as a vital  sign of the life of the movement, and a recognition of the legitimacy of  its secession from the Wesleyan mainstream. In 1847, the Liverpool  meeting of the New Connexion Missionary Society reported on its mis- sions in Ireland and Canada.  28   The report was made in a calamitous  year in which the continuing effects of the famine in Ireland, and refu- gees in Canada, made a loud call on the members’ charity. Missionary  work was clearly envisioned as a three-pronged effort: to the society at  home, to the ‘perishing heathen’, and to the mission in Canada, which  is called ‘that vast, and interesting portion of the British empire’.  29   In  Ireland, however, there was terrible news. By the visitation of a mys- terious Providence, at least two-thirds of the people, we were left with  ‘cleanness of teeth in all our cities’ (Amos 4: 6). The passage from scrip- ture described the conditions of purification and penance imposed by  God prior to the final judgement. All the societies and congregations of  the movement were affected by the eschatological mood.
 Despite these traumas, the New Connexion Methodists reported  sustained growth, supporting ten missionary stations in Ireland, and  no less than thirty in Canada. The famine in Ireland may have helped 27     H. B. Kendall,  The Origin and History of the Primitive Methodist Church   , 2 vols.  (London, 1905), vol. 1, pp. 436–8, notes that the Canadian mission was more suc- cessful than that to the United States.
 Indeed, thanks in part to the exertions of men and women like Crofts,  the Lord would seem to have favoured all branches of Methodism, for  they all did well in the colonies, generally growing at a faster rate than  the Anglican churches. Their expansion was helped by their flexible  organisational structure, which deployed lay preachers on the frontiers  of settlement, while maintaining a clear line of authority to the annual  Conference. Methodists also knew how to encourage colonial independ- ence. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the British Connexion  of the largest, Wesleyan branch of Methodism was no longer willing or 30     Ken Russell, ‘Canadian Methodist Ministers, 1800–1925’.  http://freepages. genealogy. rootsweb.ancestry.com/~methodists/ .

 able to continue its support for colonial missions. Instead, it was insist- ing that the colonies create their own separate Connexions that would  take on the responsibility not only for their own clergy, chapel and cir- cuits, but also for foreign mission work. Methodists in Australia   and  New Zealand   were urged to adopt the Pacific as their special sphere of  responsibility, just as those in North America were engaged in Africa  and Asia. This was not achieved without some colonial disgruntlement.  On the twentieth anniversary of the foundation of the Society in New  South Wales, the annual report addresses for the first time the issue  of the competing claims of heathen missions and missions to other  Christians: If the object of our missionary enterprise were only to spread nominal  Christianity, our exclusive sphere would be amongst the heathen, and when the  Christian name should be universally adopted, we might cherish the utmost  complacency in the work of our own hands.  32
 The creation of independent Wesleyan churches was touted as an  ideal; however, this ignored the reality that British Wesleyans did not  have the colonial field to themselves. Not only did they face rivalry  from other British Nonconformists, but in North America there was  vigorous competition from the American Methodist churches. While  the WMMS was slowly extricating itself from colonial engagements  in Australia   and New Zealand  , the home missionary movement in the  United States   was supplanting the influence of the British churches 32      The Twenty-Third Report of the Auxiliary Wesleyan Missionary Society of New South  Wales, 1843–4  (Sydney: Kemp and Fairfax, 1841), p. 13 [Reports of the Missionary  Societies, p. 669].
 among emigrants moving with the western frontier. It was also active in  British North America. In the United States, the strongest churches in  this internal settlement were those that had been planted most firmly  in the older colonies: Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Baptists  ,  as well as the more recently settled American Methodists.  35   Rivalry  between the British and the American Wesleyan movement was intense.  Indeed, it was war.
 Missionary war Wesleyan Methodism in Canada was subjected to particular strain as  it addressed the competing claims of the American churches and those  that remained connected with the British tradition.  36   The contestation  between various branches of Nonconformity in Canada reflects much  deeper tensions than mere sectarian rivalry. In determining whom they  should give their loyalties to, Canadian Methodists   were confronted  with the same conflicts that had led to rebellion and republicanism  south of the border. Indeed, as Colin Read has argued, clashes between  Baptists   and Methodists with opposing loyalties to the American and  British Connexions were significant antecedents to the rising in west- ern Upper Canada   in 1837–8.  37
 This justifies a little excursion into the history of Methodism in  the United States. In his lifetime, John Wesley had sent preachers to the  American colonies but they had all been ordered to return when the  American Revolution began. Although the Reverend Thomas Coke  returned as Wesley’s chosen supervisor of the American church, the  subsequent expansion of Methodism was almost entirely initiated  by native-born Americans. Americans were also active in extending  the church on the western and northern frontiers of both the United  States and Canada. The province of Upper Canada   (now Ontario) was   initially settled by United Empire Loyalists who began arriving after  1783. Despite their British loyalism, it was the New York Methodist  Conference that sent ministers to the settlers along the St Lawrence  River and later the Niagara circuit. These circuits were served by fit,  active men (and sometimes their wives) working the itinerant system set  up by John Wesley. As Henry Crofts could testify, they needed physical  stamina for long journeys on horseback and psychological toughness 35     Latourette,  Expansion of Christianity , vol. 7, pp. 175–223. See also C. B. Goodykoontz,   Home Missions on the American Frontier  (Caldwell, ID, 1939).
 for the equally long absences from their families.  38   In the peace that fol- lowed the war of 1812 with France, British emigration to Lower Canada  was encouraged in order to secure British control of its new province,  bringing with it many new Methodists as settlers.  39   The newly formed  Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society was also anxious to send mis- sionaries to Canada along with their agents who were being despatched  to other mission fields. This soon led to conflict with the existing mis- sionary arrangements of the American Church. In what has been called  the ‘missionary war’, American and British Methodists vied for control  of the rich pickings of the Canadian mission fields.  40   This was partly  resolved in 1820 when a compact was signed which ceded the occu- pation of Upper Canada   to the Americans and Lower Canada to the  English Conference. This was a concession to the greater strength of  the American church, which at this stage had 3,000 members com- pared with some 744 controlled by the English. Further difficulties fol- lowed as the Methodists in both Canadas resisted their incorporation  by the British Conference.
 The Union of the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Wesleyans,  and the subsequent formation of the Wesleyan Methodist Church   of  Canada in 1833, led to closer ties with Britain and the arrival of a series  of English Presidents for the Canadian Conference. Unhappy with the  loss of the independence of local preachers, a group chose to reject the  Union and form a breakaway Methodist Episcopal Church in Canada;  they eventually rejoined the Wesleyan Methodist Church   in 1847. A  more distinctive Canadian colonial nationalism was encouraged with  the unification of Upper and Lower Canada in 1841, though tensions  between English and American strands of Methodism continued to be  expressed. Branches of English Methodism, including the Primitive  Methodists and the Bible Christians, had missionary programmes in  Canada that ensured that controversies and excitement from English  Methodism were seeded in British North America. In 1884, these divi- sions were resolved in a Union of Canadian Methodism that incorpo- rated all the strands of Methodism into a single church.
 When the Methodist Church   of Canada celebrated the centenary  of Canadian Methodism in 1884, it had become firmly established as  the largest Protestant Church in Canada. As the  Centennial History   exulted: ‘What hath God wrought? To Him let all praise be given! Who  could have predicted that in the ninetieth year of its age in Canada, 38     K. A. Moyer,  My Saddle Was My Study: The Story of the Methodist Saddlebag Preachers  of Upper Canada    (Elmira, Ontario, 1974).
 Methodism would occupy a position numerically in advance of all the  Protestant Churches of the Dominion?’  41   From 1871 until 1884, while  the population increased by 25 per cent, the number of Methodists had  increased by 35 per cent. From this position of strength, the General  Conference of Canadian Methodists began to take full responsibil- ity for its own church extension work using the language of imperial  expansion. An address to the General Conference in 1883 decried the  waste created by Methodist division, and applauded efforts to direct  church resources to the North-West and its swelling tides of emigrants  from the older provinces and the Old World: ‘It is an hour of highest  privilege and duty. We are laying the foundations of empire in right- eousness and truth. We are moulding the institutions of the future;  we are shaping the destiny of the country. The heralds of the Cross  must follow the adventurous pioneer to the remotest settlement of  the Saskatchewan, the Qu’Appelle, and the Peace River, and the vast  region beyond.’  42   By the time of the centenary of Canadian Methodist  Missions (1924), there is a notable shift in self-perception of Canadian  Methodists, which places them alongside central events in Canadian  history – Methodist lay preachers, for example, are said to have come  to Quebec in the army of General Wolfe and hence participated in the  British conquest.  43   The formation of new Methodist communities is  depicted by Stephenson not as the result of missionary overtures from  Britain, but as the response to invitations from settlers.  44   Canada is no  longer at the frontier of missionary efforts but (as in maps that feature  as endpapers of the centenary history) is the centre for a thrusting out- ward missionary movement of her own  .
 Independent Wesleyan Methodist churches Of all the major British churches, the British Methodist Conference  was probably the most eager to ensure that its colonial missions were  transformed into independent national churches. The elevation of the  Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Conference in 1855, like the estab- lishment of the Canadian Conference the year before (1854), and that  of the Cape and Natal in 1882, put these churches on a footing of sig- nificantly greater independence from the metropole than the other large 41      Centennial History , p. 301.     42     J.

 denominational presences in the Australian colonies, the Church of  England and the Catholic Church. Reflecting this numerical success,  in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, Wesleyans made claims to the  colonial government for recognising them, rather than the Anglicans or  Catholics, as the Church with the most flexible and thrifty organisation  and hence the one best fitted to carry the aspirations of the emerging  nations of Greater Britain  . In 1846, William B. Boyce  , Chairman of  the Wesleyan Church in Australasia, wrote to the Colonial Secretary  pointing out the Wesleyans had effectively covered not only the towns  but also the rural districts of a vast territory. They understood how to  create an effective colonial ministry which deployed lay agents, rather  than an expensively educated professional ministry, and sustained a  thrifty itinerant system instead of costly churches: ‘To the Colonial  Government, and to the colonists, the Wesleyan ministers feel that they  have not been unprofitable servants.’  45   In their tussles with Anglicans  in New Zealand, Wesleyans asserted the same view that theirs was the  most effective church   for the colonial world and that New Zealand had  no need of an established church.
 An important mark of independence of the colonial churches was  their commitment to taking on responsibility for other foreign mission  work,   especially in their region. The motivation for this was both finan- cial and practical. When the Australasian Conference took over the  work, they reported at the first Conference that nearly £5,000 had been  raised to support foreign missions with another £1,400 raised by chil- dren to equip the missionary brig,  John Wesley .  46   The work of these mis- sions was published in the newly independent Conference’s  Missionary  Notices , and it is significant that these no longer contained news of the  colonial work of setting up settler chapels and circuits.  47   Letters from  missionaries in the field were now directed at potential labourers from  the colonial churches: ‘Are there not young men in all Australasia who  will come to the help of the Lord against the mighty?  Others will fall  unless aid is rendered ’, pleaded the Reverend J. Waterhouse on behalf of  the missionaries in Fiji.  48
 48     ‘Meeting of the Board of Missions, Pitt Street, Sydney, Oct. 12th, 1876’,  The Wesleyan  Missionary Notices … of the Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Conference , 1 January  1877, p. 89.   Letter of Reverend J. Waterhouse, dated Hobart Town, 8 June 1858,  The This was the ideal towards which the home society had aspired: the  colonial church, established by missionaries in the 1820s and 1830s,  was itself responsible for foreign missions. Australian Methodists were  encouraged by news that their efforts, including the evangelisation of  Chinese in Victoria and New South Wales, were ‘favourably noticed’ at  the London Conference of British Methodists.  49   ‘We would call upon  our friends in the Southern hemisphere to emulate the Churches in  our fatherland in the spirit of self-sacrifice with which they support  and extend their Foreign missions at the time in which they are mak- ing vigorous efforts to consolidate and promote their Home work.’  50    Foreign missions, particularly among the startlingly different cannibals  of Fiji and warriors of New Zealand  , were one of the measures by which  the Australasian Connexion demonstrated the distance it had travelled  from its own missionary origins. If the colonial mission of the Wesleyan  Methodists could be reduced to a single purpose, it was the creation of  independent churches in the colonies that had the capacity to support  foreign missions beyond their own shores. In WMMS missionary lit- erature, this appeal was given additional weight by an appeal to patri- otism and imperial duty. Nevertheless, as the clash between British and  American Methodists for control of Lower Canada indicates, this led in  some cases to conflicts more characteristic of tussles between colonists  in more secular contexts.
 Colonial Missionary Society Such conflict between Christians, fuelled by competition for funding  from the state, was anathema to Congregationalists. Their own colonial  mission work followed quite a different path to that of the Methodists.  The Colonial Missionary Society was established in 1836, partly at the  instigation of Thomas Binney   (1798–1834), in order to provide insti- tutional support for Congregational clergy, churches and schools in  British colonies. The formation of the Society arose in the context of  the agitation against state endowments for churches, clergy and schools  in Britain, part of what Stoughton calls the ‘excitement of the age’.  51    This led ultimately to the disestablishment of the Church of England  in Ireland and later in Wales. It also had the effect of encouraging reli- gious emigration to colonies, which were free from what was perceived Wesleyan Missionary Notices … of the Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Conference , July  1858, p. 79.
 to be the evil of church establishments. Unfortunately, little has sur- vived of the Society’s nineteenth-century archives, including almost all  records relating to individual missionaries. This account is therefore  based largely on published accounts of the society, and formal records  of their meetings.  52
 Like the two Evangelical societies which came together to form  the Colonial and Continental Church Society   (CCCS), the Colonial  Missionary Society was formed in response to the needs of a particu- lar colony. Initially, this was French-dominated Lower Canada. On 20  December 1827, on the suggestion of the Reverend J. S. Christmas, the  minister of the American Church in Montreal, a meeting was held to  establish the Canada Education and Home Missionary Society. This  was originally an interdenominational effort made up of Presbyterians,  Baptists   and Congregationalists in the manner of the interdenomin- ational London Missionary Society.   It was intended to support colonial  missions in the same way that the LMS supported missions to the hea- then.  53   By 1832, with the city of Montreal afflicted by a major outbreak  of cholera and the Baptists and Presbyterians losing interest in its work,  the Society was in difficulties. Action by the church in Britain was  required. A series of deputations were sent to both Lower and Upper  Canada   in 1834 and there was also correspondence with churchmen  in Van Diemen’s Land   in order to achieve a more coordinated inter- national effort.
 The creation of the Colonial Missionary Society was one of the first  major successes of the Congregationalist   Union. First proposed in  1811, the Union was only established in 1831 but took some years to  be accepted. On Binney’s initiative, a general meeting of the Union  was held on 10 May 1836 which proposed the formation of ‘a Colonial  Missionary Society to establish Churches of our denomination in the  British Colonies’.  54   The first secretary was Algernon Wells  , the man to  whom Richard Brown gives the credit for saving the Congregationalist    Union and putting it on a sound economic basis.  55   One of his 52     Commonwealth Missionary Society archive, London, School of Oriental and African  Studies, London University.

 contemporaries sniffs that Wells was rather inclined to weep on public  occasions when carried away with the emotion of some cause, or if his  plans were frustrated.  56   But he was a good organiser who succeeded  in bringing together the fissiparous Congregationalists to provide the  necessary infrastructure to enable new Congregations to be planted in  the colonies. Following the establishment of the society, work began  almost immediately and the first ministers were despatched to Canada  following a service in Poultry Chapel, London, on 7 April 1837. By  degrees, the work was extended from British North America to include  Canada  , Guyana  , Jamaica  , New Zealand  , South Africa   and the United  States  . Like the LMS, the Colonial Missionary Society operated  according to the sacred ‘voluntary principle’   under which missionary  work, and indeed any church work, was to be conducted free of govern- ment financial assistance. As Donaldson demonstrates in the case of  the Reverend Richard Birt,   LMS missionary in South Africa from 1838  to 1892, these principles could make it virtually impossible to establish  a mission in the colonial frontier, especially when it was necessary to  try to build a financial support base and educational infrastructure and  sustain a mission on the basis of an impoverished and vacillating native  population.  57   In colonies of British settlement, it was rather easier to  get things going. But, in the absence of a culture of voluntary contribu- tions, colonial Congregationalism proved to be a rather fragile plant  which sought to advance the evangelical cause by cooperation with like- minded Protestants in other churches.
 Binney’s role is significant both for the establishment of the  Colonial Missionary Society and for the imperial expansion of  Congregationalism. The great work of Binney’s life was that of unify- ing the Protestant churches and challenging what he saw as the evil of  church establishment. In his lifetime he was regarded as a kind of arch- bishop of Nonconformity, ‘the most honestly popular of any metropol- itan preacher’, as he is called by his biographer, Edwin Paxton Hood.  58    Binney saw a special role for Congregationalists in bringing Christians  together for vital projects, such as the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery  Society  ;  59   he was deeply interested in emigration and the mission of 56     Stoughton,  Religion in England , p. 113.     57     M.

 Congregationalism   in the English-speaking world, visiting Canada and  the United States in 1845 and Australia   in 1857–9, and, as we have  seen, fostering the establishment of the Colonial Missionary Society.  Two of his sons emigrated to Victoria and his former assistant, the cel- ebrated preacher Llewelyn D. Bevan  , came to Melbourne to serve as  the minister of its central Congregationalist   church.  60   Binney travelled  to Australia to convalesce after an illness, and, though he did not intend  to write a book about his travels there, he did publish a record of his  correspondence with Augustus Short,   the Anglican bishop of Adelaide,  and his hopes for what he calls the ‘church of the future’.  61
 Binney’s debate with Short can be read as something of a charter of  principles for a post-establishment Protestant faith to be raised up in  the colonies. Above all, Binney preached a church that would be united  and not divided by petty religious differences: ‘Anything that leads to  united religious action – to co-operative effort, aggressive, missionary,  or whatever form it may take – anything that leads to this, among men  who, while adhering to different forms of Church organisation, are one  in faith, must be good.’  62   For Binney, the colonies provided a vision of  what such a united church of the future might be – one in which the  Church of England was ‘one denomination among many’, stripped of  all pretensions to being a national Church   which served – or rather  dominated – the nation at large.  63   Binney poured considerable scorn on  the idea of a national church for the colonies, pointing out that there  was little indication that the Presbyterians, Wesleyans, Independents  and other churches would ever abandon their independence and submit  to English bishops.  64   The colonial mind, Binney declared, was naturally  democratic and would reject any such arrangement.  65   Short, in his reply  to Binney, was inclined to demur that the leadership of bishops was not  incompatible with wise, consultative leadership, as the thirty colonial  dioceses, and the standing of the Episcopal   church in the United States,  could testify. In relation to colonial missionary societies, Binney argued  that they should be supported on two grounds: as a service to emigrants  who wished to continue to know the Church of their fathers, but also  as part of what he calls ‘the great Christian Household, with a Gospel 60     ‘Binney, Thomas (1798–1874)’,  Australian Dictionary of Biography , pp. 164–5. See  also R. Tudur Jones, ‘Binney, Thomas (1798–1874)’,  Oxford Dictionary of National  Biography .
 South Australia Congregationalists and other Nonconformists played a central role in  South Australia,   a colony which fulfilled a number of their conditions  for an ideal settlement. Unlike the other Australian colonies (with the  original exception of Western Australia), South Australia was seen to  be uniquely blessed because it had never been burdened with convict  labour. There was no established church; all religions were tolerated  there, and all its settlers were free.  68   While it was probably going too  far to call it a ‘paradise of dissent’   (the title of the major history of the  colony), Nonconformity flourished there better than anywhere else in  Australia. This was due in part to the work of the Colonial Missionary  Society, but mostly to the efforts of George Fife Angas   (1789–1879), the  Baptist merchant and philanthropist who played a leading role in the  settlement of the colony.  69
 The first official agent of the Colonial Missionary Society, the Reve- rend Thomas Quinton Stow  , was despatched to South Australia   at Angas’  expense. While not a colonial chaplain – like all Congregationalists he  refused to accept government funding for religious services – Stow was  intended to be the official face of Nonconformity in the settlement.  He was also expected to set up a financially independent church, what  Binney called ‘the dependence of religion on Christian willinghood’.  70    Nine vessels departed for South Australia in 1836 with about 500 emi- grants on board. Mr Stow and his party arrived in October 1837. Making  use of a field-officer’s marquee provided by the Colonial Missionary  Society, Stow held his first service on the river bank.  71   His initial  reports were rapturous: ‘What a land is this to which you have sent me!  The loveliness and glory of its plains and woods, its glens and hills! –  its climate also, which is salubrious and delightful!’ Other emigrants  arrived from Britain, and more from New South Wales, Van Diemen’s 66      Ibid ., p. 116.    67      Ibid ., p. 118.     68     D.

 Funding for the dissenting settlers in South Australia   and the other  work of the Colonial Missionary Society   was supported from 1840  by means of joint collections in all Congregationalist   churches in the  month of October. The proceeds from this collection were divided  between the Home Missionary Society, the Colonial Missionary Society  and the Irish Evangelical Society. From 1840 to 1878, the amount col- lected in this way was ₤40,000, although takings in any one year var- ied considerably.  75   This was roughly two-thirds of the amount that was  raised by the CCCS in the same period and reflects the small scale  of Congregationalist  -led settlements in the colonies. Not surprisingly,  in 1878, when the sum collected dropped to less than ₤700, arrange- ments for an annual collection ceased altogether. In the second half of  the nineteenth century, rather more direct methods were adopted to  bring out the trained clergy and schoolteachers required by particular  congregations.
 John Legg Poore For the Australian colonies, the chief recruiting agent was John Legg  Poore (1816–67).  76   Described by Gunson as the ‘John Wesley of  Congregationalism’ in Australia  , he took as his life’s work the develop- ment of the colonial church.  77   Poore was ordained in 1839 after studying 72     Brown,  Colonial Missions of Congregationalism , p. 69.     73     King,  Ten Decades .     74     By 1900, Methodists made up a quarter of the population of South Australia  , the highest proportion in the Empire outside of Wales. See R. B. Walker, ‘Methodism  in the “Paradise of Dissent”, 1837–1900’,  Journal of Religious History , 5 (2007),  pp. 331–47. For England and Wales, see R. B. Walker, ‘The Growth of Wesleyan  Methodism in Victorian England and Wales’,  Journal of Ecclesiastical History , 24  (1973), pp. 267–84.
 for the Congregational ministry at Yeovil Academy and Highbury  College. Binney had sparked off Poore’s interest in the Colonial  Missionary Society and it was this which brought him to Melbourne  in 1854. According to a speech which he made to the annual meeting  of the Congregational Home Missionary Society in Sydney in 1859,  Poore had lectured in England to some 50,000 people, collecting funds  and seeking ministers who might be willing to go out to the colonies.  Following recruiting drives to England in 1857, 1858 and 1863, he was  able to send out twenty-eight ministers, at a cost of £4,500, to serve  Australian congregations. Referring to his own methods in securing  suitable people for this work, he stated that: They had had to be hunted up and influenced by various motives; some by  earthly, some by heavenly; some yielded to appeals through their families or  friends, others by a desire to assist in carrying out the eternal purpose that the  world should be filled with an intelligent, civilized, and Christian race.  78
 Poore’s estimate of the overall success rate of the ministers he had  brought to the colonies is perhaps a fair reflection of the success of the  project of clerical migration generally. Of the twenty-eight ministers  who had come over, two had died, four had returned home for personal  or domestic reasons, one had returned ‘on account of his inaptness and  unfitness for service in the colonies’, and another seems to have simply  chosen to do something else.  79   This gives a failure rate of eight out of  twenty-eight or 28.5 per cent. Poore became secretary of the Colonial  Missionary Society in 1864 and was in Canada in 1865. He may have  had other imperial projects in mind because, at the time of his death in  1867, he was planning to return to England  .
 Reports of Congregational work were published from both the  LMS and the Colonial Missionary Society in the non-denominational   Evangelical Magazine    as well as colonial journals and newspapers.  80    Married to the new pattern of direct recruitment, we can see a change  in the main vehicle for publicising the work of the Society, namely,   British Missions   , one in which much greater stress was played on the  notion of an imperial destiny for the colonies enriched by the bless- ing of evangelical religion.  British Missions  was the combined report  of the three Congregationalist societies which dealt with missions to 78      The Tenth Annual Report of the Congregational Home Missionary Society, for New South  Wales, 1859–60  (Sydney: Reading and Wellbank, 1860), p. 10 ( Reports of Missionary  Societies  (n. 15 above), p. 878).
 Christians: the Home Missionary Society, the Irish Evangelical Society  and the Colonial Missionary Society.  81   In 1853, the three societies,  which shared a common board of directors, though with separate treas- urers and secretaries, met together in Poultry and Finsbury Chapels on  9, 10 and 19 May for their annual meeting.  82
 The seventeenth annual meeting of the Colonial Missionary Society,  held in the Poultry Chapel on 9 May 1852, was chaired by the Lord  Mayor, and the list of directors was headed by the names of Reverend  Thomas Binney   and Reverend J. B. Brown  . The report of the meet- ing is extremely optimistic. There was ‘devout thankfulness’ that,  over the previous two years, some ten missionaries had been sent out.  The appeals from Australia had been urgent: ‘Send us’, they say, ‘able  and energetic men – your best men, and they will soon gather around  them numerous and interesting congregations.’  84   The Committee had 81     Stoughton,  Religion in England .     82      British Missions: Comprising the 34th Annual Report of the Home Missionary Society; the 39th Annual Report of the Irish Evangelical Society; and the 17th Annual Report of the  Colonial Missionary Society  (London, 1853).
 Yet, despite Binney’s stated horror of denominational division, it  seems undeniable that the work of the Colonial Missionary Society was  intended as much to plant and extend Congregationalism in the col- onies as to support the work of the gospel. ‘If suitable ministers of our  own body are not sent, our brethren will either be absorbed by other  denominations, or, which would be infinitely worse, be corrupted by  the deteriorating influences of colonial life, and lose the power, and  perhaps the very profession of religion altogether.’  85   In statements such  as this it was openly suggested that the conditions of colonial life were  in themselves corrupting. The Congregationalists considered that they  had a special, Christian mission in relation to colonisation. The ‘British  Churches of our faith’ had an enormous responsibility: They can conceive of nothing of greater moment. The salvation of the world  depends in no small degree on the evangelization of our colonies. To what are  to be attributed the high character of the New England States of America,  and the mighty efforts that noble country is putting forth for the well-be- ing of the world, but to the piety, the learning, and the zeal of the ‘Pilgrim  Fathers’. Let such men be sent to our Australian colonies, and a mighty influ- ence will be exerted over the heathen nations in their proximity. Polynesia,  India, and China, are nearer to them than to Britain: and should that vast  island- continent be peopled and Christianized, what an impetus will be given  to the efforts put forth for the conversion of the teeming millions of those vast  empires.
 These were seen as powerful arguments. The special Australian  Fund was generously subscribed and secured £3,072, of which £300  had come from the churches of Sydney, ‘thus giving demonstrative evi- dence that the colonists are prepared to help’.  86
 Perhaps the most striking feature of the Colonial Missionary Society    mid-century is how grand is its rhetoric, and how substantial and well  funded its operations, when compared to what, in colonies such as New  South Wales, turns out to be quite a small legacy. The Congregationalists  are much the smallest of the three evangelical churches that eventually  formed the Uniting Church of Australia   and its North American equiva- lent, the United Church of Canada  . There seems a general dispropor- tion between the ambitions of the Society as expressed in its annual  reports, and the actual business of creating churches and communities  in the colonies. From the 1860s, most of the missionary societies began  to demand that the new, independent colonial churches should take on  responsibility for the extension of work among British settlers and also  missions in their region. For the Congregationalists, this included the  work of inland missions to isolated rural settlers in Australia and foreign  missions to the Society’s missions in the Pacific. In 1861, the LMS’s  ‘Juvenile Missionary Society’ changed its name to the ‘Bush Missionary  Society’   (and, in 1862, to the New South Wales Bush Missionary Society)  and declared its object to be the extension of opportunities for Christian  education.  87   This work included the establishment of Sabbath-schools  and, if there were sufficient numbers, preaching stations in the inter- ior of the colony. Following the model of travelling missionaries in the  United States, the Society had engaged a missionary to sell or give away  copies of the Bible and other books and tracts and to read the Scripture,  ‘to those who would permit him to do so’. The Congregational Church  also supported a Home Missionary Society for New South Wales, whose  original purpose was ‘introducing from England men fitted for the min- isterial work in this Colony, and also to assist in sustaining ministers  after their arrival. A third object was to send the Gospel by the best  means within their reach to the distant bush.’  88

 Montgomery came to characterise the Colonial Missionary Society  . Like  all missionary societies, the CMS had publicised its activities in a series  of journals from its foundation in 1858.  89   While never hostile to the gen- eral imperial cause, a new, more jingoist strand   of Congregationalism  comes to be reflected in the    British Missionary , which was a continuation  of the venerable non-denominational  Evangelical Magazine , founded in  1792.  90   In 1913, correspondents affirmed the value of colonial missions,  and decried the fashion for prioritising missions to non-Christians. A  Canadian settler is said to have declared: Talk of ‘missions to the heathen’: why, right here, within our own Empire,  there are people of all nationalities thrown together. Here is a nation in the  making.  91
 The same correspondent called for ministers with the spirit of the fron- tiersman about them: ‘We don’t want your weak-kneed tea-drinking  type of parson here. We want robust men, who, in greatness of heart,  will compare favourably with the Lumber Jack of the logging camp, or  the labourer in the construction gang.’  92   Stanley W. Edwards declared  that the work conducted by the Colonial Missionary Society was the  religious equivalent of Dr Barnardo’s work for young children, which  was encouraging the flow of ‘young, vigorous life’ into Greater Britain  .  Before such emigrants lost their enthusiasm for religion, he argued, the  Society had to ensure that churches were already in place to capture  their hearts and minds: ‘The work of Colonial Missions is a factor in  Empire-building. It is generating that force which will safeguard the  vigorous, independent colonial life from decay by bringing to bear upon  that life the spirit of Christ. It is an imperial task.’  93   As to the relation  between foreign and colonial missions, there was no conflict: ‘Colonial  Missions are endeavouring to keep Christian those who have come  under Christian influences, while Foreign Missions are seeking to win 89     In addition to the annual reports of the Colonial Missionary Society (1837–1955),  the Society produced the  Colonial  [ Missionary ]  Chronicle: A Quarterly Record of the  Transactions of the Colonial Missionary Society  (1858–c.1872).
 90     Like other non-denominational journals, the  Evangelical Magazine    struggled to sur- vive once the missionary societies began to produce their own journals and mar- ket them to members of their affiliated churches. It was renamed the  Evangelical  British Missionary  (1905–1909), and from 1913 to 1956 was published as the   British Missionary , with the subtitle ‘A Continuation of the Evangelical Magazine  Founded 1792’. However, the journal was now an exclusive vehicle for the British  Congregationalist Colonial Missionary Society  .
 As an imperial work, the promotion of colonial missions drew on the  iconography of imperial propaganda: illustrations depict scenes of colo- nial enterprise (breaking up the prairie with a motor plough) and scenic  grandeur (the Canadian Rockies), religious service on the  RMS Empress  of Britain , Sunday in the backblocks of New Zealand  , and a logging  camp congregation in British Columbia. Following his visit to Canada,  Daniel Burford Hooke, later Chairman of the Congregational Union  of England and Wales (1916–17), presented the colonists as heroes of a  gallant enterprise: ‘To preach the Gospel to these men is a privilege of  which one may well be proud.’  95   In the wheat-belt of Western Australia  ,  the settlers were said to be just as eager for the gospel as they were in  Canada. From remote Nungarin in the Australian outback, a young  minister reported that a settler had requested a minister and offered to  provide the musical accompaniment: ‘Is there any chance of a service  up our way? You can have the wool-shed for the meeting, and one of the  girls can play the piano.’  96
 With the outbreak of war in 1914, this missionary discourse also  served to demonstrate imperial patriotism. In a New Year’s Greeting,  John Eames wrote: ‘The sons of the Empire have proved that we have  not exaggerated the national and spiritual ties which bind them to the  Motherland. The spirit of unity and the sense of solidarity manifest in  all the Dominions and Commonwealths of the Empire bring with them  a new vision of spiritual possibilities.’  97   Congregationalists across the  empire boasted of their readiness for war: ‘No English General since  Oliver Cromwell had better material’, says the Reverend Dr Warriner  from the College at Montreal: ‘From our own church we have stripped  our Christian Endeavour Society of leaders, and nearly every unmarried  man of our choir has gone. Gone, as Cromwell said, with a conscience  in him. No conscript army can face that kind of men.’  98   In this manner,  Nonconformists freely gave their loyalty to both the Church and the  state. In the colonies, that loyalty was given to the British empire, which 94     Stanley W. Edwards, ‘The Relation of Colonial to Foreign Missions’,  British Missionary   (October 1913), p. 107.
 It was logical that Nonconformity should be extended through colonial  missionary societies into Greater Britain   just as it had forged a path to  America. However, unlike their predecessors in the New World, the  Baptists,   Methodists, Congregationalists and Quakers who headed to  British colonies in the nineteenth century did so as emigrants rather  than exiles. In both the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society and  the Colonial Church Society, colonial missions were seen as patriotic  and worthwhile. However, they also had to contend with the significant  number who regarded colonisation as, to some extent, morally com- promised because it was born out of an ambition for material prosper- ity and it was the cause of untold suffering for native people. As with  the missions conducted by Evangelical Anglicans for the Colonial and  Continental Church Society  , the most successful rhetorical strategy for  combating this burden was by linking colonial missions to the imper- ial cause. In  Chapter 1 , we considered the Anglo-Saxon vision of the  Baptist leader, John Clifford. Nevertheless, it is important to recog- nise that Clifford’s vision is a religious one; the Anglo-Saxon empire he  sees being lifted up is the empire of Christ, not of man. Clifford’s view  might be contrasted with that of his fellow Nonconformist, Thomas  Binney, for whom the colonies were also full of potential as the cruci- bles of the Church of the future, one in which the divisions between  Christians, and certainly those dividing the established Church from  Nonconformists, might wither away.
 This is the fifth and final chapter to discuss the workings of the colonial  missions of the various Christian churches which operated throughout  the British empire. In the course of this section, we have examined two  rather different types of society. The first kind was the centrally man- aged church organisation, such as the Anglican SPG and the Methodist  WMMS. Catholic missions were also centrally managed through the  joint efforts of Propaganda in Rome, the Catholic hierarchy and the  APF (the French-based missionary auxiliary). These organisations  were closely associated with their respective churches; they were gen- erally dominated by high-ranking clergy, submitted annual reports  to a central organisation which managed the colonial mission as part  of a coordinated programme of missionary, welfare, educational and  other activities that defined the church. Secondly, there were the volun- tary associations; these often included laypeople in their management;  they were independent of the churches and sometimes they worked  cooperatively to assist the activities of a number of closely related sects.  The template for voluntary associations of this kind was the London  Missionary Society  , which was originally interdenominational though  it later came to be dominated by the Congregationalists. In the course  of the nineteenth century, those colonial missionary societies which  survived tended to lose their independent character and be drawn into  the central administrative structure of their associated churches. As  we saw in  Chapter 5 , this was the fate of the two Evangelical societies  which merged to form the Anglican Colonial and Continental Church  Society (CCCS): the Newfoundland School Society and the Colonial  Church Society, as well as the Congregationalist Colonial Missionary  Society.
 We now come to the colonial missions of the Church of Scotland  and we find that they follow the pattern of English societies such as the  LMS and the CMS, though with some critical Scottish complications.
 Early in the nineteenth century, the largest Scottish colonial mission- ary society was the Glasgow Colonial Society  , a voluntary association outside the central control of the Church of Scotland. This situation  proved to be untenable, and tensions about the control of missions  were one factor which contributed to the Disruption   of 1843, during  which two-fifths of the ministers of the Church of Scotland, including  all its missionaries and most of those engaged in evangelical outreach  in poor parishes, left the established church. After the Disruption,  there were, therefore, not one, but two, ‘schemes’ (as the missionary  committees of the Scottish churches were known) for colonial mission- ary work: one supported by the established, and another by the Free  Church of Scotland  , each reporting to its own General Assembly.  1   A  third substantial colonial mission was conducted by the Presbyterian  Church in Ireland  . For the Free Church, colonial missions became an  important measure of its success and growth as an independent church,  justifying its decision to sunder the established church. As we will see in  this chapter, the struggle between free and established colonial schemes  formed part of a battle to be accepted as the legitimate spiritual vehicle  for the Scottish Reformed church overseas. Part national assertion,  part Christian mission, part aspiration for a better way of life than that  afforded by the starving and decaying hamlets of rural Scotland, the  history of the colonial mission of the Church of Scotland encapsulates  the whole story of Scottish emigration to Greater Britain  .
 Antecedents In the earliest Scottish efforts at colonisation, religion was no more sig- nificant than for the English colonists who preceded them to the New  World by a century or so.  2   Religion has traditionally been seen as a  primary motivation for many of the colonial settlements established by  English Puritans   in the seventeenth century, including those at New  Plymouth, Salem, Connecticut and Rhode Island, and the island of  Santa Katalina (Providence), off South America. But, prior to the  British Union, Scottish Covenanters  , though locked equally in religious  antagonism with an established church, seem to have been less inclined  to flee British shores in pursuit of religious freedom.  3
 1     It is possible that colonial schemes were also supported by the smaller Scottish churches,  for example Ebenezer Erskine’s Secession Church (1733) or Thomas Gillespie’s Relief  Church (1761) and their later unions, but I have not found records relating to this. The  Scottish Episcopal   Church was originally included in the SSPCK; it was instrumental  in the formation of the American Episcopal   Church and occasionally cooperated with  the SPG. See Pascoe,  Two Hundred Years of the SPG , pp. 312–13 and 350–1.
 It is worth pausing to say something more about the nature of the  Scottish contribution to empire  . Like Ireland, in the early modern era  Scotland was perennially associated in the English imagination with  rebellion and religious radicalism whether by Catholic Jacobites or  Protestant Reformers. With the passage of the Act of Union in 1707,  the invention of Britishness, as Linda Colley   has argued, was achieved 4     Peter Watson to John Watson, New Perth, 20 August 1684, in  ibid ., p. 248.     5     James Johnstone to John Johnstone, East Jersey, 12 December 1684, in  ibid ., p. 244.     6     Richards,  Britannia’s Children , p. 104.
 partly by Scottish collusion in the ‘British’ overseas empire – an empire  that they played a large part in creating.  7   Scottish identity was not extin- guished by the creation of the United Kingdom, but continued as a  national sub-theme, particularly through the ministry of the Church of  Scotland. Nevertheless, there were limits to the expression of Scottish  religious and civic nationalism. The Union recognised the Church of  Scotland as the established religion in Scotland, but Westminster subse- quently did little to ensure that the national religion of Scotland – along  with that of England – was exported to places of British settlement  overseas. In Scotland itself, traditional communities and their way of  life were threatened by the remorseless forces of agrarian reform, the  Anglicisation of schooling, and British commercial hegemony.
 This cohesive ethno-religious narrative was possible partly because,  as a religious community, the Scots were relatively homogeneous when  compared with other peoples of Great Britain and Ireland. Indeed,  following the parliamentary union of 1707, the established Church of  Scotland was one of the few institutions that remained intact to carry  the burden of Scottish national identity. According to the 1851 reli- gious census, over 85 per cent of church attendees in Scotland were  Presbyterians.  11   However, partly because it had been spared the divisions  in the Church of England that gave rise to the separate Nonconformist  and Methodist traditions, the Church of Scotland carried unresolved  tensions, particularly over lay patronage, which would eventually  break out at the time of the Disruption and make a major impact on  Presbyterian churches in the colonies. In addition, when considering  the Presbyterian tradition in the empire as a whole, it is important  to recognise that Presbyterianism, like Episcopalianism, had adher- ents throughout the United Kingdom. While British Presbyterianism  was heavily influenced by Scotland, Presbyterians who emigrated to  Canada, Australia  , New Zealand  , and South Africa   in the nineteenth  century, included many ‘Scotch Irish’ (Irish of Scottish descent, espe- cially from the Irish province of Ulster), as well as English Presbyterians 10     T.

 among their number. The Irish Presbyterian General Assembly sup- ported colonial missions in British North America, Australia, Van  Diemen’s Land and New Zealand, in addition to Protestant missions  in Ireland, a foreign mission in western India and missions to Jews in  Hamburg, Bonn and Damascus.  12   It is also worth recalling that the  Calvinism   of the Church of Scotland was brought to Scotland by John  Knox   (c. 1510–72) from Geneva and was part of an international move- ment. This gave the majority religion of the Scottish people a trans- national character, which stretched beyond the bounds of Scotland  and the British empire, extending and strengthening their vision of  the Christian world. Like Roman Catholics, therefore, Presbyterians  belonged to a religious empire which was not co-terminous with the  British empire.
 Society in Scotland for Propagating  Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) Scottish colonial missions began well before the tide of emigration  began emptying the highlands and distressed rural regions of Scotland,  and the evangelical revival inspired Thomas Chalmers   to take up the  mission cause.  13   Like the Church of England, the Presbyterian Church  of Scotland has a venerable society that was established to conduct mis- sionary work at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Like the SPG,  it was linked closely to the Protestant state and was sustained by aris- tocratic patronage. This was the Society in Scotland for Propagating  Christian Knowledge (SSPCK), which was incorporated by letters  patent in 1709, augmented in 1738, to serve in regions ‘where error  idolatry superstition and ignorance most abound’, a pointed reference  to the Scottish Highlands and Islands, as well as to ‘Popish and infi- del parts of the world’, which would cover everywhere else.  14   In prac- tical terms, the SSPCK functioned along similar lines to the Anglican 12     H. Newcomb, ed.,  A Cyclopedia of Missions: Containing a Comprehensive View of  Missionary Operations Throughout the World , 2nd edn (New York, 1860), p. 488. See  also J. Thompson,  Into All the World: A History of 150 Years of the Overseas Work of the  Presbyterian Church in Ireland  (Belfast, 1990).
 14     The records of the SSPCK (c.1701–1956) are held by the National Archives of  Scotland, Edinburgh. For the Society’s charter, see ‘Letters Patent, 1709’, SSPCK  Minutes of General Meetings, vol. 1 (1709–18), National Archives of Scotland, GD  95/1/1. The Society does not seem to have published a journal, and the annual ser- mons, although continuous, make surprisingly few references to missions. The main  archival records of SSPCK activities are therefore minutes of the meetings of the  Society’s directors in Edinburgh and its annual report. According to F. V. Mills, ‘The SPG and SPCK   and the colonial New England Company  , all of which  supplied funds for schools, teachers and religious literature to those  beyond the reach of the regular ministry of the Church. However, as  Mills points out, while the significance of the NEC and the SPG is  well understood, the colonial mission of the SSPCK has been relatively  neglected by scholars.  15
 The SSPCK was, initially at least, the joint creation of Scottish  Presbyterians and Episcopalians though after the Disruption it would  be associated exclusively with the established Church of Scotland.  16   It  cooperated closely with the Church of England, especially in arrange- ments for collecting funds to support the Society’s work, which were  taken up in England as well as in Scotland. In 1725, George I instituted  a royal bounty of £1,000, later increased to £2,000, which ensured  that the SSPCK had relatively generous funding by the standards of  the voluntary colonial societies considered elsewhere in this part of the  book. By 1879, the Society enjoyed a substantial regular income, based  largely on donations, bequests and investments in land, of over £5,500  per year.  17   Royal benevolence ensured the SSPCK was nourished with  a continuous supply of aristocratic patronage, and the Society’s reports  tended to be divided equally between accounts of the Society’s schools  and missions and long lists of its noble and royal benefactors. From 1833,  these were led by the young Queen Victoria, who committed herself to  make regular donations to the SSPCK from that time.  18   Celebrating  this magnanimity, the SSPCK’s Secretary, John Tawse, enthused: What, then, must the feelings of every Christian be? and how must the heart  of the poor and distant Highlander beat with gratitude and loyalty when he  knows that all ranks and orders of people, the nobles of the land, and even  Majesty itself have stretched forth their hand to aid in pouring the light of true  religion, and the blessings of education into their distant islands and seques- tered glens.  19
 Although the SSPCK’s charter gave it a mandate to conduct for- eign and colonial missions overseas, its efforts in this direction were  small and they were controversial. In the annual sermons preached in  the eighteenth century, there are few references to mission work other  than to apologise for the limited capacity of the Society to do much  along these lines. In 1755, for example, Principal William Robertson  (1721–93) of the University of Edinburgh stated that: ‘the conversion  of distant nations is not the chief care of the SSPCK.’  20   After 1732, the  General Assembly authorised a collection to be taken up to support its  Highland schools, or to help ‘subsist missionary ministers or school- masters in foreign parts of the world’, which made it possible to sup- port a mission in North America.  21   Missionaries, including the famous  David Brainerd   (1718–47), were appointed by local committees to work  among the native Americans and, occasionally, Highland emigrants.  From 1736 to 1742, the Edinburgh directors of the Society supported  a minister to Highlanders in the new colony of Georgia. Later, it also  attempted a mission to the West Indies  .  22

 religion.  24   Possibly for this reason, but also because of its association  with lairds and landlords, the SSPCK lacked the broad appeal needed  to sustain foreign or colonial mission work for the Scottish church on  the scale achieved by the SPG for the Church of England.
 The SSPCK hit further problems at the time of the Disruption (1843),  when almost the entire population of the Highlands and Islands went  over to the Free Church and withdrew their children from the schools  conducted by the SSPCK.  25   As the government gradually assumed  responsibility for basic education, the Society acquired resources which  allowed it to extend its foreign mission efforts. This proved controver- sial. In 1872, a public meeting chaired by the MP, Duncan McLaren  ,  protested against what was called ‘the systematic diverting of the funds  from educational purposes to the support of missions connected with  the Established Church’.  26   This meeting objected both to the expend- iture on foreign missions at the expense of schools in Scotland, and  the monopolisation of the SSPCK by the established Church, against  the intention of its original letters patent. By this stage, as one corres- pondent to MacPhail notes, there was an expanding gap between the  established and the Free Church of Scotland in relation to missions and  other philanthropic work.  27
 At the end of the eighteenth century, the modern Scottish mission- ary movement was ignited, largely, as I have already mentioned, on the  model of the lay-dominated London Missionary Society   (1795). Besides  enthusiastically supporting the LMS with men and funds, dozens of  city-based mission societies sprang up in cities and towns through- out Scotland. Presbyterian efforts were encouraged after 1796 when  the General Assembly gave its approval to their work.  28   While many of  these Scottish societies were ‘auxiliaries’ – that is, their function was the 24     For analysis of this debate, see Cowper,  SSPCK Schoolmasters ; L.

Erlank, ‘“Civilizing the African”: The Scottish Mission to the Xhosa’, raising of funds rather than the training and despatch of missionaries on  their own behalf – the larger societies, notably the Glasgow Missionary  Society, and the Edinburgh Missionary Society (both formed in 1796),  also sent out mission personnel and conducted independent missions.
 As in England, evangelicals in Scotland were seized with a passion  for missionary work and for the reform, civilisation, moral cleansing  and conversion of the world. This involved much more than simply  missions to the heathen. The  Scottish Missionary Register ,   the organ of  the Scottish Missionary Society (1818) and the Scottish equivalent to  the  Missionary Register , included notices on foreign and colonial mis- sions from Persia to South Africa  , as well as ‘British missions’, that  is, missions within Britain rather than overseas. The latter included  the Edinburgh Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in  Ireland, the Jews’ Society, and the London City Mission, as well as the  various colonial missionary societies considered in this book.  29   As in  England, foreign missions, particularly to India, initially attracted the  greatest support from the Scottish public. However, in the 1820s and  1830s, reversals by the LMS in the Pacific and the Glasgow Missionary  Society in Africa for a time had a discouraging effect on Scottish sup- port for foreign missions.
 It is in this context that Thomas Chalmers   (1780–1847), the charis- matic minister who later became the first moderator of the Free Church  of Scotland, came to articulate a wider vision that included home mis- sions and missions to colonists as part of a total reawakening of Scottish  society both at home and overseas.  30   As leader of the moderate evangel- icals in the Church of Scotland, Chalmers   sought to renew the mission  of the Church of Scotland and uplift the Scottish people both physic- ally and spiritually. Initially at least, Chalmers supported a renewal of  the missionary call of the SSPCK. On 2 June 1814, he preached the  SSPCK’s annual sermon and he used the occasion to denounce the  collapse of moral and financial support for Scottish missionary efforts.  Preaching to the text: ‘And Nathaniel said unto him, Can there be  any good thing come out of Nazareth?’ (John 1: 46), he referred to the in  Christian Missions and the Enlightenment , ed. B.

 Glasgow Colonial Society, 1825–41
 The Society for Promoting the Religious Interests of Scottish Settlers in  British North America, better known as the Glasgow Colonial Society,  was formed in 1825.  32   It was a voluntary missionary society with the  distinctive purpose of providing clergy for British colonies in North  America; it had a lay and clerical committee, published an annual  report and held an annual sermon that was its major vehicle for fund- raising and publicity.  33   The Society was formed after a meeting held in  Trades’ Hall in Glasgow to consider what might be done to meet the  needs of Scottish emigrants heading to North America. Despite heavy  Scottish emigration, especially to Upper Canada  , little had been done 31     T.

 to try to supply ministers, schoolmasters and catechists who together  would make it possible for Scottish Presbyterianism to be seeded in the  colonies. The Society had powerful supporters: the first meeting was  chaired by George Ramsay  , ninth earl of Dalhousie (1770–1838) and  Governor in Chief of Upper and Lower Canada (1820–8). A society for  promoting the more effective planting of the Presbyterian faith fitted  well with the dozens of other intellectual, cultural and religious causes  that Dalhousie came to support as governor. A soldier and aristocrat,  Dalhousie’s outlook was authoritarian but not sectarian, and he shared  the distaste of most colonists for the exclusive claims to the support of  the state that were advanced by certain Anglicans, notably bishop John  Inglis   (1777–1850) of Nova Scotia. Having endorsed the motion, ‘that  this meeting contemplates with deep interest the moral wants of the  Scottish Settlers in many parts of British North America and resolves  that a Society shall be formed in this city and neighbourhood with a view  of promoting their improvement by means of Ministers, Catechists and  School Masters to be sent to them; and by such other means as many be  found most expedient’, the Society was underway.  34
 Patronage at the right level was always important in the nineteenth  century, and missionary societies could not prosper without it. However,  the idea of creating a Scottish missionary society to work for emigrants  came not from Dalhousie but was largely the initiative of three Church  of Scotland ministers and academics: Stevenson MacGill  , Professor of  Divinity at the University of Glasgow, Dr John Scott   and the Reverend  Robert Burns   (1789–1869) of Paisley.  35   Burns, who had an appetite for  controversy, was to be the Society’s most vigorous champion. After  the Disruption, he toured the US and the North American colonies  in 1844 where he delighted in extending the Free Church schism to  the colonial presbyteries. As Secretary of the Glasgow Colonial Society  from 1825, Burns was eventually responsible for selecting and sending  out over forty missionaries to North America, as well as acting as an  advocate for the needs of the colonial church with governments and in  reports to the church’s General Assembly. He encouraged the creation  of Presbyterian colleges which would enable the colonies to create a  home-grown ministry which was sympathetic to the Free Church. This  was critical for the growth of the movement because of the decision by 34     McDougall and Moir, eds.,  Selected Correspondence of the Glasgow Colonial Society ,  p. xiv.
 most Scottish academics to remain loyal to the established Church. In  1845, on his return from an extended tour of Canada, Burns took up  an invitation to become minister to Knox Church in Toronto. On his  departure for Canada, Burns took the records of the Glasgow Colonial  Society with him, including 1,300 letters, mostly from ministers who  had been sent overseas by the Society.
 As Scottish emigration continued to rise, the Glasgow Colonial  Society met an immediate and important need and was soon inundated  with requests from sites of significant Scottish settlement in North  America seeking to secure clergy for their communities.  36   In both Nova  Scotia and New Brunswick, the Glasgow Colonial Society was a pri- mary agent in facilitating Scottish colonisation.  37   While the agents  sent out by the Society in 1835 to Black River Settlement found that  there were only twenty-eight Presbyterian families who were ‘gener- ally very indifferent about religion’,  38   other settlers were more devout  and embraced the opportunity to maintain the religious services which  were an important component of their cultural identity. The pleas from  the isolated Scottish communities in newly settled regions could be  stark: ‘In few words, our labour is immense, and we are starving and in  debt’,  39   wrote the Reverend John McLaurin on hearing the good news  of the formation of a society to promote the religious needs of Scottish  settlers in colonies. On giving thanks for the gift of Lord Dalhousie of  a complete set of the  Encyclopaedia Britannica  (which had not arrived),  John McIntyre stated that a thirst for knowledge was inherent in  Scotsmen: ‘And though we have expatriated ourselves, and are now  obscured by the interminable forests of Canada, we are still anxious to  keep the intellectual machinery in motion.’  40   The thirst was apparently  just as keen for well-educated clergy from home: ‘The want of a stated  Clergyman causes the people to embrace the opportunity of every  vagrant who chooses to address them, and they are not  infrequently  imposed upon’, wrote the Reverend Duncan Macaulay when request- ing clergy for the townships of Ireland and Inverness.

MacGregor,  A Memorial from the Committee of Missions of the  Presbyterian Church of Nova Scotia, to the Glasgow Society for Promoting the Religious  Interests of the Scottish Settlers in British North America; with Observations on the  Constitution of That Society  (Edinburgh, 1826).
 As well as performing his essential religious functions, a minister  from Scotland was a mark of prestige for new emigrants. He demon- strated that they could provide for their own cultural needs instead of  having to seek assistance from those outside their traditions. A peti- tion from the Toronto Township, Upper Canada  , stated: ‘Baptists   and  Methodists   it is true have sometimes visited us for a few Sabbaths but  even these have been the very refuse of their respective sects … We beg  leave to add respecting them, they are the best we have here.’  41   What  all these petitioners to the Glasgow Colonial Society seem to have val- ued was the capacity of ministers from home to recreate the ritual and  intellectual conditions that were the distinctive mark of Presbyterian  religious practice in Scotland. Lapses of education and cultivation from  this metropolitan benchmark were deeply felt as the badges of colonial  deprivation which might be remedied by the arrival of a properly trained  minister from Scotland. The Reverend Alexander MacNaughton wrote  with pride of the advances of his congregation in Lancaster, Upper  Canada, who had just made his appointment permanent: ‘In point of  knowledge – secular & religious, the majority of them are far below the  average of the general run of congregations at home – the natural result  of the privations which as first settlers in an unreclaimed wilderness,  they had to endure.’  42
 Above all, what was prized was true, heartfelt religion in a minister,  ‘a Scottish Missionary, not in name only, but in deed’, as one petitioner  hoping for an itinerant minister to come and work among them put  it.  43   Such clergy had the capacity to create the dense pious texture of  the Presbyterian churches at home. They could deliver lengthy, well- prepared sermons full of moral fervour, intimate knowledge of scrip- ture, and sophisticated expositions of Calvinist   theology, which were  the hallmark of the Presbyterian divine. They could supply the orderly  parishes with well-run schools, and preside at the Presbyterian funeral  with its dignified service and burial and its wild, whiskey-fuelled wake.  Most importantly, they could prepare the whole community for the  ‘communion season’ which was the crown of Presbyterian ritual life,  during which all work was suspended for up to a week. Only in regions  of dense Scottish settlement was it possible to generate the resources  needed for this tradition. The communion season   began on Thursday 41     Alan Robinet, Joseph Silverthorn, Thomas Silverthorn and five other petitioners, to  the Reverend Dr John Scott, Greenock, 16 March 1825, in  ibid ., p. 1.
 when the congregation would prepare with fasting, rest and guest  preachers, moving to ‘Men’s Day’ on Friday with the ‘Ceist’, a period  of intense self-examination. On Saturday, there was the distribution of  special tokens by the elders to those whose moral standing was suffi- cient to allow them to attend the Sunday service of the Lord’s Supper  the following day. The Sabbath was a joyful occasion with the church  decked out as if for a grand dinner. There would be psalms, hymn sing- ing, dramatic sermons and the sensational ‘fencing of the tables’, dur- ing which the unworthy would be denounced. In the hands of a skilled  and humane minister, this included not just the humiliation of recalci- trants, but also their mortification, repentance and reintegration into  the community. Having survived this, Monday was set aside for thanks- giving and recovery. As Clarke has described, the celebration of the full  Presbyterian communion season in the colonies was not restricted to  North America but was also a major achievement by the Free Church  settlers of the province of Otago on New Zealand’s   South Island.  44
 General Assembly Colonial Committee Despite the success of the Glasgow Colonial Society in providing clergy  to meet the religious needs of Scottish settlers, it did have some draw- backs. In the first place, its work was limited to British North America  at a time when there was increasing Scottish emigration to other parts  of the empire. In addition, within the General Assembly, orthodox  Presbyterians were concerned that evangelicals were working too closely  with other evangelical Protestants, notably the Methodists. They felt that  more should be done to secure patronage for the Church of Scotland,  which was felt to be its due as an established church. In 1824, concerns of  this kind had already led to the formation of a committee of the General  Assembly to undertake foreign missions independently of the work of  voluntary societies such as the Edinburgh Missionary Society and the  Glasgow Society for Foreign Missions. Missions were too important to  be left entirely in the hands of voluntary evangelical societies.
 parallels with that of his contemporary, Paul Cullen   whom we dis- cussed in  Chapter 4 . As rector of the Irish College in Rome from 1832  to 1849, Cullen also acquired considerable power over the appoint- ment of clergy to the leading colonial churches of his faith as they were  planted throughout the expanding empire. In the Church of Scotland,  all ministers were required to have a university degree in theology,  which could be acquired in Scotland from only four places: the univer- sities of Aberdeen, St Andrews, Edinburgh and Glasgow. This ensured  that senior academics were frequently consulted about colonial appoint- ments by communities in America and elsewhere looking for ministers  for their congregations.
 Within Lee’s academic and ecclesiastical circle, the colonial minis- try opened a pathway by which Scottish enlightenment, education and  moral uplift could be sent out to the empire. From Montreal, a corres- pondent wrote to Lee in 1827 expressing his regret that ‘the moral and  the Religious influence of the North part of Britain have not equal scope  and facility for diffusion in the distant parts of the Empire as those of  the Sister Country’. This, he argued, was a missed opportunity: [T]here is an intellectual and moral life which Scotland might, if her power in  that respect were duly exerted, infuse into every colony of Britain & it would  be giving to them of her abundance & would greatly increase her own intellec- tual wealth & exalt her fame. If the Government would make a suitable provi- sion for churches & schools in connection with the Church of Scotland, this  Province would be completely regenerated & attached to the Parent Country  by innumerable and powerful ties.  45
 In other words, the Church of Scotland had a patriotic duty to enhance  the cohesion and loyalty of the colonies by working more effectively  to establish the Church in the empire. This work should not be left to  a voluntary association, however worthy. In the 1830s, therefore, Lee  began to argue that the support of the Church of Scotland in the col- onies was more than a religious and patriotic mission, it was a con- stitutional obligation. These views were also supported by colonists,  such as the Montreal merchant Thomas Blackwood   (1773–1842), who  campaigned effectively for the Church of Scotland in Canada to share  in the clergy reserves on the same basis as the Church of England.  46   In  a letter to Lee, Blackwood noted that it was commonly said that ‘[t]he  conquest of the Country carried the King’s Religion with it’. On the 45     Correspondent (no signature) to John Lee, 14 December 1827, Lee Papers, National  Library of Scotland, MS 3436/270.
 contrary, Blackwood argued, there were no grounds for giving exclusive  rights to the Church of England and strong legal arguments which sup- ported the colonial rights of members of the Scottish church. He was  happy to take up Lee’s suggestions that colonists should ‘besiege His  Majesty’s Ministers with Petitions, Memorial etc.’; however, he sug- gested that this work could best be done by those closer to the seat of  Government.
 This was effectively a call to the General Assembly to take more  responsibility for the extension of the Church of Scotland in the empire.  Throughout the 1830s, the Church responded by steadily taking charge  of the missionary movement and relegating the voluntary missionary  societies, including both the Glasgow Colonial Society and the Glasgow  Missionary Society, to the sidelines. Those most affected by these moves  were evangelicals who dominated the Scottish missionary movement, just  as they did in England. In the ten years from 1833, there was increasing  conflict between moderates and evangelicals in the Church of Scotland  which threatened the ambitious missionary programme of the revital- ised church. As tensions mounted, evangelical Presbyterians sought to  secure control over the nomination of ministers in Scotland and elim- inate interventions by lay patrons (who were generally unsupportive of  evangelicals). By 1842, evangelicals had control of the General Assembly,  building on the influence they already had in the Scottish missionary  movement, and the stage was set for a dramatic denouement.
 The Disruption forms the background to the dispersal of the volun- tary societies and the incorporation of their activities by the General  Assembly. These problems would later be glossed over and, even in  1889, it was simply stated that the Glasgow Colonial Society had been  ‘amalgamated’ in 1836 with the Colonial Committee of the Church  of Scotland.  47   However, in reality, it was more of a hostile takeover.  Indeed, the Glasgow Colonial Society can count itself fortunate that  the records of its correspondence were taken to Canada where they have  been published as a significant record of the history of Scottish settle- ment in North America. Other voluntary missionary societies, such as  the Glasgow Missionary Society, have been all but forgotten.  48   But we  need to return to the colonial mission, while bearing in mind that the  same issues were being debated across the whole sphere of Presbyterian Presbyterians had received a share of the income from the reserves since 1824 but not  in proportion to their population.
 47     Any disagreement at the time is smoothed over by A. Williamson,  What Has the  Church of Scotland Done for Our Colonies?  (Edinburgh, 1889), p. 5.

 church life.  49   On the colonial front, in 1836, Lee succeeded in securing  the full backing of the General Assembly, which carried with it the dig- nity and authority of the established Church of Scotland, for the con- duct of the Church’s colonial mission. This had a number of weighty  consequences.
 The Colonial Committee immediately began operating at the high- est level of government. It opened correspondence with the Colonial  Secretary, Lord Glenelg  , on the matter of Presbyterian entitlements  relating to the Canadian clergy reserves  . This was to include a testi- monial which would assert the rights of all members of the Church of  Scotland residing in the colonies ‘to be placed on a footing of perfect  equality in all privileges, immunities, and emoluments ecclesiastical as  well as civil with the members of the Church of England and Ireland  resident there’.  51   The Colonial Committee therefore argued for the sup- port of the Church of Scotland on a different basis from that of other  voluntary colonial missionary societies, with the exception of the SPG.

 They looked to the Act of Union to support the claim of the ministers  and other members of the Church of Scotland in every colony con- quered or settled since 1706, and to favourable consideration in those  acquired before that time. It was especially galling that the proceeds of  the clergy reserves in Canada were being diverted to support Roman  Catholics as well as other Protestants. The latter are described in with- ering terms as ‘other non-descript Bodies, who, however respectable  they may be as Individuals, are not recognised by the authorities or  incorporated with the Constitutions of the Empire’.  52   Meanwhile, the  colonial Presbyterian clergy struggled on low incomes to retain their  respectability and the people were left in ‘ignorance and Heathenism  or abandoned to the perilous Ministrations of vagrant and unqualified  Teachers’.  53   In fact, the clergy reserve income proved to be a chimera.  Never popular with other churches, after a long campaign the reserves  were nationalised by the government in 1854.  54
 While the situation in Canada was uppermost in the attention of the  committee, its remit was far more extensive than the clergy reserves.  In collections throughout Scotland, its stated aim was to ‘assist in  relieving the spiritual destitution and promote the religious and moral  improvement of their Countrymen and Brethren in all parts of the hab- itable world’.  55   This proposed nothing less than the creation of a world  church, supported financially by the imperial government, but under- pinned for the first time by the General Assembly as a work of the  whole church. John Buchan  , the conservative novelist and statesman  who served as the fifteenth Governor-General of Canada (fl. 1935–40),  would later see this as the greatest achievement of the Scottish church  in relation to the empire.  56   The Colonial Scheme of the Church of  Scotland should therefore be seen as the equivalent of the creation of  the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund   for the Church of England, and, ini- tially, its aspirations were no less ambitious. One of its first steps was  to constrain the activities of the Glasgow Colonial Society  , which  was continuing to operate independently through its own auxiliaries  and contacts in the parishes and presbyteries. This was clearly awk- ward. On 15 November 1836, the Edinburgh sub-committee therefore 52     COS CC Minutes, 28 February 1837, National Library of Scotland, Dep. 1298/222,  pp. 30–1.
 submitted a report regarding a ‘plan of correspondence and co-oper- ation’ with the Glasgow Colonial Society. Attempting to mitigate the  blow, Dr Chalmers   moved that the Glasgow Colonial Society   ‘is enti- tled to the entire confidence of this Committee as a most efficient and  successful instrument for promoting the interests of religion and the  Church of Scotland in the North American Colonies’.  57   However, this  did not extend to allowing the Glasgow Society to continue appealing  for funds. Now that the General Assembly had committed itself to cen- tral fund-raising and management of the colonial church, the days of  the Glasgow Society were clearly numbered.
 Over the next ten years, the Colonial Committee gradually took over  responsibility for all matters relating to the colonial churches which  were not already covered by the committee on foreign missions. Besides  corresponding as necessary with the government and other churches,  this included the examination and despatch of suitably qualified clergy  and schoolteachers as requested by Presbyterian communities around  the world, as well as the provision of religious instructors, either min- isters or schoolmasters, on emigrant vessels.  58   In India, the General  Assembly required the Colonial Committee to extend its operation to  cover members of the Church of Scotland resident in India, a large  population including the military, civil servants, and chaplains pro- vided at the expense of the colonial administration.  59   Particular diffi- culties arose with requests for ministers who were able to preach in the  Gaelic language. In such cases, for example in response to a request  from Dalhousie in June 1830, the committee asked if they would accept  a minister who could only preach in English.  60
 All of these activities were dealt a fatal blow by the Disruption and  the tensions which preceded it. Symptomatic of the strife of these bitter  times was the resignation of Principal MacFarlan   as convenor of the  Colonial Committee in 1841 following the refusal of his own Committee  to approve a young evangelical schoolmaster called Robert Duff   for  a colonial ministry in British Guiana, a place where four ministers  had already died and in which he had heroically volunteered to serve.  Appalled at this descent into small-minded controversy, MacFarlan  grandly tendered his resignation, stating: ‘I cannot consent that any 57     COS CC Minutes, 15 November 1836, National Library of Scotland, Dep. 1298/222,  p. 20.
 While nearly the entire body of foreign missionaries, who were mostly  evangelicals, departed to join the Free Church, the colonial presby- teries were more divided. Two years after the Disruption, the Acting  Committee of the established Church reported that, despite constant  requests for ministers, due to the state of its finances, it was able to do  very little. Much committee business was expended in praising those  who had sustained their connection with the established Church and  reprimanding those who had left, particularly if they tried to continue  receiving financial benefit from the established Church.  62   In order to  try and resolve the crisis, the established Church despatched a delega- tion to North America who reported the good news that the colonial  presbyteries had not all gone the way of the Church of Scotland’s for- eign missions and crossed to the Free Church.
 Despite the difficulties, the committee continued to manage a com- plex correspondence with all parts of the empire. Few individuals  caused them as much trouble as the Reverend   John Dunmore Lang  (1799–1878), the veteran Presbyterian clergyman in the colony of New  South Wales.  63   Following the Disruption, Lang refused to go with either  the established or the Free Church, in part because no ministers would  remain in a church if this obliged them to work with him. Lang’s refusal  to accept the verdict of either the Presbytery of New South Wales, or  that of the Colonial Committee in Edinburgh prompted an extended  discussion of the nature of the relationship between the colonies and 61     D.

 62     The Presbytery of Demerara was a particular concern.     63     Baker’s biography remains authoritative, though see also the reassessment of Lang by Bridges. D. W. A.

 the General Assembly in Scotland. For the Colonial Committee, it  was clear that they had no jurisdiction over the Presbyterian churches  in the colonies. However, the Church did reserve the right to deter- mine which synods and judicatories would be recognised as church  courts in connection and communion with the Church in Scotland. By  29 June 1839, after lengthy deliberation, the Colonial Committee of the  established Church determined that it had no connection with Dr Lang  or his quarrels with other Presbyterians (and many other people) in  New South Wales.  64   In a twenty-two-page memorandum, produced in  response to a query from the Governor of New South Wales, they wear- ily attempted to resolve the mess Lang had created. The Committee  acknowledged Lang’s exertions and zeal, but regretted the violence,  abuse and intemperance of his correspondence which, they said, had  ‘wrought much evil’.  65   As with other churches, the Church of Scotland’s  Colonial Committee was well aware that it had very limited capacity  to effectively manage distant events, particularly where strong-minded  individuals secured local power. Undeterred, Lang contrived to set up  his own Australian Mission which made a direct appeal for funds from  his supporters in Glasgow.    66
 More positive news flowed from North America where the synods  were more united and prosperous and could therefore support a steady  flow of subscriptions to pay for the passage and stipend of qualified min- isters. While there were setbacks and disappointments, ten years after  the Disruption it was evident that the established Church of Scotland  was successfully continuing its expansion in the colonies. However, the  schism with the Free Church remained an open wound.
 Colonial Scheme of the Presbyterian Church  in Ireland Colonial aspirations were not confined to Presbyterians in Scotland.  From the middle of the century, the General Assembly of the  Presbyterian Church in Ireland, which was first established in 1840, also  began to take a much more focused interest in Presbyterians  overseas.  Like the Church of Scotland, the Ulster synod embraced missions and  church extension as a work of the whole church. Indeed, if anything, 64     COS Acting CC Minutes, 29 June 1839, National Library of Scotland, Dep. 1298/226,  pp. 36–77.

 the Presbyterian Church in Ireland had an even more ambitious pro- gramme of missionary activity than the Church in Scotland. While, as  is to be expected, it showed a particular concern with the specific task  of taking the Reformation to fellow Europeans, especially Catholics in  Ireland, there was also enthusiasm to fund missions to Jews, continental  Europe and the colonies, all sustained by regular collections through- out the year.  67    Table 7.1  gives some idea of the comparable success of  the different schemes of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland towards  the end of the century. This shows that foreign missions (32.6 per cent)  raised the largest collections in these years and the colonial and contin- ental mission collections trailed significantly behind those for the con- version of the Irish and soldiers. However, the commitment was there.
 A mission to the colonies was first established through a com- mittee of the Irish General Assembly in 1848. It had two long-term  secretaries, which helped its stability. Reverend William M’Clure   of  Londonderry conducted the committee’s business for twenty-five  years; the committee sent its first missionaries to North America and  responded to calls for assistance from British colonies as resources  permitted. There were also occasional visits from the colonies to plead  their case directly. In 1860, the Reverend C. G. Glass  , deputy from  the Synod of the Presbyterian Church of New Brunswick, was deputed  to come to the Irish General Assembly ‘to communicate information  as to their religious and educational wants’.  68   At the same meeting,  Mr William Loughead  , ‘from Australia’  , ‘gave cheering tidings of the  present state of religion in that great continent’.  69   This was no doubt  true. However, it should also be admitted that the proceedings of the  General Assembly went for some twenty sessions of a day each, and  colonial activities did not figure highly in the general f low of busi- ness. To try to sustain enthusiasm, in 1858, the General Assembly  urged delegates to appoint a missionary agent in every Presbytery  with responsibility for taking charge of the different collections. They  were also to promote the circulation of the  Missionary Herald  to pub- licise mission work.  70
 Colonial work for Irish Presbyterians was also linked more explicitly  to empire than was the case for the Church in Scotland. In the report 67      Minutes of the Proceedings of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland ,  vol. 2 (1851–60), p. 49.

 to the General Assembly in Belfast in June 1891, the Reverend David  Wilson   of Limerick put this most starkly: The Colonial Mission is based on the fact that as long as we are a colonizing  people we require to be a colonizing Church; for the solemn charge given us  by the Chief Shepherd is not simply to care for the ninety-and-nine within  the fold, but to search out the one that may have gone into the wilderness. Its  object is the maintenance and extension of the Kingdom of Christ all over the  Colonies of the empire.  71
 Other than the SPG, few colonial missionary societies were so clear  about the Christian objectives of colonial settlements.
 Colonial Scheme of the Free Church of Scotland In Scotland, the Disruption was seized by the Free Church as an oppor- tunity to extend and entrench dissenting Presbyterianism, free of state  control, in the colonies. Clearly, considerable planning preceded the  final breach which occurred after evangelicals had secured a majority  in the General Assembly.  72   Nevertheless, it is still astonishing that less  than a fortnight after the Free Church schism at the General Assembly,  a colonial committee for the new church was already up and running.  The first meeting of the ‘Committee of the Colonial Scheme of the  Free Church of Scotland’ was convened by David Welsh   (1793–1845)  in Edinburgh on 5 June 1843.  73   Even though he kept the position  for only a few meetings until 10 July 1843, Welsh’s leadership of the  Colonial Committee is one measure of the importance of this commit- tee to the Free Church. Welsh had been professor of church history at  the University of Edinburgh and was a leading light of the Free Church  movement.

Divorty; 1870, Reverend Peter Hope; 1878, Reverend  J. G. Mackintosh, interim; 1879, Reverend J. G. Mackintosh; and 1892, Reverend  George Milne Rae, DD.
 At its first meeting, approval was given for a new committee to con- duct the colonial scheme of the Free Church of Scotland. It consisted  of thirty-four ministers, headed by the Reverend Dr MacKellar, and  forty-three lay elders (laity), from the lawyer Henry Paul to James  Blackadder. It would appear that about half of the ministers and elders  who had belonged to the former colonial committee of the General  Assembly had crossed the line to join the Free Church. High on the  agenda of the first committee meeting was the issue of money: basic- ally, there was none. Dr Welsh therefore called on all ministers who  adhered to the Free Church to collect funds and take other measures  in order to make it possible to extend the Free Church to the colonies,  in order, as he put it, ‘to accomplish the grand object which the Church  has in view of supplying our countrymen in other lands with the means  of grace’.
 Prospects for fund-raising on behalf of the Free Church’s rapidly  expanding colonial missions were significantly improved with the  establishment of a Ladies’ Colonial Association   having for its general  object ‘the supply of the means of grace to Presbyterians in the col- onies and dependencies of Great Britain, through the agency of mis- sionaries, catechists, and teachers, under the sanction of the Colonial  Committee of the General Assembly’.  79   The sorts of work supported by  the ladies included aid for the Scottish and Irish Presbyterian  soldiers in  Gibraltar, Malta and serving with the Mediterranean fleet. The Ladies’  Colonial Association received the correspondence from the missionar- ies sent out and responded to them. In this unique case, the ‘Ladies’  of the Free Church of Scotland were not just relegated to  fund-raising  but played an important role in seeking out and giving approval to  ministers selected for particular colonial destinations. In July 1843, for  example, the minutes noted that the Ladies’ Colonial Association had  ‘unanimously resolved on recommending the Reverend Mr Wilson as  a suitable teacher in connection with the Mission at Malta’.  80   While  the qualifications of ministers were considered by the examination  committee, women   had an acknowledged position in the Free Church  colonial committee, which was recognised from the earliest meetings  of the new church, and was unprecedented. As letters from all over  the British empire streamed into the committee, the various auxiliaries  of the Ladies Committee expanded to meet particular needs. When  Miss Mure of Warriston, Edinburgh, wrote to the committee about  procuring a missionary for Australia  , the convenor advised that the  Ayrshire Ladies’ Colonial Association should try to procure an ‘efficient  Missionary’ themselves.  81   Seven years later, Miss Mure reported on the 77     FCOS CC Minutes, 5 October 1847, National Library of Scotland, Dep. 1298/260,  p. 302.

 The financial accounts and annual reports of the colonial missions  of the Free Church of Scotland are contained in two large and regu- lar published reports to the Free Church General Assembly.  83   Together  with the Free Church Colonial Committee minutes, these volumes are  the physical record of the heroic efforts taken to put the Free Church  on a sound financial basis, thereby proving that the decision to break  the chains of establishment had not been in vain, at who knows what  personal cost to individuals and families. It is evident that, by 1845, the  Free Church was already adapting well to the new, voluntary regime  .  The colonial scheme was an integral part of this expanding work. There  is an almost  obsessive focus on finances evident in the reports, with  their constant exhortations to more vigorous fund-raising and long and  elaborate financial statements of what had been achieved. In 1845, the  General Assembly implored collectors to note ‘how far her efforts and  contributions have fallen short of what she owes to the cause of her  blessed Redeemer’, urging all to more strenuous efforts.  84   The key to 82      Ibid ., p. 422.     83     Free Church of Scotland,  The Home and Foreign Missionary Record for the Free Church of Scotland  (1843–62).

 all this giving was careful planning: annual collections were arranged  for each of the five schemes of the Church, with the fourth Sabbath of  June set aside for Colonial Churches, the fourth Sabbath of August for  the Church Building Fund, the fourth Sabbath of October for the Home  Mission, the fourth Sabbath of December for the Conversion of the Jews,  and the fourth Sabbath of February for the Education Scheme. Perhaps  the most striking feature of these figures is how little difference there is  between the receipts for the various schemes, as indicated in  Table 7.2 .
 After their initial bewilderment, the colonial presbyteries became  key sites for the ongoing engagement on the issues that had led to the  Disruption. There were Free Church deputations   to the United States,  Canada and Australia   seeking support for the new church. These had  mixed success. On Prince Edward Island, the Reverend John McMillan  was encouraged by the response from two congregations, one consist- ing of Highlanders from the Isle of Skye and the other composed of  North Highlanders and Lowland Scotch: ‘It was gratifying to see these  two congregations standing up to a man at the close of my addresses  to them, respectively declaring their resolutions to take a minister from  no Church but from the Church of their fathers – the Free Church of  Scotland.’  85   Things were not so simple in Australia, where a request  from one synod to be allowed to remain in connection with both the  Free and the Established Church was rejected. John Dunmore Lang  ,  as always, proved a thorn in everyone’s side. Having set up his own  Australia Synod and subsequently rebuffed the established church’s  colonial committee, Lang now informed the colonial committee of the 85      Home and Foreign Missionary Record of the Free Church of Scotland , vol. 2 (1845),  p. 1848. Not surprisingly, the established church also claimed to be the ‘church of  our fathers’.

 Free Church of Scotland that he regarded them as ‘a rival and antagon- istic Presbyterian church’. He accordingly denounced the despatch of a  deputation from the Free Church, calling it a ‘personal insult to myself  as the senior Presbyterian minister in the Australian colonies’.  86   While  he could not prevent the arrival of the Free Church delegation, Lang  now added ‘Free Churchism’ – along with Puseyism and Romanism –  to the long list of enemy forces arrayed against him.  87   By July 1845, the  schism had been successfully imposed on most of the colonial pres- byteries and the Colonial Committee reported on moves to establish  Free Church congregations with their own ministers in India, the West  Indies  , Australia, New Zealand  , the Mediterranean and Madeira.  88
 With Burns’ departure, the Reverend John Bonar   of Renfield Street  Free Church, Glasgow, convenor of the Colonial Committee of the Free  Church of Scotland, became the leading advocate for the rapid colonial  growth of dissenting Presbyterianism.  89   In 1849, Bonar reported proudly  that teachers and ministers had been despatched throughout the year to  Australia   Felix (Gippsland, Victoria), Melbourne, the West Indies  , New  Zealand  , Nova Scotia, Newfoundland   and the Mediterranean.  90   There  is real passion in Bonar’s closing remarks that depicts Presbyterianism in  the colonies as a refuge should a future persecution drive away true reli- gion in the homeland: ‘Let every Christian Church, improve the large  and effectual door which God is now opening in the distant regions he 86     Lang to the Colonial Committee of the Free Church of Scotland, 17 April 1847, in  Lang,  Australian Mission , pp. 9 and 12.

Smith,  Our Scottish Clergy: Fifty-Two Sketches, Biographical, Theological,  and Critical, Including Clergymen of All Denominations , Second Series (Edinburgh,  1849), p. 155. Smith states that Bonar was born in Cramond and was a cousin of  the other Free Church Bonars, i.e. Andrew and Horatio, both also Free Church  ministers. He was ordained in 1826, sent from there to Aberdeen, and from thence  to Glasgow to take over from Dr Willis who had, like Burns, departed for Canada.  Bonar was a fourth-generation clergyman of the Church of Scotland.
 is peopling from the nations of the Old World!’  91   True to these convic- tions, Bonar was on hand to participate in the often emotional scenes  of departure, as, for example, when a party of Gaelic-speakers from  Skye, sponsored by the Highland and Island Emigration Society  , left  Greenock on 13 July 1852.  92   Bonar was an enthusiast for the poten- tial of colonial Presbyterianism, which he argued had something to  teach the home church. Canada, he suggested, was both beautiful and  vigorous; Australia was, if anything, an even more promising site for  the improvement of the British race. While he recognised that English  capital was one factor in both colonies’ prosperity, Bonar pointed to  the spiritual resources which were the endowment of the free Scottish  church. ‘Other bodies are strong in wealth derived from England and  in influence maintained from England; but the Presbyterian Church in  the colonies is a distinct Church.’ He looked with pride on the separate  Synods of Victoria, New South Wales and the Presbyteries of South  Australia, Auckland and Otago as independent spiritual forces, which  underpinned the future greatness of the colonies.  93
 After more than a decade of strenuous exertion, the tide in favour  of colonial missions began to turn. In 1859, the total receipts submit- ted to the Assembly still showed a respectable increase to a total of  £31,641, but the schemes of work now show the pre-eminence of for- eign missions (£19,418), chiefly in Kaffraria and India, as opposed to  Colonial (£4,487) and Jewish (£7,735) missions,  94   a difference which  was to become characteristic of Free Church collections. Colonial  work in Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, the West Indies  , the  Mediterranean, Australasia and Natal, as well as the Highlands of  Scotland, had become self-supporting, and there were resources for  other fields. As Bonar prophesied, the Free Church had triumphed  in the colonies, helped by the transfer of a good many of the Free  Church ministry who had been forced to leave the established church  in Scotland. In New Zealand  , for example, the 1858 census shows that  over twice as many of those polled identified with Presbyterian dissent  or the Free Church than with the ‘auld kirk’.  95   Like Methodism, it was  a creed that suited the colonial climate.

 Colonial Scheme of the Established Church  of Scotland The enthusiasm of Free Church agents for colonial Presbyterianism  cannot be matched from the reports of the established Church of  Scotland. The latter was hard hit by the Disruption, probably more so  than the Free Church, and took longer to recover. In 1843, the report  to the General Assembly made a brave show of a tepid demonstra- tion of colonial loyalty: ‘We have had the satisfaction of recording the   testimony of not a few of the Colonial clergy in behalf of our venerable  Church, and their firm adherence to her in her hour of trial.’ But per- haps it would be more truthful to say that the colonists were generally  appalled at the Disruption. The Canadian Synod prayed for an end to  the division, and predicted ‘fearful consequences’ if it continued: ‘Every  preacher who comes from Scotland will carry with him the elements of  contention.’  96   There is a rather sad letter written to the convenor of the  Colonial Committee from the Reverend Alex McGillivray in Pictou,  Nova Scotia, who had been abandoned by all his clerical colleagues: Rev. Sir, You are of course aware that I am the only ordained clergyman in con- nection with the Church of Scotland now in this large and populous county.  Before the late secession the presbytery of Pictou consisted of eight ministers.  Of these six have gone home with the view of lending a hand in repairing the  breaches made in our Zion in their native land; and one considered it his duty  to join the Free Church.  97
 In New South Wales, the Presbyterian ministry decided to throw in  their lot with the colony rather than return to Scotland. This involved  negotiations with the redoutable J. D. Lang  , the leading Presbyterian  minister in the colony of New South Wales.  98   Lang had secured the  passage of twelve ministers for the Australian colonies by applying dir- ectly to the colonial committee of the Church of Scotland. After the  Disruption, ministers who found themselves in disagreement with Lang  were presented with an invidious choice: they might continue in their  chosen clerical profession by converting to the Church of England and  submitting to episcopal ordination; they could make common cause  with Free Churchers and face almost certain financial ruin, or they  might join another Protestant church which lacked the social prestige  and educational standards required of the Presbyterian ministry. Most  chose the first option. Lang called those who bowed to the episcopate 96     Church of Scotland,  The Home and Foreign  [ Missionary ]  Record of the Church of Scotland   (1842), vol. 2, p. 1243.
 In the colonies, the issue of state support for colonial Presbyterians  remained contentious. As the final decision was being made to secu- larise the clergy reserves  , the Colonial Committee made a last ditch  attempt to secure something by sending a deputation to London.  Despite this effort, the bill was passed leading to the practical disestab- lishment of both the Episcopal and Presbyterian Churches in Canada,  while leaving Catholic endowments in Lower Canada untouched.  100    There was more progress to report on other fronts, such as the outfit  and passage money to six ministers for North America, two of whom  had knowledge of Gaelic. The report to the Assembly concludes opti- mistically: ‘A spirit of missionary enterprise has been awakened in  our land, and we are delighted to find that ministers and preachers  are more alive, than formerly, to the duty of carrying the glad tidings  of salvation to every corner of the globe; especially to our brethren  in the Colonies, so destitute of the means of grace.’  101   The colonial  churches were able to send funds for passage and outfit of ministers,  but it was alarming that receipts were falling and the total income of  the  committee was only £3,535.

 By the 1860s, recovery in the established Church was well under- way – though there were no signs of reunification with the Free Church.  In a tragic waste of resources, both churches continued to support  rival schemes for India Missions, Home Missions, Colonial Missions  and for the Conversion of the Jews. Along with these committees,  the Colonial Committee submitted a full and careful report to each  General Assembly.  102   Annual receipts to the Colonial Scheme of the  established Church rose to a peak in 1880 and then slowly began to fall,  as indicated in  Table 7.3 . This was not necessarily a bad sign, but an  indication of the increasing independence of the colonial synods which  no longer needed support from home to maintain their ministers and  build their churches  .
 1880s: Britishness v. Scottishness Whatever their differences, all the Scottish colonial missionary societies,  whether voluntary or part of the Church structure, free or established,  were practical organisations. Their effective organisations ensured that  funds flowed. The evidence of their annual reports and sermons and  committee meetings suggests that they felt no need to deviate from  their central purpose: raising funds, choosing ministers, keeping the  Presbyterian churches in the colonies in touch with the home trad- ition and encouraging self-sufficiency. This was all accomplished with  a minimum of the promotional strategies which were a feature of the  other colonial missionary societies. However, the ardour of Scottish  patriotism simmered below the surface and occasionally came to the  fore. In his brief survey of the Scottish colonial missionary movement,  Williamson wrote approvingly of the links which the new Canadian  churches continued to maintain with the land of their founders: Wherever Scottish families settled, the ordinances of religion were established,  and provision made for the education of youth. Innumerable names of stations  planted by these colonists could be given – many of them bearing old familiar  names of glens and hills and rivers, towns and farm-steadings ‘at home’ – all  bearing evidence of the affection entertained by the exiles for that dear land  from which they had gone forth.  103
 In 1878, Dr M’Gibbon wrote from New South Wales to plead for a  continued flow of ministers from Scotland: ‘I trust that there is hope of  some of the  true  yet expected from you coming soon.’  104   This respect for 102      Reports on the Schemes of the Church of Scotland  (1868), p. 200.     103     Williamson,  What Has the Church of Scotland Done for Our Colonies? , p. 7.     104      Reports on the Schemes of the Church of Scotland  (1878), p. 235.
 Yet the appeal to Scotland was also limited. By the turn of the cen- tury, the reports of the Colonial Scheme of the Church of Scotland  had shifted their focus from the successful independent settler soci- eties which had occupied it in the 1860s. Its reports to the General  Assembly provide accounts of work among soldiers in India, or con- tinental work such as provision of chaplaincy services at the Paris  World Exhibition (1889), or other equally remote, marginal and  challenging locations. In contrast with the Church of England, the  colonial churches achieved independence from the home church rap- idly and without undue complications. Nevertheless, it was not until  1901 that the suggestion was made that the Presbyterian churches ‘at  home’ should send out delegates to the Assemblies of the Churches  in the Colonies.  105   It is final testimony to the conservatism of the  General Assembly and its administrators that it took more than a  hundred years before the Colonial Committee felt it had outlived  its usefulness. This did not happen until 1964, when the Colonial  and Continental Committee was incorporated into a single Overseas  Council which took over the activities of all the committees which  had formerly been engaged in foreign missions, the conversion of the  Jews and other schemes.  106   Adopting the motto ‘The Mission is One’,  the reluctance of the old committees to accept the new arrangement is  perhaps hinted at in the report of the former Colonial and Continental  Committee, which asserted: ‘Within the Overseas Council the work  done so faithfully and effectively by the Colonial and Continental  Committee for well over a century has during the year been assidu- ously continued.’  107
 While the Colonial Schemes of the Church of Scotland were always  practical rather than ideological in their outlook, its activities were  open to imperial interpretation in the right hands. No one was better  qualified for this task than John Buchan  , the Scottish statesman and  novelist, who in 1934, while serving as Lord High Commissioner to the  General Assembly (1933–4), was invited to present a centenary address  on the Colonial Scheme of the Church of Scotland. For Buchan, the  Colonial Scheme was a ‘great work’, but one which was not strictly 105      Ibid ., p. 335.     106     Church of Scotland, ‘Report of the Overseas Council for 1964’, in  The Church of Scotland Reports to the General Assembly  (Edinburgh, 1965), pp. 365–427.     107      Ibid ., p. 392.
 missionary since it was directed not at ‘ignorance and savagery’, but at  ‘our own people’.  108   Nevertheless, he argued that, because of its gospel- based simplicity, it was uniquely suited to becoming a church not just  for Scotland but for the whole world: ‘I believe that in a true sense  Presbyterianism is fitted to be a universal Church.’ It was, moreover,  a church for the empire: ‘Just as these islands of ours are a nation and  also the centre of an Empire, so our Church, specifically the Church of  Scotland has also its worldwide and Imperial aspect. For … it is at once  evangelical and catholic, historic, liberal, and free.’  109   Such a speech  would undoubtedly have pleased Buchan’s strict Free Church mother;  however, he also spoke for the Scottish diaspora who, despite the per- ennial conflict within their churches, held fast to the conviction of the  cultural value of their home institutions.
 The Scottish churches carried out effective colonial missions in the  nineteenth century that ensured that Presbyterianism had a significant  impact on most British settler colonies. In certain regions of Scottish  settlement in British North America and New Zealand  , Scottish  Presbyterianism was established as the majority church, and this influ- enced all aspects of colonial society in these places, particularly educa- tion. Religious affiliation, as measured by the imperfect gauge of census  returns, provides one way to measure the overall Scottish Presbyterian  impact in the four largest colonies of British settlement.  110   In 1841, before  depopulation began, the Scots made up 9.8 per cent of the population  of Great Britain and Ireland. Reflecting high levels of Scottish imperial  emigration throughout the nineteenth century, by 1901, Presbyterians    made up more than 15 per cent of the settled population in Canada, 23  per cent in New Zealand, and 11 per cent in Australia  . Only in Cape  Colony  , where the Dutch Reformed Church was congenial to many  Scottish Calvinists, does the percentage of Presbyterians at the end  of the century (1898) appear to be less than in Britain, namely, 4.26  per cent. Nevertheless, the achievement of the Scottish churches in the  British empire was less distinguished than might have been expected  from its status as one of only two established churches in the United  Kingdom. In the 1830s, church leaders in Scotland aspired to establish  Scottish Presbyterianism in the empire on a par with the Church of  England. What happened to this aspiration?

 The Colonial Committee of the General Assembly of the Church of  Scotland was committed to this end. However, the colonial Presbyterian  churches that were planted with such meticulous care and expense in  the course of the next century differed in a number of critical ways  from the Church of Scotland at home. The most important difference  stemmed from the influence of evangelical Presbyterianism. While this  colonial development may have happened anyway – evangelicalism was  also an important strand of colonial Anglicanism – evangelicalism was  given a significant boost by the Disruption. The schism in the Scottish  church ensured that there was a pool of evangelical ministers keen to  emigrate and pursue their vocation overseas just at the time when the  whole Scottish population was seized with the fever for emigration. In  the main, it was the Free Church movement – that is, those Presbyterians  most closely allied with other evangelicals – who chose to emigrate and  support the colonial mission cause. The Free Church accordingly left  a strong imprint on colonial Presbyterianism and encouraged many to  form close bonds with like-minded evangelicals.
 Division at home, coupled with the economic success of Scottish  emigrants, also hastened the independence of the colonial churches.  Canadian federation, which began on 1 July 1867, was followed by  Presbyterian federation in 1875, when four branches of Presbyterianism  rejoined to form the Presbyterian Church in Canada. In British North  America, there was a premium attached to Christian union which  was not matched for some time by the home church which continued  to be burdened with a complex constitutional legacy linking it to the  state. In Scotland, the Free Church was not reunited with the Church  of Scotland until 1929. However, following the secularisation of the  Canadian clergy reserves in 1854, this impediment did not apply in the  colonies where there was effectively no colonial church establishment  from this date. This made links between the various British Protestant  churches much less acrimonious. These links would eventually lead  to successful unions of diverse groups of Presbyterians  , Methodists    and Congregationalists  , first in Canada in 1925 and later in Australia    in 1977. The tendency for all the churches involved in the ecumen- ical movement was to stress their evangelical inheritance, which they  shared with the United States, and to pay less heed to their Scottish,  British or other national origins. The wish to create an imperial  Presbyterianism to rival Anglicanism seems to have evaporated at the  time of the Disruption.
 Thirdly, there is the possibility that emigration was itself a spur to  detachment from traditional religion. In his discussion of religion and  immigrants   to Australia   and New Zealand  , Jackson notes that few emigrants had strong religious views, an informed opinion reinforced  by Patrick O’Farrell   in his study of Irish emigrants to Australia.  111    Instead, it was small groups of devotees, or clerical professionals, that  were most likely to retain and demand high levels of religious con- formity. Such groups included the strict Calvinists   who emigrated  to Waipu, north of Auckland in New Zealand, from Cape Breton,  Nova Scotia  , with Norman McLeod   (1780–1866) in 1843.  112   Others  had gone first to Nova Scotia   attempting to find land that was suit- able for the settlement of their entire community. However, having  left their country to keep their people together and sustain their dis- tinctive reformed religious traditions, the ultimate fate of the Scottish  churches in most British colonies was to merge with other evangel- ical Protestants to form new national, united or ‘uniting’ churches.  Presbyterian colonists, both women and men, had already voted  with their feet when they left the United Kingdom; most were free   churchers. Their new churches remained Scottish in aspiration and  tradition, but had no formal association with the British state and the  Scottish nation. They called themselves Presbyterians, not members  of the Church of Scotland, which retained resonances of aristocratic  and royal patronage, conflict with the state and theological contro- versy. In the colonies, the ecumenical and democratic churches which  Scottish emigrants helped to create reflected the Christian consensus  that I suggested in the first chapter made up the religious character of  Greater Britain  .
 This section has now surveyed all the colonial missionary societies  associated with the major churches of Great Britain in the nineteenth  century. This movement required organisation, commitment and funds  from all the home churches. But its key moveable component was what  would later be called human capital – trained clergy with the capacity  to reproduce the rituals, traditions and culture of their churches in  new lands. So many were despatched that they came to form a special  professional cadre – the colonial clergy  . The next section of the book  will examine the emigration and training of colonial clergy in colleges  established for this purpose by the Anglicans and Catholics.

 Part III By the middle of the nineteenth century, thanks in part to the colonial  missionary movement, the colonial churches were seen in a much more  positive light than they had been in the eighteenth. Instead of a destin- ation of last resort for those who could not find preferment at home,  the colonies were appreciated as a particular calling which would bene- fit from specialised training and, for a small number, a positive career  move. This chapter considers the response that was made to the need to  train this new class of professional men. It concentrates on the Church  of England and the legislative means that were devised to regulate the  passage of clergy in and out of the United Kingdom. It also looks at the  Colonial Missionary College movement  , which grew out of the demand  for more flexible, as well as more specialised, professional training for  those going out to work overseas. A full study of the statistical profile  of the clergy of all churches in Great Britain and Ireland and the settler  colonies throughout the nineteenth century is not what is attempted (or  achieved) here. Instead, the aim is to indicate some of the major ques- tions which shaped the profession, as well as the factors which encour- aged particular individuals to try their hand overseas. The two chapters  which follow look at two special cohorts of colonial clergy, namely, the  students of St Augustine’s College, Canterbury, and the missionary   college of All Hallows, Drumcondra  , in Dublin.
 Established clergy The clergy of the established Church of England were originally the   largest and most generic of the professions.  1   As many critics of the 1     W. J. Reader,  Professional Men: The Rise of the Professional Classes in Nineteenth-Century  England  (London, 1966), p. 194. The occupations discussed by Reader include teach- ers, surveyors, solicitors, priests, physicians and surgeons, musicians, ministers of  religion, midwives, engineers (civil), dentists, commercial clerks, clergy (Church of  England), barristers, authors, artists, architects, actors and accountants. See also  A. Russell,  The Clerical Profession  (London, 1980).
 system for the training of clergy in the United Church of England and  Ireland complained in the first half of the nineteenth century, there  was no special preparation for the ordained ministry. A prospective clergy- man simply progressed from a shorter or longer spell at one of the  established universities of England and Ireland before submitting to  examination by a bishop and taking holy orders. If he could secure a  competent living, he would then move on to enjoy a life-time sinecure  with an independent income and responsibility for a parish. For those  with a degree but no living, school teaching provided an alternative  occupation to parish duties, though those with few alternatives might  turn their hand to farming or even a trade to make ends meet. As we  saw in  Chapter 2 , chaplaincy   in the military or the colonies was another  path to a professional career in the ministry for those of an adventurous  disposition and the right connections.
 Historians of the Anglican clergy have been divided on issues such  as the extent to which the clergy were typical or differed from other  Victorian professions, and whether their numbers, status and income  kept pace with the rapid changes in British society.  2   Throughout the  nineteenth century, there was a perennial concern at the quality and  numbers of those coming forward as candidates for the Anglican minis- try. However, much of the panic about the lack of clergy appears to have  been exaggerated or, at least, based in part on the reluctance to admit  men of less than middle-class standing for the appropriate training.  3   In  the early decades of the nineteenth century, there was a problem with  declining numbers, but this was addressed by ensuring that the pay- ments made to stipendiary curates was not allowed to depend entirely  on the whim of the absent rector. In fact, the number of ordinands to  the Church of England appears to have risen steadily throughout the  nineteenth century and more or less managed to keep pace with the rise  in population, itself a remarkable achievement given high levels of emi- gration.  4   As estimated by Heeney and Haig, in England and Wales the  overall number of clergy seems to have remained somewhere around 2     For review, see F.

 The pattern differed slightly for the three major groups of religious  professionals, which for convenience we will refer to as Anglican clergy,  Nonconformist ministers and Catholic priests. In the census of 1911, at  the end of the period considered by this book, there appear to have been at  least 40,000 clergy, ministers and Catholic priests in England and Wales.  Based on figures, where available, from the census, Reader suggests that  the clergy of the established Church of England enjoyed a sharp rise in  the 1840s when their numbers outpaced the general population growth,  but that they failed to do more than keep pace after this and actually fell  by 1 per cent in the first decade of the twentieth century. The number  of Nonconformist ministers of religion in the United Kingdom some- times rose above the advance of the population and sometimes remained  below it. However, they generally did rather better than the established  Church. In contrast, the number of Catholic priests generally rose in  excess of the population in England, though from an invisible base prior  to the 1850s. Making use of Reader’s data, it is also possible to suggest  that clergy of all kinds experienced a strong period of growth between the  1841 and the 1881 census, but that their growth slowed markedly in later  decades to about half that of the population. Although it is difficult to be  sure what occupiers meant when they identified themselves as ‘clergy’ or  a ‘minister’ or ‘priest’, the census also seems to suggest that the propor- tion of clergy to ministers rose markedly in the second half of the century,  from 40 per cent in 1841 to 48 per cent in 1911.
 In Ireland, the number of Catholic priests remained relatively low  until the increase of the grant to Maynooth   in 1845 made it possible  for men of modest social backgrounds to train for the priesthood. By  the 1861 census, which showed that the population was 77.7 per cent  Catholic, 12 per cent Anglican and 9 per cent Presbyterian, the ratio  between clergy and people in the Catholic church had been much  improved, and all denominations were engaged in catering to emigrant  communities. In Scotland, as we saw in  Chapter 7 , the Disruption    created intense rivalry between different branches of the Church of  Scotland and necessitated the founding of new clerical training insti- tutes outside the universities, notably New College   in Edinburgh; this  promoted the number and quality of candidates for the ministry.
 Although the absolute numbers of clergy relative to the population at  home may have remained relatively high, the same could not be said for  clerical incomes  . The most accessible figures are those for the Church  of England. While at the upper levels of ecclesiastical preferment, sal- aries and endowments for bishops and archbishops were princely, most  Anglican clergymen were not wealthy.  8   The income for a parish living Table 8.1     Number of clergy, ministers and priests in England and Wales for  census years 1841, 1881 and 1911

 6     More work is needed on the question of the size of the non-Anglican clergy in the UK  and the colonies.
 8     For a summary of data on clerical incomes,   see Cook and Stevenson,  British Historical  Facts 1760–1830 , pp. 166–7. In 1810, 1,500 resident incumbents had an income under  £150, the usual salary offered to a colonial chaplain. 2,500 curacies paid £30–40 per  annum.  Extraordinary Black Book or Corruption Unmasked  (1835) stated that, out of  total Church revenues of £9,459,565, 2 archbishops had £26,465 each and 24 bishops  had £10,174, while 4,305 incumbents, half of whom were resident in their parishes,  had £764. Annual incomes for individuals would be much less, but the archbishop of  Canterbury had £7,000 and Durham £6,000.
 Educational reform for the training of clergy was the next issue to  be addressed in the course of church reform. Correspondents to the  secular and religious press and sermon and pamphlet writers expressed  concerns about the relaxed requirements for qualification to the min- istry. ‘A clergyman’, in a published series of letters to the bishop of  Llandaff, observed that there was very little in a university education Table 8.2     Relative percentage distribution of the clerical, legal, medical  and teaching professions in the British empire, including subordinate  occupations, 1901
 For the colonial clergy, who until 1776 really meant those in America  and the West Indies  , matters were not so very different in terms of sta- tus, income and education. Since the number of overseas clergy was  relatively small, the bishop of London   was given responsibility for man- aging their affairs.  13   This included all the missionaries sent out by the  Society for the Propagation of the Gospel   who were required to wait  upon the bishop of London, their diocesan, in order to receive ‘Paternal  Benediction and Instruction’ before departing for the colonies.  14   From  the beginning of the eighteenth century, the overseas matters that came  under the eye of the bishop of London steadily increased until they  became a pressing burden.  15   Bishop Henry Compton   (1676–1713), 10     Anon [A Clergyman],  On Clerical Education: A Letter Addressed to … Edward, Lord  Bishop of Llandaff  (London, 1832), p. 7; F.

 for example, considered matters relating to chaplaincies in Fort  William, Bengal, in 1706 as well as problems with clergy in Jamaica  and subscriptions for Protestant missions and schools in Tranquebar.  Compton’s successors as bishop of London were also kept busy with  colonial clergy matters. For John Robinson   (1713–23), there was cor- respondence from chaplains appointed to the British factory in Lisbon  and about David Barry  , army chaplain in Gibraltar. Edmund Gibson    (1723–48) was consulted about baptisms and marriages overseas as well  as salaries for chaplains on military bases such as Gibraltar in Europe as  well as others in New England and the West Indies. Thomas Sherlock    (1748–61) considered the procedure for the appointment of chaplains  for the East India Company   as well as appointments of chaplains for  St Helena and Nova Scotia. Thomas Hayter (1761–2) and Richard  Osbaldeston (1762–4) seem to have been untroubled by overseas mat- ters, but Richard Terrick   (1764–77) was worried about the rights of  presentation to livings in the East Indies and appointments to English  congregations in Holland, Kronstadt, the Scilly Isles, the Gold Coast  in Africa and Fort Marlborough in Sumatra in 1770. Robert Lowth  (1777–87) was consulted about resignations and licensing of chaplains  from Constantinople to St Vincent in the West Indies.
 The logical solution to the intractable problem of managing distant  dioceses from London was that the colonies should train up their own  clergy. However, colonial colleges of higher education were few and far  between. According to denomination, these institutions were modelled  on colleges in Oxford and Cambridge, or the dissenting academies  in England, as well as the four Scottish universities.  16   For Catholic  clergy, there was the Quebec Séminaire des Missions-Étrangères,  which was re-established as Université Laval by royal charter in  1852. As noted by Thomas Clap  , fifth rector of Yale College in 1754,  most colonial colleges had been set up to supply clergy for the local  churches: ‘The original End and design of College was to Instruct,  Educate, and Train up Persons for the work of the Ministry.’  17   For this  reason they were ruled by governing bodies which were almost always  confessional in character. The business about colonial clergy being,  in a real sense, servants of the crown was dramatically proven at the  time of the revolution when colonial clergy captured by British forces 16     D. G. Reid,  Dictionary of Christianity in America  (Downers Grove, IL,  1990 ),  pp. 378–80. The affiliations of these older institutions was: Harvard (Puritan/ Congregational); William and Mary (Anglican); Yale (Congregational); Columbia  (Anglican); Brown (Baptist); and Rutgers (Dutch Reformed).
 might, like William Pierce  , be banned from their clerical ministry.  18    The first American Episcopal bishop  , Samuel Seabury  , was not conse- crated as bishop of Connecticut until 1784; until he began performing  ordinations, American candidates were required to travel to Britain  to receive holy orders.  19   Some of these difficulties were resolved by  the passing of the Ordination for Colonies Act (1819)   and later by the  Colonial Clergy Act (1874). Suspicions about both the loyalty and  theological orthodoxy of colonial clergy nevertheless remained as an  irritant to those increasing number who needed, for many reasons, to  travel throughout the British world.
 Colonial Clergy Act (1874) Despite these tensions, the Colonial Clergy Act   provided an effect- ive way to regulate clergy who had been ordained for the colonies and  now wished to return, or who had been trained overseas and aspired  to work for a church in Great Britain and Ireland. The Act required  applicants to apply for a licence to officiate from either the archbishop  of Canterbury or the archbishop of York, depending on where their pro- spective employment lay. An effective break on the number of applica- tions was provided by the need for applicants already to have an offer  of employment before applying to the relevant archbishop for a licence  under the Act. Although there was some disgruntlement about the way  in which this reflected on the standing of colonial orders, the system  seems to have worked very smoothly.

 For clergy outside the Church of England, arrangements for their  passage and return from metropole to colony were not complicated by  the heavy burden of establishment. The movement of clerical personnel  could therefore be managed centrally by the churches or by local con- gregations without the need to refer to colonial or imperial legislation.

 Nevertheless, they were also closely controlled. Catholic secular priests  were always subject to the local bishop (although they could make  appeals to higher authority or to Rome); members of religious orders  were under the direction of their provincial organisers though some,  particularly in colonial dioceses, were also subject to the guiding hand  of the local bishop. Methodists were governed by the relevant confer- ence, and Presbyterians by the local synod which was subject in turn  to the General Assembly. Nonconformists and Free Churchers were  different because they emphasised the right of congregations to vote  for their own choice of minister. This was the issue that split the estab- lished Church of Scotland at the time of the Disruption and was there- fore taken extremely seriously.
 While many clergy who made their way to the colonies were organ- ised through the colonial missionary societies, which have been consid- ered in detail in  Chapters 3  to  7 , a significant proportion (how many  it is impossible to judge) made their own arrangements with bishops  and churches. It was common for both Anglican and Catholic colonial  bishops to make use of agents in Britain who could interview prospect- ive candidates for them and arrange for their travel and outfit. While  bishops and clergy from wealthy dioceses or those with an independent  source of income were able to travel, for the majority of colonial clergy  of small means, or those who took their vows of obedience seriously,  the trip to the new world was a single, one-way journey. Only those  who became ill or otherwise got into difficulties had the opportunity  to renege on their decision to leave. A search of the relevant archival  records of the churches would therefore uncover much fascinating  detail about the arrivals and departures of the clergy of all churches  who were coming and going between Britain and the colonies through- out the nineteenth century.
 From the 1840s, while the call to foreign missions continued to have  a romantic hold on readers of missionary periodicals, desperate calls for  assistance continued to come from colonial churchmen. Typical of such  pleas was that made by the bishop of Toronto who in 1844 claimed that  the map of his diocese ‘presents an appalling degree of spiritual desti- tution’. Many people in the diocese had never seen a clergyman other  than the occasional itinerant missionary: ‘We daily meet with settlers  who tell us, in deep sorrow, that they have never heard divine service  since they came to the country.’  29   No matter how hard his clergy strug- gled, they could do nothing without considerable reinforcements. In  Canada, in the diocese of Toronto at least, it was anticipated that the  clergy for the infant church would arise from training a local ministry, 25     Comaroff  , ‘Images of Empire’, vol. 1, p. 412.     26     J.

 inured to the hard conditions and poor remuneration. There does not  seem to have been any very realistic expectation that men would make  such sacrifices for the colonial call as the cry for more clergy continued.  Responding to a report from the SPG, the  Colonial Church Chronicle   outlined the need: ‘[M]ore clergymen are required in all the Colonies,  both for the ministrations of religion among British settlers, and for the  instruction and conversion of the heathen. And while the deficiency in  the means of grace is already so great, the stream of emigration flows  on more rapidly than ever.’  30
 From the end of the eighteenth century, there were occasional efforts  to provide scholarships and bursaries for the training of clergy with a  colonial missionary calling at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.  Under the terms of the will of the Welsh jurist, Sir Leolyne Jenkins    (1625–85), two fellowships were founded at Jesus College, Oxford, for  clergy who would be ordained and go either to sea as naval chaplains or  to the colonies. Unfortunately, it proved too easy to evade these obliga- tions and it was not until 1850–2 that the first fellows, under pressure  from the bishop of London, departed for duties in Canada and South  Africa  .  31   There was also a failed scheme to set up a missionary college  on the Isle of Man, and a more successful one, Codrington College  ,  established in Barbados.  32   In the meantime, Irish, Scottish and Welsh  candidates continued to make up the bulk of the candidates presenting  themselves for colonial service with the SPG.  33   Not until the ‘hungry  1840s’ and the consequent dramatic increase in emigration, was there  a renewed sense of urgency for a college in England to train colonial  clergy.
 One of the most interesting proposals was that put forward by  the Hebrew and Syriac scholar John Rustat Crowfoot   (1817–75).  34    Crowfoot’s plea for a ‘Colonial and Missionary College at Cambridge’ 30     J. A. V., ‘Four New Bishoprics in the Colonies’,  Colonial Church Chronicle , 1 (1847),  p. 12.
 31     Pascoe,  Two Hundred Years of the SPG , pp. 840–1.     32     See Table 8.3, Anglican missionary colleges and training institutions supported by the SPG and number of students ordained, 1754–1900.     33     Pascoe,  Two Hundred Years of the SPG , p. 840.     34     J. R. Crowfoot,  Plea for a Colonial and Missionary College at Cambridge  (London, 1854).
 Outside the universities, a more immediate and thrifty solution to  the need for emigrant clergy was to be supplied by the theological   colleges dominated by Evangelicals keen to maintain the isolation and  party spirit denounced by Crowfoot. Theological colleges were estab- lished in Oxford and Cambridge in the 1870s and 1880s, sometimes  with the assistance of retired colonial bishops. In addition, some pub- lic schools adapted their curricula in order to train boys to take up  manly careers as gentleman emigrants and farmers in the colonies.  38
 While party politics may have had a salutary effect on the career  prospects of ordinands in Britain, Evangelicals were often welcomed  in colonial dioceses. The flow of candidates to staff the dioceses of  Evangelical bishops such as Bishop Frederic Barker (1854–84) in  Sydney was one of the factors that influenced the character of colo- nial Anglicanism. Of particular significance is the London College  of Divinity, founded by the wealthy Bristol clergyman, Alfred Peache  (1818–1900), which opened in 1863 and moved to Highbury in 1866,  with Thomas Boultbee (1818–84) as the first principal.  42   By the end of  the century, this college had produced several hundred alumni, includ- ing two colonial bishops, J. Taylor-Smith, bishop of Sierra Leone  , and  L. H. Gwynne, who, in 1920, became the first bishop of Egypt and the  Sudan. While no one would ever appear to have believed that there was  an excess of clerical graduates, the supply would seem to have increased  by the middle of the century. Charlotte Brontë’s   novel,  Shirley  (1849),  opens: ‘Of late years, an abundant shower of curates has fallen upon  the North of England; they lie thick upon the hills; every parish has  one or more of them.’  43   Some at least of these men were to try their  hand in the colonies.
 Somewhere below the theological colleges in educational prestige,  missionary training colleges were also a significant source of clergy for  overseas postings. While it was initially hoped that piety and enthusiasm 39     Dowland,  Nineteenth-Century Anglican Theological Training .     40      Ibid ., p. 8.     41     Church of England, Committee Appointed to Consider the Question of the Supply and Training of Candidates for the Sacred Ministry,  The Supply and Training of  Candidates for Holy Orders: Report … Presented to the Archbishop of Canterbury  (Poole,  1908), cited by Dowland,  Nineteenth-Century Anglican Theological Training , p. 215.

 The Church Missionary Society   had established a missionary college  at Islington in 1820, and by 1886 Tucker reported that it had produced  between 400 and 500 missionary graduates.  46   Initially, it was a very  modest affair and operated out of the family home of the Evangelical  patriarch, Edward Bickersteth   (1786–1850), whose son (1825–1906)  and grandson (1850–97), both also called Edward, became Anglican  bishop of Exeter and bishop of South Tokyo, respectively, creating three  generations of colonial and mission-minded churchmen. By 1825, the  college was located in a purpose-built building with accommodation  for students and a professional teaching staff.  47   A number of celebrated  bishops were trained at Islington, notably Samuel Ajayi Crowther    (c. 1807–91), bishop of the Niger Territories, who was ordained by the  bishop of London in 1843, and Samuel Gobat   (1799–1879), who trained  first at the Basler Mission, then at Islington, prior to joining the CMS.  He was later consecrated as the bishop of Jerusalem by the archbishop  of Canterbury in July 1846 at Lambeth.  48   Although bishops were a mark  of the success of a college, it remained true that the vast majority of  the Anglican episcopate at home and overseas were trained in English  universities. While they were effective as training institutions, neither  Gosport nor Islington provided missionaries for the colonies.
 Colonial theological and missionary colleges The logical solution to the problem of obtaining clergy for colonial  work was the creation of theological colleges in the colonies themselves.  However, this took a surprisingly long time to happen, largely because  of the slow development of colonial bishoprics in the case of the Church 44     Cox,  British Missionary Enterprise , p. 102.     45     R.

 of England and the lack of funds available for this purpose to the other  churches. George Berkeley   (1685–1753), the Anglo-Irish philosopher  and bishop of Cloyne, secured a charter in 1725 for St Paul’s College,  Bermuda  , which had as its aims, first, that ‘the youth of our English  Plantations might be themselves fitted for ministry’, and, secondly,  that the ‘children of savage Americans’ might be trained as missionar- ies. However, this proposal lapsed for want of funding, even though it  was generously supported by Berkeley himself.  49   There was more suc- cess with a proposal for a college in Barbados  , which was endowed by  Christopher Codrington, a soldier who bequeathed his slave  plantations  for this purpose to the SPG in 1710.  50   According to his will, Codrington  wanted to establish a college ‘for the use of the Mission in those parts  of the British dominions, which should be a nursery for the propaga- tion of the Gospel, providing a never-failing supply of  labourers in the  harvest of God’. However, it did not actually begin accepting candi- dates for ordination until 1829 when it received the support of William  Hart Coleridge, first bishop of Barbados (1824–42). Although it was  celebrated for its role in the education of the African slave people of  the West Indies  , Codrington was mostly a college for the education  of white clergy for the Church of England, and, of the 390 students  educated there from 1745 to 1900, only 39 were classed as ‘Negroes’  or ‘Coloured’.  51   Nevertheless, in terms of its pool of candidates, who  were mostly the sons of colonial settlers, it was relatively successful in  training up candidates for the Anglican ministry. Of the 390 students  who studied there, it ordained 168. While this number was exceeded by  the large American colleges, including King’s College (now Columbia  University), Moore College in Sydney and St Augustine’s in Canterbury,  these numbers put Codrington well up the list of successful colonial  training institutions for the Anglican ministry.  52
 Bishops were pivotal to the development of Anglican theological  training colleges. Energetic bishops such as Selwyn in New Zealand,  Gray in Cape Colony and Barker in Sydney tapped sources of private  philanthropy (and sometimes their own wealth) and had the backing  of the SPG, which could provide funds for colleges to train a colonial  clergy.  53   However, these colonial ventures were slow to fire, particularly 49     F. W. B. Bullock,  A History of the Training for the Ministry of the Church of England and  Wales from 1800 to 1874  (St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, 1955).
 50     Pascoe,  Two Hundred Years of the SPG , pp. 782–3.     51     See Table 8.3.     52     Ibid.     53     Pascoe,  Two Hundred Years of the SPG , pp. 774–97, provides a list of fifty-seven mis- sionary colleges and training institutes supported by the Society: North America when compared with the colleges in North America, which had rap- idly achieved standing as the main theological training schools for their  dioceses. Colleges in British North America, such as King’s College,  Windsor, in Nova Scotia and King’s College, New Brunswick, benefited  from the establishment of the Church of England and generous state  grants. Both managed to survive the crisis of 1846 when all religious  tests were abolished and government funding dried up. Elsewhere in  the colonial world, colleges struggled, even though many were far from  ambitious in their pretensions, such as the college founded by Aubrey  John Spencer  , first bishop of Newfoundland (1839–44), at St John’s in  1842,  54   or St John’s College at Waimate, founded by Bishop Selwyn of  New Zealand.  55   Decent funding was critical – as was a source of voca- tions to the ministry, a perennial complaint of colonial bishops. The  SPG committed £7,500 to Queen’s College, Newfoundland. By 1900, it  had educated 109 students, of whom 84 had been ordained, which was a  respectable outcome for the investment. Elsewhere, the colonies were lit- tered with failed collegial experiments such as St Cyprian’s Theological  College, Bloemfontein, founded in 1874 by friends of Bishop Webb and  endowed by the SPG and SPCK   with the object of training candidates  for the ministry, including both native and colonial-born, which closed  in 1883 for want of students.  56   Others limped on with the number of suc- cessful ordinands struggling to reach double figures. Colleges founded  for the training of native clergy, which were often desperately poor, did  no better. Those which attempted to mix European and native students  invariably faced low enrolments: those which aimed at a more or less  exclusively non-white clientele were generally highly successful in pro- ducing missionary agents but few ordained clergy.
 The real difficulty for colonial seminaries was their lack of endow- ments along with a continued preference for ordinands who had received  their training in Britain. It was also important not to attempt too much. In  India, Thomas Fanshaw Middleton  , first bishop of Calcutta (1814–22),  raised over £50,000 for the college that opened in 1824.  57   This was  probably the most ambitious ecclesiastical project ever attempted (eight), West Indies   and South America (three), Africa (seventeen), Australia  , New  Zealand and the Pacific (seven), Asia (twenty) and England (two). See  Table 8.3  for a  detailed summary.

 in the British empire. It was intended to train both native Indians and  ‘other Christian youth’ as preachers and schoolteachers, as well as pro- vide Indian experience for English missionaries. Nevertheless, by 1874,  it had been forced to close and its fine buildings were sold, though the  native missionary college transferred with some success to Calcutta.  58   In  contrast, the CMS colleges for native clergymen at Madras and Lahore  were more long-lived. Altogether, Bullock names twenty-five theo- logical colleges founded in British colonies for the training of European  and indigenous clergy which were established before 1875.  59
 Money, patronage and the commitment of the bishop to train clergy  locally were keys to the success of colonial theological colleges as the  case of Moore Theological College in Sydney illustrates. Moore College    is named for the colonial magistrate, Thomas Moore, who left £20,000  to the Church of England in his will when he died in 1840 specifying it  should be used for a Protestant college.  60   Bishop Broughton had gone  out to Sydney having poured a large part of his own fortune into the  endowment for the see. In aid of a theological college he received add- itional assistance from Reverend Samuel Wilson Warneford, who gave  the SPG £2,000 instructing that the interest be divided between the  bishop of Nova Scotia for the benefit of King’s College at Windsor, and  the bishop of Australia, ‘in aid of any Seminary or Institution’. From  Edward Coleridge  , his close friend, patron and correspondent, he also  received £3,000 in aid of the college project that was directed through  the SPG. Despite what looked like a propitious start, Broughton’s col- lege, St James Lyndhurst, opened in 1845 and seems to have closed  after only a year or so of operation during which the press accused  Broughton of using the college to nurture Tractarianism  .  61   Two of the  half-dozen students who enrolled departed for Rome, and the college  did not survive the ensuing uproar. Among Sydney’s Catholic clergy,  the arrivals seem to have been viewed as curiosities. A graduate of All  Hallows wrote in the alumni magazine of their arrival: In March 1848, two parsons of the Episcopalian Establishment with their fam- ilies, living in Sydney, embraced Catholicity. On yesterday morning, the Feast 58     J. W. Burgon,  Lives of Twelve Good Men , 2 vols. (London, 1888), p. 187; Pascoe,  Two  Hundred Years of the SPG , pp. 474–6 and 789–90.

 Of the two converts, T. C. Makinson and R. K. Sconce, the former  had been sent out by the SPG  . The shame felt by the SPG in this  event is mitigated by Pascoe’s history who points out (with emphasis)  that Makinson was in fact  the only case of this kind  in 150 years of the  Society’s history and also that there were dozens of cases of transfer to  the Society from both Rome and Dissent.  63
 The real end for St James lay nevertheless with Sydney’s incoming  bishop who wished to create an Anglican Evangelical theological col- lege which reflected his own churchmanship rather than resuscitate  what Broughton had left behind. Frederic Barker, an Evangelical con- secrated at Lambeth in 1854 for the diocese of Sydney, devised means  to apply the Moore bequest to establish an independent theological  college outside the newly established University of Sydney, fight- ing off the claims of St Paul’s [Anglican] College for a share in the  funds.  64   For his own diocese, Barker successfully built an independent  Evangelical college resembling in many respects Highbury College in    London.

There is also a ‘Summary of the  Missionary Roll’ on p. 847 with columns showing ‘Accessions to the Ranks of the  Clergy a) from the Church of Rome: 2 from the American Colonies, 13 Newfoundland    and Canada, 3 West Indies  , 11 Africa, 2 Australasia, 17 Asia and b) from Dissent  (98 – though probably higher)’. Reassuringly, there are only two secessions to the  Church of Rome from the SPG.
 Despite its careful programme of study – and the achievement of  a number of bishops from its ranks – the products of the Islington  College were looked down upon. In Anthony Trollope’s novel,  Rachel  Ray  (1863), the heroine says that the Evangelical clergyman, Mr Prong,  ‘had been educated at Islington, and that he sometimes forgot his “h”s’.  70    This counted for a good deal, even though the narrator tells us that  ‘Mr Prong was an energetic, severe, hardworking, and, I fear, intoler- ant young man, who bestowed very much laudable care upon his ser- mons’.  71   Indeed, for Trollope and for other anti-Evangelical adherents  of the Church of England, the strain created by the establishment of  the theological colleges and the inevitable consequence that clergymen 65     Hodge, ‘Training of Missionaries’, p. 84.     66     Boggis,  St Augustine’s College , p. 57; Hodge, ‘Training of Missionaries’.     67     C.

 Of all these ventures, only two colleges in Great Britain and Ireland  trained candidates specifically for the colonial mission: the missionary  College of St Augustine, established by the high church party of the  Church of England on the site of the ancient monastery at Canterbury  in 1848, and the Roman Catholic Missionary College of All Hallows,  Drumcondra, in Dublin, established in 1842. Although neither seems  to have ever been conscious that they were serving a similar purpose,  albeit for rival churches, their contrasting styles of education and train- ing have much to tell us about the rival missions of the Church of  England and the Catholic churches in the British world.

 The most visible sign of the revival of aspirations for the national  Church in the colonies was the creation of the Colonial Bishoprics’  Fund   in 1841.  1   With the fund in place, it was possible for the Church to  move almost immediately to the erection of a vastly expanded colonial  episcopate and escape from its dependence on the missionary societies  for personnel and policy. Cnattingius identifies the 1840s as an epoch- making period in what he calls ‘the evolution of Anglicanism into a  World Church. The heads of the Church of England had shown that, as  builders of a spiritual empire, they were worthy to take their place beside  the builders of the political empire.’  2   However, as the Evangelicals in  the Colonial Missionary Society were fond of pointing out, there was  little point in sending out bishops to colonial dioceses where there was  no church for them to administer. It was exciting to create new bishops  in unprecedented numbers for the Anglican world. The  Colonial Church  Chronicle  exulted in reporting the elaborate service held in Westminster  Abbey on 29 June 1847 for the consecration of William Tyrrell  , bishop  of Newcastle, New South Wales, Augustus Short  , bishop of Adelaide,  Charles Perry  , bishop of Melbourne, and Robert Gray  , bishop of Cape  Town.  3   Bishops, however, if they are to be effective, must have clergy,  and where were these to come from? The establishment of four new  colonial bishoprics (and many more were to follow) immediately put  considerable pressure on the available supply. It was anticipated that  between sixteen and twenty clergy were to accompany the new bishops,  who together would require £2,000 annually to support, and a further  £3,000 for ‘passage and outfit’.  4
 An immediate solution to the problem of increasing the supply of  clergy for the colonial church was provided by the founding of the 1     Cnattingius,  Bishops and Societies , pp. 204–5; France,  Oversea Episcopate ; Strong,   Anglicanism and Empire , pp. 198–221.

 missionary College of St Augustine’s. St Augustine’s has been described  as more of a ‘spiritual romance’ than a pragmatic assessment of the  needs of the Anglican colonial mission.  5   Nevertheless, it was certainly  seen as the answer to many prayers raised up by Anglican bishops in  the colonies. St Augustine’s was the logical outcome of the programme  which had been set in train by the revival of the missionary movement  within the Church of England.   The establishment of St Augustine’s  was the achievement of the same enthusiasts who rallied to endow the  Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund  . Although the SPG is sometimes given credit  for its creation, it is important to stress that St Augustine’s was created  largely through private endowments and the high church Anglican net- work, not the SPG.  6   It was this private funding and its subsequent tar- ring with the brush of Anglo-Catholicism, which was to be both the  strength and the weakness of the College.
 The driving force behind the creation of St Augustine’s was the Eton  housemaster and classicist, Edward Coleridge   (1800–83), largely it  would seem out of his immediate friendship with two men: William  Grant Broughton  , his ‘dear and revered friend’, who became first bishop  of Australia in 1836, and ‘my most dear of all dear friends’, George  Augustus Selwyn  , who set out five years after Broughton to the diocese  of New Zealand  .  7   Selwyn liked to give Broughton credit for being the  first to suggest to the bishop of London that what was needed within  the Church of England was what he called ‘an institution for rearing  up clergymen for the Colonies’.  8   However, at about the same time, the  Reverend Charles Marriott   was proposing that a missionary college for  the colonies might be established at Oxford.  9   Marriott’s suggestions  were brought forward to the Heads of Houses, but he was unable to get  a majority. At the time, Broughton declared that he was not surprised  at its failure because of the cost of the venture. It was Coleridge who  was subsequently able to get the funds together to finance an alternative  project; he was eventually to raise £30,000 which was used to create 5     A. J. Brown, ‘The Founding of St Augustine’s Missionary College: A Spiritual  Romance’ (Masters Thesis, University of London, 1970).
 a fitting headquarters for the Anglican colonial missionary movement  set in the grounds of the abbey named after the first missionary to the  English people.
 The Coleridge name was a powerful one for the Anglican estab- lishment. It was Samuel Taylor Coleridge   (1772–1834) who had given  new prestige to the idea of a national church, an idea which was at  the heart of conservative support for church projects throughout the  nineteenth century. Other members of the extended family who were  associated with St Augustine’s was the college’s first warden, William  Hart Coleridge   (1789–1849), who had been Secretary of the SPCK   and  first bishop of Barbados and the Leeward Islands (1824–42).  10   From  Baroness Burdett Coutts  , Coleridge was able to supply £2,000 for  Bishop Selwyn’s church buildings at Waimate and Auckland; Coutts  later endowed an additional £35,000 towards the newly established sees  of Adelaide and Auckland.  11   Coleridge continued to approach donors  while Broughton did his bit by writing pleading letters which Coleridge  might be able to use, calling for clergy to join him and share the mis- sionary work of the diocese: The extremity to which I am reduced through want of clergymen is truly heart- rending. The common ordinances of religion cannot be administered, and  when the outward forms of Christianity disappear in a country like this, you  may readily conceive that little of the inward spirit will be remaining … What  gives more occasion to our adversaries and increases our dismay is that other  denominations of Christians all find means of engaging men who, however  deficient in certain respects, do nevertheless the work required of them.
 Broughton’s strongest card was the rivalry of other denominations: not  just the clergy of the Roman Catholics, but dissenters and even the  representative clergy of the established Church of Scotland  , all of  whom, he alleged, were better supplied with clergy than the Church  of England: The Roman Catholics are overflowing in the number of their priests, and  many more are arriving. Last month we had an emigrant ship from Ireland; she  brought two Presbyterians. Within these last four days has come an emigrant  ship from England, but she brought no clergyman. Indeed we are altogether  paralysed. I am willing to work, and do work, I believe, harder than any curate  in the king’s dominions, but without proper instruments it is impossible to do  the work required.  12
 The proposal for St Augustine’s hit a major squall when news of the  plan reached the newspapers. It was condemned as ‘a deep-laid Jesuitical  scheme for Romanizing our Church’,  17   presumably on the ground that it  smacked too much of a Roman Catholic seminary. The major objection,  and one that was never overcome, was that a missionary training school  already existed run by the Church Missionary Society at Islington   and  any additional project was sure to draw off funds which might better be  put at the disposal of the SPG.  18   The saving of the plan was the decision  to tie the establishment of the College with the restoration of the ruins  of St Augustine’s Abbey. An article in the  English Churchman  had caught  the attention of Alexander Beresford Hope   (1820–87), who managed to  purchase the site of the former Monastery of St Augustine for £2,020.  19    Hope was a politician and writer; as a high churchman he became swept  up in the projects of the Anglican missionary revival. The College was the  most ambitious project of the colonial mission movement and accounts 13     One omission from Boggis’ list is John Henry Newman. This may be deliberate.     14     Boggis,  St Augustine’s College , p. 38.    15      Ibid ., p. 40.     16      Ibid ., p. 45.    17      Ibid ., p. 57.     18     Anon, ‘St Augustine’s, Canterbury’,  Colonial Church Chronicle , 1 (1847), p. 82.     19     Boggis,  St Augustine’s College , p. 60.
 of its much anticipated work were posted regularly in the  Colonial  Church Chronicle .  20   Hope secured the architect William Butterfield   who  embraced the project as an opportunity to rebuild the ancient monastery  of St Augustine’s. Much was anticipated of the site with all its associations  and the wish that it would become ‘the centre of the missionary opera- tions of the country – the heart from which the life of the Gospel may  flow forth to the ends of the world – on a spot hallowed by old and ven- erable recollections, in the very metropolitan city of Canterbury, and on  the site of the old Priory of St Augustine’.  21   George Frederick MacLean    (1833–1902), Warden of the College from 1880 until his death, gave lec- tures on missionary history which drew extensive parallels between the  work of the medieval missionaries and that undertaken by the current  students heading across the empire.  22

 Endowments and scholarships are another indication of the organisa- tion and individuals that fostered the closest links with St Augustine’s    and who were prepared to welcome its alumni. Donors of these included  Mrs Shephard of Tunbridge Wells, sister of Reverend Martin Routh,  President of Magdalen College, Oxford, and the SPCK  . One of the  College’s most generous individual supporters was the Reverend Henry  John Hutchesson   (1782–1863).  32   Hutchesson, who was at one time  headmaster of the King’s School at Canterbury, had been Broughton’s  mathematical tutor. He was a keen supporter of the colonial church,  and, when the chapel of St Augustine’s was consecrated, he gave £1,000  for a scholarship for an Australian student. He later endowed another  scholarship for students who had attended the Clergy Orphan School,  Canterbury or ‘any orphan son of any clergyman of the United Church  of England and Ireland, of the Episcopal Church in Scotland, or of the  Colonial Churches’.  33   Continuing the connection with the College ini- tiated by Edward Coleridge, there was another scholarship donated by  the members of Eton College. The Society for Advancing the Christian  Faith in the British West India Islands   provided assistance towards the  maintenance of ‘a young man of colour, a native of Berbice to be trained  at St Augustine’s for the ministry of the Church in British Guiana’.  34
 The alumni The ordinands who were produced by St Augustine’s can be counted  among the best-travelled clergy in history. From the first graduat- ing class in 1849, when they scattered to the dioceses of Cape Town,  Newfoundland (two), Barbados (two), Nova Scotia, Newcastle (New  South Wales) and Sydney, until 1904, 617 clergy were entered on its  roll of graduates. They went wherever colonial dioceses could pro- vide placements for them and so they followed the regions of British  settlement and colonisation. As with the missionary appointments of  the SPG, though not to the same degree, the ordinands were destined  in the largest numbers for Canada and Newfoundland (147), but they  went to Asia and India (126), Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific  (98), Africa and the Middle East (76), the West Indies and Central  and South America (23) and England and Gibraltar (10). Indeed, they  crossed the globe, heading to 82 different dioceses from Adelaide (10)  to Zululand (4). And, although 17 of them were not listed with their  ‘diocese of sailing’, almost all seem to have left Canterbury for their new  postings where many made distinguished colonial careers.
 Augustinians, J. W. Coe and W. L. Nanson, were principals of Bishop’s  College, Calcutta  , and a half-dozen others had been decorated for ser- vice as military chaplains in the Crimean and Boer Wars.  41   They were  a cohesive body – diligently returning letters to their alma mater with  accounts of their journeys to their dioceses and adventures in travelling  around remote and hostile locations, and of their achievements while  on their postings. These were republished, in the way of missionary let- ters, in the college magazine.  42   As with other missionary writings, these  include physical and spiritual adventures in equal measure: encoun- ters with the elements and with adversity, with hostile Catholics and  Dissenters, as well as indifference and anti-clericalism.
 clergy. In his analysis of the motivation of British Protestant mission- aries who were sent to India, Piggin   observes that there were sixteen  kinds of reason given by candidates who wished to undertake a mission  to the heathen: economic security, the desire for respectability, roman- tic or heroic aspirations; the honour of the missionary calling; heavenly  rewards; the cult of usefulness; educational and psychological aptitude;  imperialist impulse to civilise the heathen; pity; denominational com- petition; eschatological motives; the glory of God; duty; and, finally,  the love of Christ. Almost all of these can readily be attached to mis- sions to the colonies. But, in addition, there was the aspiration of those  who wished to ‘help our brothers and sisters’ and to contribute to the  building up of the Empire – the kinds of values reflected in the anniver- sary sermons of the various colonial missionary societies, especially the  SPG and the CCCS.
 The idea that the colonial mission was a special and particular calling  was reflected from the middle of the nineteenth century by a movement  to create colleges especially for this purpose. Nevertheless, it might also  be interpreted as part of the international flow of labour that was facili- tated by the expansion of the empire. It was also conducted on a larger  scale than foreign missions. Piggin’s study includes analysis of some  557 missionary candidates from ten societies (only a proportion of all  those who served). The field of inquiry for those seeking to study candi- dates for the colonial missions is much larger. The summary of the mis- sionary roll of the SPG devised by Pascoe indicates that almost 4,000  missionaries served with the SPG, the majority of whom were engaged  in missions to colonists, including 1,597 to Newfoundland and Canada,  446 to the West Indies and South America, 505 to Africa, and 530 to  Australasia.  47
 Since there were about 500 candidates for the colonial ministry who  graduated from St Augustine’s alone,  48   and, in the case of colonial mis- sion societies, only the SPG has retained the papers relating to candi- dates’ applications, it is evident that it will be difficult to match Piggin’s  analysis of missionary motivation and social background. However, it  is likely that the motivation of men who considered taking up a mis- sionary call to the heathen or to the colonies was very similar. In fact,  Piggin notes that Arthur Bell Nichols  , the young curate who proposed 47     Pascoe,  Two Hundred Years of the SPG , p. 847. See Table 3.2, SPG: summary of the  missionary roll, 1701–1900. Pascoe does not distinguish missionaries sent to minister  to colonists from those sent to heathen missions but the majority of SPG missions (see   Chapter 3 ) were to settlers.
 To what extent did St Augustine’s simply reinforce the colonial prej- udices of the clergy it trained, delaying the development of colonial  churches? To what extent did the ‘missionary’ standing of the college 49     Piggin,  Making Evangelical Missionaries , p. 125, citing A. B. Nicholls’ answers to  questions, 28 January 1853.

 act as a smokescreen for the other, less altruistic motives of those who  decided to train for the colonial ministry? This is hard to determine.  Certainly, the missionary vocation cultivated at St Augustine’s with its  high church patronage is something that is reflected in other imperial  projects, including the Canterbury settlement in New Zealand  , or the  Melanesian mission. It was an institution of its time – the middle decades  of the nineteenth century – which was also the most idealistic period for  Christian colonisation   with its own attendant ministry. Mission bur- saries to St Augustine’s did provide an avenue to train missionaries for  places such as New Guinea. They also helped to bring a small number  of exceptional ‘native’ Christians back to England to train at the mis- sionary college. But the colonial foundation of the college continued for  some time to leaden its prospects. The candidates had less prestige than  those who completed their education at the universities and they were  tainted by Anglo-Catholicism  . Evangelical bishops preferred to obtain  their clergy either from definitely Evangelical theological colleges or  from their own diocesan colleges where they could oversee their train- ing. Nevertheless, as a cohort of clergy who were inculcated with the  value of the colonial mission at the same time as they received their  training, the students of St Augustine’s could hardly avoid being mis- sionaries for both colonialism and Christianity.
 The link with the SPG   was not a part of the initial foundation, but,  by the 1930s, the connection had become quite close. The connection  is stressed by W. F. France, canon of Canterbury and a former Oversea  Secretary of the SPG and warden of the college, who promoted the dig- nity of the overseas episcopate and the colonial mission in his writing.  53    But it was, by this time, an increasingly defensive posture. In 1942, the  college chapel was badly damaged during the blitz and, in the absence  of a new patron, it was not possible to repair it. The decision to dis- continue the college as a missionary institution followed in 1947, and  the buildings were eventually sold to King’s School, Canterbury.    54   In  the chapter which follows, we will compare the colonial achievements  of St. Augustine’s with its closest institutional equivalent, the Catholic  missionary college of All Hallows, Drumcondra.

 10     Missionary College of All Hallows,  Drumcondra (Dublin) Clerical training in Catholic Europe was reformed in the wake of  the disastrous setbacks (or possibly ‘opportunities’) of the Protestant  Reformation. The most important initiative flowed from the Council  of Trent   (1545–65) which provided directions aimed at professionalis- ing the priesthood and providing uniform guidelines for seminaries for  priestly training and formation. Under canon 18 of the twenty-third  session of the Council, which met between 1562 and 1563, all bishops  were required to create seminaries in their dioceses which would pro- vide a course of study including grammar, humanistic studies, patris- tics and instructions in the liturgy and performance of the sacraments.  1    In reality, this was practically impossible, especially in countries such  as France where there were numerous dioceses and it was simply too  expensive to create colleges in all of them. These colleges were intended  to provide both a general education and the special theological and  liturgical training required for the priesthood. However, the most pres- tigious seminaries were those attached to the largest and wealthiest  dioceses, above all that of Rome; others were extremely poor. Bishops  retained considerable discretion on the length of training, the curric- ulum and the basis for the selection of applicants. This was retained  until 1918 when the new Code of Canon Law specified the length and  courses required for training for the priesthood and specified, for the  first time, that all priests had to be trained in a seminary.  2
 In addition to these diocesan seminaries for the training of secu- lar priests, Rome was the location for the Urban College  , founded as  a missionary seminary in the palace of the Sacred Congregation of  Propaganda, and usually referred to as the College of Propaganda Fide.  This was Paul Cullen’s   alma mater, from where he became doctor of  theology in 1828, and it was one of Rome’s most distinguished and 1     C. H. Parker,  Faith on the Margins: Catholics and Catholicism in the Dutch Golden Age   (Cambridge, MA, 2008), pp. 74–5.
 influential houses of learning. There were numerous other missionary  seminaries, many in Rome, which were established by Catholic mis- sionary orders and which served the same function.  3   These Roman col- leges trained an elite cadre who might anticipate appointment in due  course as bishops and heads of monastic houses either in their home  countries or, increasingly, in the colonies. Under Cullen, who served  as rector from 1832 to 1849, the Irish College in Rome   became the  powerhouse for the training of Irish bishops for the British empire.  4    This began under Cullen but continued after his death. In addition,  Cullenite bishops went on to found seminaries modelled on the Irish  College in their own dioceses, including Patrick Francis Moran’s semin- ary in the Sydney suburb of Manly, and St Charles Borromeo Seminary  in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, all of which extended his  influence well into and beyond the generation after his death.
 France also had a long tradition of providing college training for both  foreign and poor French students for missionary and colonial work.  5    Prior to Catholic emancipation in Britain, there were colleges in vari- ous French dioceses for English, Scottish and Irish students – especially  the latter.  6   While most trained priests for their home churches, they  also provided a steady supply of priests who were devoted – or desper- ate – enough to take on religious duties in places where no French priest  would agree to go. In Paris, the Séminaire des Missions-Etrangères    trained priests for the French empire. However, the most important mis- sionary seminary was that of the French Congrégation du Saint-Esprit  ,  also known as the Spiritans or, in Ireland, the Holy Ghost Fathers.  7   The  Order, founded in Paris in 1703, trained young men from poor back- grounds who had a vocation for the priesthood and who would accept  hardship postings to rural frontiers, or as chaplains in hospitals, prisons  and schools. Later, the order also conducted missions in North America,  Africa and the Far East. Although suppressed during the Revolution, in  1802 the French government reopened the seminary specifically to train  priests for missionary work in French colonies, including Acadie (Nova  Scotia)  , places where they undertook the care of both Europeans and 3     For a long list of these, see U. Benigni, ‘Sacred Congregation of Propaganda’, in   Catholic Encyclopedia  (New York, 1911).

 non-Europeans. This was a government  enterprise, and colonial priests  were effectively part of the colonial service, as colonial chaplains were in  the British empire. The missionaries are said to have served the govern- ment well and gained for it the affections of the native people.  8   By the  nineteenth century, training for missionaries to go out to the French- speaking colonies of the British empire was available from the Séminaire  des Missions-Etrangères (Paris),   the Séminaire de la Congrégation du  Saint-Esprit (Paris)   and some colonial diocesan seminaries, most not- ably that in Quebec. The Quebec Séminaire des Missions-Étrangères    was established in 1663 as a daughter foundation of the Paris seminary  of the same name.  9   During the English conquest (1759), it was used to  garrison troops and the seminary was closed. However, in 1852, in a  different building, it was re- established as Université Laval   with a royal  charter from Queen Victoria. By this late stage, Ireland had overtaken  France in the production of Catholic missionary clergy for the British  empire, and French colonial priests subsequently made little impact  outside North America.
 Until late in the eighteenth century, Catholic penal laws   made it neces- sary for English, Irish and Scottish students who wished to study for the  Catholic priesthood or join a religious order to study on the continent,  and their numbers were relatively small.  10   When the French Revolution  forced many of these colleges to close, there was a renewed push to  provide for clerical training in Britain. A national seminary for Ireland  was founded in 1795 at Maynooth   in County Kildare, and within a  short period many others were founded in dioceses across Ireland  . As  we have seen, in 1838, when the English mission was expanded, the  Holy See proposed that a missionary college be established, either in  England or in Ireland, in order to provide clergy for the English col- onies.  11   When the English vicars apostolic proved unable to respond to  this, it was inevitable that the papacy would give its backing to the cre- ation of a suitable institution in Ireland.

 Missionary College of All Hallows All Hallows was founded to train men for Irish colonial missions in the  British, which is to say the Irish spiritual, empire. However, compared  with St Augustine’s – let alone with Propaganda College in Rome – it  had little to recommend it in terms of teaching, facilities or prestige. Its  history is wracked with complaints about the excessive Irishness and  ignorance of its priests and student-led revolts against its Spartan living  conditions and arbitrary discipline.  12   Nevertheless, it was a spectacular  success – because it was needed. From the time of its foundation in 1842  until 1892, when the College was put into the hands of the Vincentian  Fathers  , it produced over 2,000 priests for missions to the United States,  Australia   and New Zealand  , and other settler colonies.  13   The scale of  the All Hallows venture was beyond the capacity of the College itself to  keep track of: in 1907, when contributing to the  Catholic Encyclopedia ,  14    the College claimed to have produced 1,500 priests in the previous sixty  years: Condon and the researchers who contributed to his history of the Table 10.1     Irish missionary seminaries College Date founded Date of earliest mission All Hallows College, Drumcondra 1841 1842 St Kieran’s, Kilkenny 1782 1813 St Patrick’s College, Carlow 1793 1842 Fund for Foreign Missions St Patrick’s College, Maynooth 1795 1838 India and Australia missions St John’s College, Waterford 1807 1830s Newfoundland St Peter’s College, Wexford 1819 Cape Colony, Eastern vicariate St Patrick’s College, Thurles 1838 1870s Renewed mission programme St Mary’s College, Youghal 1839–44 1839 ‘College for the Foreign Missions’ Source: Conlan,  Missionary College of All Hallows, 1842–91 , pp. 223–5.
 The migration programme of Catholic clergy to the colonies was not  exhausted by the candidates of All Hallows, any more than Anglican  clergy were by St Augustine’s. Priests found their way to the colonies Table 10.2     All Hallows College, summary of destinations of matriculants,  1842–91
 of the British empire from Ireland, France and elsewhere in Catholic  Europe, by many paths. In addition to the parochial clergy trained at All  Hallows, there were many thousands more men and women   from the  regular and some monastic orders   who emigrated after their training  in Ireland to serve as teachers, nurses and missionaries for the schools,  hospitals and other Catholic institutions of the colonies.  16   Indeed, by  the 1860s, not just All Hallows but most of the seminaries in Ireland  were supplying priests for both colonial missions and for the expand- ing Catholic dioceses of England, Wales and Scotland. One of the  most important, Carlow   College, produced over 1,000 priests for dio- ceses in England, Scotland, Australia  , Canada and other parts of the  British empire, as well as the United States.  17   However, one institution  was nothing short of a powerhouse for colonial clergy production: All  Hallows, the most remarkable single institution in the complex pattern  of the intersecting religious, commercial and emigrant imperatives that  makes up the history of the colonial missions of Greater Britain  .
 It was a thrifty, spectacularly successful, venture launched on a win- ning formula: a subscription of £10 annually was sufficient to secure a  free place for a student. This would secure not only the education of a  candidate for the priesthood but also daily mass which was offered up  for all the College’s subscribers and benefactors. Any subscriber who 16     For a very thorough (if rather bloodless) international survey, see Murphy,  History  of Irish Emigrant and Missionary Education . Also O. D.

 possibly for this reason never seems to have felt entirely warm about the  missionary seminary. But it served a clear practical need and Murray  was quick to add his approval to the project. The Dublin Committee  for the Association for the Propagation of the Faith, the lay fund-raising  organisation based in Lyons, also approved, which ensured that fund- raising could proceed through parishes for the College project.
 Hand pushed hard and began renovating the Drumcondra site when  he had collected a mere £800, trusting sufficient donations would fol- low. They did and the first intake of students was in November 1842.  This included thirty-eight candidates destined for the missions of  Vincennes and New York (United States), British Guiana, Trinidad,  Scotland, Calcutta, Agra, Madras, the Cape of Good Hope and Sydney  (Australia)  . From the beginning the College made no real distinction  between work directed at the conversion of the heathen and that among  Europeans already converted. Rather, the College provided missionar- ies who could be sent to all the British colonies and territories as well as  the United States: everywhere the Irish diaspora had dispersed, lending  their colonising backs and arms to the empire. The religious need was  evident to the College: ‘The spiritual destitution of these vast regions  is extreme and most appalling. Truly, in these missions there are mil- lions of the children of our Heavenly Father, “who cry out for bread,  and there is no one to break it to them: the harvest is indeed great, but  the labourers are few”.’  22   This was the religious vocation to which All  Hallows’ men were called; however, it was also a way to earn a living in  an honourable profession and to secure a passage to the colonies.

The vicar apostolic wrote: I know that the Government has concocted a plan to suppress all the Regimental  Schools of these provinces, and to send all the Catholic children of the soldiers  to the Protestant Asylum. I am endeavouring with all my strength to oppose  such an attempt against our holy religion, and especially to protect the poor  orphans of the deceased soldiers of the army of the Sutledje; but I cannot do  all that I wish; because I have not sufficient means, and I am greatly thwarted  by Protestants.  25
 By the end of the nineteenth century, the rush of clerical emigrants to the  colonies had passed. From Ireland, the crest of the wave would appear  to have been the 1890s, after which the many daughter institutions 36      Ibid ., p. 13.     37     All Hallows Missionary College Drumcondra [Dublin],  Annual Report, 1850 , p. 21.     38      Ibid ., p. 22.
 founded by Irish colonial missionaries were beginning to produce more  of their own offspring and the absolute dependence on clergy production  in Ireland had waned. The pattern was similar with the clergy provided  to the colonies by the dissenting and established churches whose theo- logical colleges were scattered elsewhere in Britain. And, while the two  largest colonial missionary colleges, All Hallows and St Augustine’s,  both continued to provide clergy for the colonies after this period, the  graduates were increasingly drawn to dioceses in India and majority  black communities in Africa rather than to the white settler colonies.
 The two colleges pursued very different paths to idealise the predom- inately colonial calling which they were set up to supply. St Augustine’s  was a project which grew out of some of the most romantic aspirations  of the high church party, aspirations which had already created the  Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund   and the Christian colonisation   of the prov- ince of Canterbury in New Zealand  . All Hallows was a triumph of thrift  and the enthusiasm of one man, John Hand  , which could not afford to  over-romanticise the colonial mission. It was set up to fulfil a need: the  need of colonial bishops for clergy with few pretensions to serve in their  dioceses, and the need for aspirational young men to secure a path out  of Ireland. Both were smoothed on their way by a comforting ideology  of colonial and spiritual usefulness.
 What was the impact of these cohorts of trained clergy in the col- onies? The ordinands of St Augustine’s were inspired to follow the  paths and seaways taken from England by medieval missionary saints  such as Boniface and their latter day successors in the SPG and SPCK    in the Americas, India and New Zealand  . Their religious vocation was Table 10.4     All Hallows College, destination dioceses of matriculants,  1842–1900

 The movement also had its wry side. The memorial raised over  the body of Bishop Broughton   of Australia   in Canterbury cathedral  was intended to be the focus of pious emulation for the students of  St Augustine’s. It was an apotheosis of sorts for the lame, former clerk of  the East India Company. But, even if Broughton had had the charisma  and energy of St Francis Xavier  , whose restless body eventually came  to rest in Goa  ,  39   or the prestige of St Thomas Becket  , whose shrine in  Canterbury cathedral   was venerated by pilgrims until its destruction  in the sixteenth century, there was little prospect that his body would  attract the same kind of devotion. By the end of the nineteenth century,  the Anglican colonial missionary movement was fragmented by com- peting church factions and it had few heroes. When Bishop Broughton  was entombed in considerable state in Canterbury cathedral, a cor- respondent wrote to the archbishop of Canterbury and expressed his  opinion that it was surprising that the Australians, with their immense  goldfields, were not able to provide for his grave without assistance from  home.  40   However, the fact was that Broughton’s Evangelical successors  had already moved on to provide for their own needs. Similarly, the  pretensions of St Augustine’s to be the seat of a great missionary move- ment to the colonies meant little to the Evangelicals, who saw it not as  a powerhouse for the production of colonial clergy but as a dangerous  nest of Anglo-Catholicism. Others were less hostile, but the practical  need for the College, particularly once other theological colleges were 39     Though not exclusively. One arm of the great Jesuit saint was preserved in Rome.     40     Benjamin Harrison, archdeacon of Maidstone to William Howley, 8 November 1853, Lambeth Palace Library, Howley Papers, MS Lambeth 2203, fol. 278.
 providing clergy for colonial dioceses with less party baggage, proved  more limited than its founders had imagined.
 In contrast, the supply of priests who streamed from All Hallows  Missionary proved to be an addiction from which Catholic colonial bish- ops found it difficult to wean themselves. So long as the expansion of  the emigrant population required trained priests to provide religious   services, it was all too easy to rely on All Hallows to fill the need. The  Irish cast that this gave to the colonial churches was not perceived as a  problem so long as the bishops themselves, particularly those in Australia    and New Zealand  , shared their worldview. Such a perception only began  to change with the rise of colonial nationalism and with bishops and arch- bishops with a wider, more international, vision for the Roman church in  the British world.
 Part IV Introduction: emigrants and colonists Throughout the nineteenth century, the attitude of the churches to  emigration and colonisation remained ambivalent.  1   For those who  saw emigration as inevitable, or even Providential, it was necessary  for the Church to provide some guidance and protection to those  who were leaving British shores. The Catholic and Presbyterian  churches had the most pragmatic attitude towards this and had been  supplying emigrant services for the Irish and Scottish diasporas since  the outpourings of the 1830s.  2   However, even in Ireland, the clerical  hierarchy was conflicted about the extent to which emigration was  a boon or a hindrance to the church and nation. In response to a  government inquiry on emigration, the bishop of Clonfert, when asked  if he opposed emigration, responded ‘I am, and I am not. I am opposed  to emigration for the sake of the general welfare of the country … But  in another sense, for the individual himself, who leaves the country  and takes his youth and strength to America, it may be a blessing.’  3    Most clergy were concerned that the duty of caring for emigrants  and settlers should not impinge on the churches at home, which were  already struggling to minister to the urban poor. Emigration was open  to moral critique if it was seen to be motivated purely by the lure of  material, rather than spiritual advancement. Balancing such fears was 1     H. L. Malchow, ‘The Church and Emigration in Late Victorian England’,  Journal of  Church and State , 24 (1982), pp. 119–38.
 the abiding concern that the churches should not be outmanoeuvred  in the colonies and that sufficient  support should be provided to the  colonial churches to keep up their end against rival sects. Colonisation  was always dubious because, as the missionary societies made plain,  the arrival of British settlers was invariably accompanied by the  destruction of the original inhabitants. Only at the second half of the  nineteenth century did the churches become fully engaged with the  marketing and Christianisation of both emigration and colonisation.  By 1900, it was possible to list more than thirty church agencies – from  the Austrian Society to the Women’s Christian Temperance Union   –  which provided a ministry to emigrants in the United States alone.  4   In  contrast, the scale of church-led ministry for those heading to British  settler colonies was never so extensive, and tended to arise in response  to particular social needs  .
 In this section, we will examine the debate about the morality of col- onisation   in New Zealand  , which was a great set-piece battle between  the CMS   and other missionary societies on the one hand, and Edward  Gibbon Wakefield   and the proponents of colonisation on the other.  While Wakefield and the colonial reformers led the way, there were  other groups within Victorian society who came to see the colonies as  places for the renewal and reform of pressing problems in the home soci- ety. In  Chapter 11 , we look at the emergence of advocates for emigra- tion as a social panacea, including Caroline Chisholm  , the Highlands  and Islands Emigration Society   and General Booth of the Salvation  Army. By century’s end, from being reluctant colonists, some Christian  leaders were advocating a general evacuation of Britain as the only solu- tion to the ills of what General Booth of the Salvation Army liked to call  ‘Darkest England’  .
 The second chapter in this section looks at full-scale attempts to  create church-based colonies, on the model of those that featured  in the settlement of the colonies of North America. While to some  degree Wakefield gave most of his schemes of systematic colonisation  a moral or religious quality, the most notable imperial attempts at  creating church-led settlements were the evangelical colony of Sierra  Leone  , the Free Church of Scotland settlement of Otago   in New  Zealand  , the Anglican settlement of Canterbury in New Zealand  and the Anglican Britannia Colony in Saskatchewan  , Canada. In the 4     For a list, see J. B. Clark, ‘Emigrants and Immigrants, Mission Work Among’, in  The  New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge , ed. S. M. Jackson (New York  and London, 1909), pp. 119–20.
 course of these colonial ventures, we can see a complete reversal of  earlier religious objections to colonisation – from one of outright con- demnation, to wholesale endorsement. The churches, or at least some  of their more enterprising adherents, were claiming these imperial  lands as their own.
 Samuel Hinds Where did the idea of ‘colonisation on a religious basis’ come from? Was  Hinds the first to promote such a scheme for the British empire? The  short answer to the second question is, clearly, no. We have already seen  that the SPG had been attempting to Christianise the colonies since  early in the eighteenth century and that most of the larger churches  participated in the colonial missionary movement by forming their own  societies to do similar work from the first decades of the nineteenth.  In addition, religion played a significant role in the settlement of the  first thirteen American colonies and many settlers, including Quakers,  Puritans, Presbyterians and Catholics, came to the New World   in search  of religious toleration.  3   Nevertheless, Hinds was one of the first Anglican  clergymen to take up the ideas of Edward Gibbon Wakefield  , and give  systematic colonisation a religious twist. An account of his life provides  important insight into the social milieu of those Christian leaders who  came to see emigration as not just a solution to a social problem, but  an opportunity to create Christian communities throughout the British  world.  4
 Hinds was a liberal in theology and politics who had connections to  the leading scholars, churchmen and politicians of the day through his  intimate friendship with the logician, Richard Whately   (1787–1863).  5    Hinds was born in Barbados   to a prominent planter family; a namesake,  Samuel Hinds, was President (i.e. administrator) of Barbados in 1821.  6    He was educated in Bristol and Oxford, and ordained before returning  to the West Indies   in 1822 as a missionary for the (Anglican) Society  for the Conversion of Negroes  .  7   William Howley   (1766–1848), later 3     Sites for religious settlements   included: 1620, Plymouth, Massachusetts (Pilgrims);  1629, New England (Puritans); 1632, Maryland (Roman Catholics); and 1656,  Pennsylvania (Quakers).
 7     The Incorporated Society for the Conversion and Religious Instruction and Education  of the Negro Slaves in the British West India Islands   was under the presidency of the archbishop of Canterbury (1828–48), recommended him as Principal  of Codrington College   in Barbados,  8   which had been established by  the SPG from the income of two slave plantations bequeathed to it by  Colonel Christopher Codrington in 1710.  9   Hinds returned to Oxford to  work with Whately  , and his career took off in 1831 when the latter was  made Anglican archbishop of Dublin and invited Hinds to go with him  as his examining chaplain. This was a testing time for the English epis- copate when, led by Archbishop Howley, they mounted a stolid resist- ance in the House of Lords to the passage of the Reform Bill  . Hinds and  Whately had direct experience of the public antipathy to bishops this  aroused when a mob surrounded their carriage in Birmingham, ready,  according to Whately’s daughter, ‘for any violent act’.  10   In fact, Whately  was one of the few bishops to support parliamentary reform; he also  supported the abolition of convict transportation and the removal of all  civic disabilities affecting Jews and Catholics – while reserving the right  to criticise their beliefs.
 Through Whately, Hinds was therefore in the vanguard of Anglican  church reformers. He was part of the generation which had been swept  up in the debates about the social and religious condition of Great  Britain and which was radicalised by the economic and political crises of  the 1840s. While retaining a deep affection for the Church of England,  they were moderate liberals in their theology and politics and intrepid  in embracing reform for the Church at home, and new opportunities for  the Church in the colonies, with or without the benefit of establishment.  Whately   himself was later identified with the broad church   group at the  University of Oxford which included academics and intellectuals such  as Benjamin Jowett  , Master of Balliol College, Robert Baden Powell  ,  founder of the Boy Scout movement, and Frederick Temple, educa- tionist and later archbishop of Canterbury.  11   This was very different bishop of London. In 1824, it was noted that the Report showed ‘more promise than  produce’ in the effect of its purpose.

 to the social and intellectual milieu that had nourished the moral  campaign to end the slave trade   in the previous generation. While the  early abolitionists had been Tory high churchmen and committed to  the  status quo , the anti-colonisation   movement, discussed later in this  chapter, was dominated by Evangelicals and Nonconformists. When  Evangelicals moved to oppose colonisation in New Zealand  , many in  the high church who had earlier opposed slavery were unwavering in  their support of the SPG and its colonial mission. On the issue of col- onisation, Hinds joined the majority of Peelites (liberal Conservatives)  who supported emigration as a solution to social problems, and high  churchmen, who believed in the extension of the national Church   in the  colonies. It was these high churchmen who became most engaged in the  scheme for the Canterbury colony.
 Hinds’ interest in what he dubbed ‘Christian colonisation’   began  in the 1830s, when, as vicar of Yardley, he began to preach and pub- lish on emigration and the colonisation of New Zealand  .  12   In 1837,  he was the sole clergyman on the Committee of the New Zealand  Association.  13   According to Temple, it was Hinds who contributed  the chapter on ‘Religious Establishment’ in the Association’s major  prospectus.  14   If Hinds is indeed the author of this chapter, it is strik- ing that a future Anglican bishop should give such hearty endorse- ment to the principle, said to be characteristic of the Canadas,  Australia   and India, that no denomination should be given preferen- tial treatment in British colonies. Instead, all denominations would  be entitled to build churches, maintain a minister and take a share  in religious establishment. The next suggestion – a brilliant counter  to the (Evangelical) Church Missionary Society that was at the fore- front of opposition to the New Zealand Association’s plans – was to  propose that an Anglican bishop be appointed for New Zealand. In 12     S. Hinds and R. Bourke,  The Latest Official Documents Relating to New Zealand, with  Introductory Observations  (London, 1838). I have not been able to verify that Hinds  was writing on Christian colonisation as early as 1832, i.e. before he left Dublin for  Yardley, as stated on the Christchurch cathedral plaque.
 due course, this was to be George Augustus Selwyn  , a school friend  of Gladstone   at Eton. According to the prospectus, while the mis- sionaries were encouraged to continue their work of civilising the  natives, it would be the task of the bishop to civilise and uplift the  colonists.  15   While an Anglican bishop would only have authority over  his own church, it was argued that the general civilising balm created  by the presence of a bishop would benefit the whole colony, presum- ably by a kind of cultural osmosis.
 decades earlier,  19   Hinds’ high church missionary background made it  seem right to him that British colonies should have their own bishops  and church establishments and not be left to the interim arrangements  provided by the Evangelical missionary societies. In 1840, Hinds deliv- ered an anniversary sermon on behalf of the SPG and the SPCK   in  Hertford in which he gave his strong endorsement to the need for the  Church of England to participate fully in the enterprise of systematic  religious colonisation.  20
 Hinds was here echoing the arguments which led the Colonial  Bishoprics’ Fund   (1841), an initiative associated most closely with  Bishop Blomfield   of London, which had profound implications for the  expansion of Anglicanism in the colonies.  22   But, more than this, Hinds  was also capturing the spirit of the age in which emigrants, having been  derided as those with no stake in the British nation, were to be lauded  as the creators of a new, moral and Christian empire overseas.
 Edward Gibbon Wakefield While Hinds played his part, the man who deserves credit for incorp- orating what he called ‘the moral factor’ into emigration was not a  cleric, but an unlikely, not particularly religious, former felon –  Edward Gibbon Wakefield.  23   Wakefield was a man ever eager to pro- mote his own importance and originality. Until the 1990s, the verdict  of posterity has been to undercut the unique role he claimed for him- self in inspiring the rebirth of colonisation on a religious – or any 19     Buchanan,  Colonial Ecclesiastical Establishment .     20     S.

 other – foundation.  24   Temple sums up the consensus that Wakefield’s  religiosity was never more than a ‘sort of conscience’, pointing out that  Wakefield was happy to leave the business of morality to the female  members of his family, and religious institution building in the colonies  to the churches.  25   Nevertheless, over the course of his life, Wakefield  slowly moulded an argument for colonisation in which religion came  to play a prominent role.
 at heart.’  30   In order to suppress such uncivil habits, Wakefield proposed  that colonies should be created which were effectively extensions of the  old society; and the main means for doing this was to encourage the  emigration of people of all stations in life, including clergy and other  members of the professional middle classes.  31   Purified of the indigest- ible sources of social upheaval at home, including their civil, religious  and economic constraints and inequalities, Wakefield argued that sys- tematically colonised communities would inevitably generate wealth  not only for the emigrants themselves but for the societies whose pov- erty they left behind in the old world.  32   All this would be achieved  by the simple means of fixing the price of land at a level sufficient to  secure colonial infrastructure with one-eighth of the revenue set aside  to support educational and religious endowments such as churches,  schools and clerical stipends.  33   Wakefield always claimed that it did  not matter what creed colonists happened to profess; they could all  be accommodated in one or other scheme of colonisation. Clergy are  discussed in his early writing, including  A Letter from Sydney , simply  as one of many professional groups who might usefully be encour- aged to form part of an ideal colony. It is also unclear if Wakefield  was aware that his advocacy of commercial colonisation of new lands  would open him up to conflict with missionaries who were, of course,  already established in colonies and less than delighted with the pros- pect of new arrivals intent on personal gain.
 the commercial colonisation companies provided was marketing, and  this is where religion proved its usefulness. In the volume published by  the South Australia Company, the Wesleyan journalist, John Stephens    (1806–50),  35   promoted South Australia as ‘The Land of Promise’    36   – a  phrase which consciously invoked God’s biblical promise of the land of  Israel to Abraham.  37   The editor of the  South Australian Record  went fur- ther: the landing of the first colonists recalled for him the ‘awful emigra- tion’ of Noah, the promise given to Moses,  38   the Tyrians of Carthage,  of Aeneas and the founding settlement of Rome, or the ‘stout-hearted  Britons’ who created the colonies in America.  39   It was to be a free colony,  without convicts or established church, in which the ‘voluntary prin- ciple’ in relation to religion might be properly tested. In the chapter on  religious provision, Stephens outlines how South Australia   would give  preference to no particular religion, but ample support for cultural pro- vision of churches, schools and newspapers to all.  40   This was not really  colonisation without religion, but simply without religious proscription,  a different matter. Ultimately, while colonists were motivated primarily  by commercial considerations in South Australia – as they were every- where else – its Nonconformist character was underpinned through co- option of the Baptist businessman, George Fife Angas   (1789–1879), by  the South Australia Company  .  41   Angas had earlier attempted to per- suade the Colonial Office to support his own scheme for a colony with- out an established church or convict labour. He did more than anyone 35     For Stephens, see  Australian Dictionary of Biography , vol. 2, pp. 480–1. He was a  founder of the Methodist  Christian Advocate  (1832), an important vehicle for the anti- slavery movement.
 to earn the title of founder of the colony because he not only sustained it  with his own capital but encouraged other Nonconformists to emigrate  and invest there.  42
 When the settlement at South Australia   showed signs of failing to  live up to its promise, biblical or otherwise, Wakefield began turning  his attention to the possibilities in Canada: he arrived there in 1838,  not long after the 1837 rebellion   had created a climate which was ripe  for reform. Wakefield’s views are reflected in an earlier comparative  study of England and America.  43   This shows the extent to which he was  developing his thinking about the nature of the middle class, whom in  an evocative phrase he calls the ‘middle or uneasy class’ and who had  not generally been incorporated into earlier schemes of emigration.  44    Among those distressed for employment in Britain, he included under- employed clergy ‘eager to obtain a miserable curacy’,  45   who would ben- efit professionally by emigration. Otherwise, he regarded the churches  as lacking the initiative to contribute to effective colonial development.  In Canada, he states, the politicised clergy of the established church  had obtained title to great tracts of land which they were unable to  use.  46   Wakefield saw the clergy reserves as a prime example of the mis- management of land by narrow-minded conservative forces.
 that the company was able to begin practical plans for enlisting capital  and colonists for settlements (discussed in the next chapter). By this  time, Wakefield had also revised his earlier views about clergy, many of  whom were quick to see the potential social benefits of emigration. No  longer derided as starving curates who might be encouraged to hitch  a ride on the colonisation bandwagon, clerics were invited to speak at  meetings called by the National Colonization Society where they could  give its promotion a new, religious spin.
 common worship, by the fellowship of an unearthly communion, to the  generations which have gone before.’  51   Clearly, there were attractions in  this theme for clergy and adherents of all classes and creeds of British  society, from the Baptist mechanic listening to Underhill, to the Queen  herself following Conybeare’s sermon in the Chapel Royal.
 Following this new trend, the insertion of religious provisions into  schemes of colonisation became  de rigueur . Commercial emigration  schemes would advertise that there were clergymen available to pro- vide religious comforts to settlers. This was a marked contrast to the  commercial priorities of the charter companies which had blazed the  way on previous colonial frontiers. As we have seen, South Australia    was the first settler colony to consider religious matters in its promo- tion. The Church of England was given priority in the plans of the  Western Australian Company  , which enlisted Wakefield as a director  in 1838. According to its prospectus, the settlement of Australind in  western Australia would have ‘a high moral and religious tone’.  52   Like  South Australia, it would be convict-free and the promoters aspired  that the settlement be endowed with an Anglican bishopric;  53   there  were equally grand plans for schools and churches. Western Australia  was a poor colony, and none of this was realistic. No matter, Wakefield  was determined that nowhere was too remote, poorly endowed with  natural resources, or underpopulated to be uplifted by a properly man- aged scheme of emigration. When the schemes failed, he would blame  this on the failure to implement his principles with sufficient rigour.
 Anti-colonialism Even as the colonial reformers were providing evidence to the  Parliamentary Committee on Colonial Lands   (1836), and facilitating  the settlement of South Australia  , Western Australia and townships  in New Zealand  , anti-colonial storm clouds were massing to rain on  the parade of systematic colonisation.  54   As Edward Said was aware, 51     ‘Sermon XIV: Christian Colonization’, in W. J. Conybeare,  Sermons Preached in the  Chapel Royal at Whitehall, During the Years 1841, 1842, and 1843  (London, 1844),  pp. 186–7. From 1842 to 1848, Conybeare was the first principal of the Liverpool  Collegiate Institution, a public school for boys founded by the Edward Smith- Stanley (1799–1869), who was Secretary of State for War and the Colonies from 1841  to 1845.
 Elbourne,  Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape there had been objections raised against colonies on both economic  and moral grounds from well before the eighteenth century.  55   Now,  humanitarians from across a wide range of churches launched a com- bined attack on British settler colonialism in the course of the hearings  and subsequent published reports of the 1836 Select Committee of the  House of Commons on Aborigines    . Receiving testimony from British  settlements in Canada, the Cape Colony  , Australia and New Zealand,  the Committee reached damning conclusions about the impact of col- onisation on native people.  56   Against settler protests, the strongest  voices against further British colonisation were those of the leaders  of British missionary societies and colonial clergy. In evidence to the  Select Committee, Dandeson Coates  , the Lay Secretary of the Church  Missionary Society, spoke specifically against the proposals to colonise  New Zealand that he claimed would lead inevitably to the destruction  of native society and a fatal interruption to the missionaries’ successful  work of Christian progress among the Maori   people.  57
 58     The first mission to the Maori was begun in 1814 under the auspices of the Church  Missionary Society on the initiative of the Reverend Samuel Marsden. Wesleyan and  Catholic missions followed in 1824 and 1838 respectively. By 1850, about 60 per cent  of the Maori appear to have become affiliated with one or other missions in a conver- sion movement led by Maori evangelists. For general history of Christianity in New  Zealand, including these early missions, see Breward,  Churches in Australasia , pp.  83–7; and A. K. Davidson,  Christianity in Aotearoa: A History of Church and Society in  New Zealand  (Wellington, 1991).
 There was therefore much at stake when Dandeson Coates, the lay  secretary of the Church Missionary Society and the most articulate of  the anti-colonialists, chose to direct all his eloquence at the overthrow  of the planned colonisation of New Zealand  . Coates laid down his  objections in the form of a printed letter to Lord Glenelg  , Secretary 59     C. Orange,  The Treaty of Waitangi  (Wellington, 1987), pp. 32–59.     60     Wakefield to Reverend Charles Torlesse, 12 May 1837, quoted by H. J. Rose, A. P.

 of the possible in relation to aboriginal policy.  80   When New Zealand  was finally annexed to the British crown as part of the colony of New  South Wales, the instructions to the Consul of New Zealand, William  Hobson  , provided extensive instructions on his obligation to promote  the ‘Civilization of the New Zealanders’, ‘understanding by that term  whatever relates to the religious, intellectual and social advancement of  mankind’.  81   In January 1840, the British government went on to annex  the whole of New Zealand to the British crown – an event which, as  we have seen, was celebrated as a triumph for the British empire in  Christchurch’s Anglican cathedral. More to the point, under the guise  of Christian colonisation, the colonial reformers had secured a major  defeat for the Christian anti-colonial movement. Even Selwyn  , who had  arrived in 1842 and initially envisioned himself as a missionary bishop  to the Maori and later the Melanesians, was soon largely engaged with  the settler, rather than the missionary, church.  82
 Wakefield has long been suspected of cynical manipulation of the  religion card in order to secure support for his schemes. However, this  is not entirely just. Wakefield ascribed his conversion to the idea of the  centrality of religion for colonial enterprises in the  Art of Colonization     (1849). He also noted that religion was not an original part of the pre- cepts of the Colonial Society when it was formed in 1830, only later  coming to embrace the colonising potential of religious movements.  83    The Canterbury colony (considered in the next chapter) was in some  ways the culmination of his long-standing interest in the influence  of religion on colonial settlements. Indeed, with typical braggadocio,  Wakefield claimed that he was responsible for converting the arch- bishop of Canterbury to his view of colonisation and leading the way –  presumably through the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund   – to bishoprics  not only in Canterbury, but also in Tasmania, South Australia  , South  Africa  , ‘Australia Felix’ (Victoria) and elsewhere in the empire.  84   He  also claimed to have encouraged religious provisions for colonists of all  denominations, Catholics, Presbyterians, Dissenters and Jews. All were  equally welcome to the embraces of the Canterbury Association  .  85   In  another moral twist, Wakefield also recommended that women   should  be encouraged to emigrate, for they gave virtue, politeness and stability 80     Carrington,  British Overseas , pp. 389–90.     81     Instructions from the Secretary of State for War and Colonies, Lord Normanby, to Captain Hobson, 14 August 1839, Colonial Office 209/4, pp. 251–81.     82     Breward,  Churches in Australasia , p. 91.     83     E.

 to colonial society.  86   Overall, it was essential to consider religion, if  only to avoid giving offence to the most powerful group in society: ‘If  you had made no provisions for religion in your colony, and if people  here only cared enough about you to find that out, your scheme would  be vituperated by religious men, who are numerous; and by religious  women, who are very numerous; and by the clergy of all denomina- tions, who are immensely powerful.’  87
 Religion now lay at the heart of Wakefield’s plans for new colonies, but  for pragmatic rather than sectarian reasons. History, he believed, was  on his side. All the most favoured colonial systems  , from those of the  ancient Greeks and Romans to the old colonisation of North America,  incorporated a religious element. In America in particular, the English  had created colonies which were so thoroughly imbued with religious  character that they tended to be known by their religion more than any- thing else:  88   Virginia for the Church of England, Maryland for Roman  Catholics, Pennsylvania for Quakers, New England for Puritans. But  Wakefield was not interested in promoting one form of religion over  another. Instead, he makes the astute comment that, although religious  settlements were said to have been founded in order to enable the found- ers to enjoy liberty of conscience, the main reason for their success as  colonies was that they allowed for the creation of exclusive settlements,  with the Puritans   pushing this to its most extreme forms: ‘It was not  persecution for its own sake that they loved; it was the power of making  their religion the religion of their whole community.’  89   Wakefield goes  on to state his fundamental view about the role to be played by religion  in colonisation, which centred on its power to attract the ‘best people’  to colonise as it had done in America: ‘All that colonisation was more  or less a religious colonisation: the parts of it that prospered the most,  were the most religious parts: the prosperity was chiefly occasioned by  the respectability of the emigration: and the respectability of the emi- gration to each colony had a close relation to the force of the religious  attraction.’  90   And Wakefield then argues that the time is right for Britain  to once again plant religious colonies as had previously been done in  America, and he looked encouragingly to the Church of England, the  Church of Scotland, and the Wesleyan Methodists to bring this about.
 The humanitarian scruples of the anti-colonial movement and the  needs of the New Zealand   Maori   or the Australian Aborigines seem to  have caused him no qualms of any kind.
 Surprisingly, some of Wakefield’s most eloquent defenders came  not from among his own liberal cronies but from the Tory party who  saw systematic colonisation as a way to export the British class system  and the established church throughout the empire. One of the highest  of them all, the member for Oxford, Sir Robert Inglis  , was one of  many who argued that the old commercial way of running the empire  was not good enough for creating British colonies: ‘Nothing, in his  opinion, could deserve the name of a colony of Great Britain, which  did not represent all the interests, civil and religious, of the mother  country, which was not, in fact, a miniature representation of England,  complete in every part, according to its proportions.’  95   Joseph Hume    (1777–1855), the Scottish radical and guardian of the public purse,  was less impressed, and noted that there was one major difference  between the classical mode of colonisation and those advocated in the  present day: ‘The hon. Baronet appeared to forget that New England  was founded by men who had actually run away from bishops.’ It  was not the Church, let alone bishops, which allowed the colonies to  prosper, but rather the economic and political power of England.  96   The  Whig Leader, Lord John Russell,   was particularly keen to knock on  the head the idea that church establishments should be set up in the  colonies. In New South Wales, the law made provision equally for all  religious sects, he observed, and this was in his opinion the only way in  which mixed communities of settlers could be governed effectively.  97    He endorsed a similar policy in Ireland  .
 which encouraged families to emigrate as a group. Instead of colon- isation for the few and the wealthy, she called for a national system of  colonisation, an enterprise which would excite British patriotism and  bring more women to the colonies. What men need in the bush was the  domestic blessing of wives: ‘Give them help-mates, and you make mur- muring, discontented servants, loyal and happy subjects of the State.’  100    The addition of 100 couples in the bush would enable them to build a  more religious and moral community, which would be able to support  a clergyman without application to the State.  101   Such arguments were  appealing enough to convince men of such different religious views as  Lord Shaftesbury, an Evangelical, and Sydney Herbert, a Tractarian,  of the benefits of her scheme. With their support, Chisholm founded  the Family Colonization Loan Society   which advanced small loans  to emigrants. At a great meeting of the Society on 28 February 1852  in the British Institution in Tabernacle Row in London, some 2,500  people attended a great meeting chaired by the Earl of Shaftesbury  which extolled the value of emigration under a banner which read  ‘Advance Australia’ and ‘God Speed the Plough’. By 1854, the Society  had helped over 3,000 people migrate to the colonies and there was  no more question of the morality and respectability of the colonisation  enterprise. The manufacturer of a system of patented portable houses  created an emigrants’ hostel, with accommodation for seventy-nine  people, to Chisholm’s design, as well as an entire portable town includ- ing a church and parsonage, and churches constructed to the specifica- tions of the bishops of Melbourne and Sydney.  102   It could truly be said  that the export of migrants and providing for their religious needs was  becoming an industrial operation.
 Scots were also targeted in the various emigration schemes of  John Dunmore Lang  . In his manual for prospective emigrants to  ‘Philipsland’ (i.e. Victoria), Lang devoted a lengthy chapter to religion  and education, noting his fears for the alleged ‘Romanising’ tenden- cies of all the Anglican bishops so far appointed to the Australasian  colonies.  106   In order to head off these dangerous developments, Lang  attempted to launch his own emigration company that would seek ‘to  give an impulse to emigration of a thoroughly Protestant character  from England, Scotland, and the North of Ireland’.  107   For this purpose  he travelled to England, Scotland and Ireland from 1847 to 1849, try- ing to get commercial backing for the scheme, often holding meetings  in Protestant places of worship. What Lang was promoting was what he  called ‘schemes of Christian emigration’ that would favour Scottish and 103     A. Ewing,  Sermon on Emigration from the Highlands and Islands of Scotland to Australia  by the Bishop of Argyle and the Isles  (London, 1852).
 Irish Protestants in preference to the hordes of Roman Catholic labour- ers who, in his view, were arriving out of all proportion to their useful- ness to the colony.  108   Meanwhile, Lang claimed to have done much to  awaken public interest in emigration both through his weekly letters in  the  British Banner  in favour of ‘Australian emigration to be conducted  on Christian principles’ and his speaking tours throughout the coun- try. For Lang it was a ‘matter of life and death to the interests of our  common Protestantism in Australia’   that his scheme should prove suc- cessful. Lang also spoke of the other informal emigration networks that  were springing up, not only in Australia but in Natal and elsewhere,  in which bodies of emigrants together with ministers of religion were  planning to head to the colonies.  109   It was just a short step from Lang’s  shoestring efforts to the launching of full-scale colonisation plans for  Christian colonies, on the Wakefield model, which had the explicit  backing of the home churches.
 Other schemes of emigration came and went, sometimes with church- men at their helm. The Queensland Immigration Society   was devised  by James Quinn  , first Catholic bishop of Brisbane (1859–81).  110   The  organisation had the blessing of the pope and allowed Quinn effectively  to people his diocese direct from Ireland with the benefit of subsidised  passage provided by the Queensland government. Before it was quashed,  the Society secured the passage of 3,901 emigrants and £54,281 worth  of orders for land in what was jokingly referred to as ‘Quinnland’.  111   In  terms of sheer numbers, it was one of the most successful of all emi- gration schemes under the patronage of clergy. However, apart from  Quinn’s involvement, this was not strictly a religious scheme. In rec- ommending it to prospective colonists, Quinn’s agent, the Reverend P.  Dunne  , bemoaned the conditions in Ireland which made it necessary  for so many to leave; however, he added: ‘I see no other hope at present  for the poor down-trodden people of this country, but to fly to the most  distant part of the world, where there is perfect equality, civil and reli- gious liberty, no poorhouses to demoralize the people, and no landlords  to exterminate them.’  112   By shipping out with vessels despatched under  the auspices of the Queensland Immigration Society, Dunne gave pious  emigrants his assurance that they would be accompanied by both a  priest and a matron whose presence would serve to guarantee order and 108      Ibid ., p. 9.    109      Ibid ., p. 10.     110     McLay,  James Quinn , pp. 48–9.     111     Henry Cleary, ‘Archdiocese of Brisbane’,  The Catholic Encyclopedia , vol. 2 (New York, 1907).     112     P. Dunne,  The Emigrant’s Guide to Queensland and the Other Australian Colonies (Dublin, 1863), p. 2.
 The first major work on behalf of emigrants by the Church of England  was the establishment of the Emigrants’ Spiritual Aid Fund  , which had  been managed by the SPG since 1841.  115   From about 1870, however,  there was renewed pressure on the national Church to be seen to be  doing more for emigrants.  116   Now, with the support of the archbishop  of Canterbury, Archibald Tait   (1811–82), an emigration committee  was established as a permanent committee of the SPCK  . Clergy were  also appointed to the National Association for the Promotion of State  Colonization  . In 1870, the National Emigration League   was formed  which crossed denominational lines and included seven bishops, nine  Nonconformist clergy, and one Roman Catholic, Cardinal Manning  ,  on its board.  117   In 1881, Tait published an Emigration Circular in  The  Times , which directed clergy to provide support to prospective emi- grants and tried to encourage a positive attitude towards emigration.  118
 The largest Anglican organisation committed to the promotion of  emigration as a cure for social ills was the Church Emigration Society  ,  which was founded in 1886. The archbishop of Canterbury was suffi- ciently interested in their work to issue a number of letters which were  included by the SPCK in its handbooks for colonists. He noted: ‘It is  no business of the Church to actually promote Emigration but it is our  business to provide that they who emigrate shall do so under circum- stances as religiously happy as we can ensure for them.’  119   The Society  had its own journal,  The Emigrant   , and sufficient funds to assist between  300 and 600 emigrants per year. An early issue states that the object of  the Church Emigration Society was: ‘to assist persons duly approved by  the Executive Committee to emigrate to British Colonies, where they  may live and prosper under a British flag’.  120   Religion is not mentioned  and the tone of editorials was bracingly patriotic. In 1891,  The Emigrant   asserted that the expansion of the empire made a call to the national and  patriotic feelings of fellow countrymen, while stressing the appreciation 113      Ibid ., p. 20.    114     McLay,  James Quinn , p. 72.     115     For the Emigrants’ Spiritual Aid Fund, see Pascoe,  Two Hundred Years of the SPG , pp. 818–20.     116     Malchow, ‘Church and Emigration’, pp. 121–6.     117      Ibid ., pp. 130–1.    118      The Times , 22 December 1881.     119     Benson circular letter, June 1886, Lambeth Palace Library, Benson Papers, vol. 34
 of close ties between ‘the Mother Country and her Colonies’. Praise  is given to the societies such as the Imperial Federation League and  the Colonial Institute which fostered the common bond, while there  was recognition of the team and electricity which provided the tech- nology which made it possible. The Church Emigration Society also  acted as an employment agency and attempted to assist British subjects  to find homes and future employment in the colonies.  121   To this end,   The Emigrant  provided a medium for job advertisements, especially for  female domestics and farm workers. There were also advertisements for  passages on the different shipping companies, such as the Royal Mail  Service between England and Australia  , or the Dominion Line, Beaver  Line and Allan Line to Canada and the United States, or the Union  Line for the South African goldfields. The Church Emigration Society  was clearly not so much a colonial missionary society as a colonial infor- mation service that made use of the imperial network of the Church  of England to facilitate colonisation. About ten years later, the Society  began producing a quarterly newsletter in a smaller, newsier format.  122    This continued to emphasise the Society’s official ‘Church’ credentials,  including the archbishop of Canterbury as president and the bishop of  London as vice president. The objects are restated to be that of pro- viding letters of introduction to colonial clergy in order to avert the  danger of ‘practical irreligion’. Subsequent issues covered articles on  ‘Emigration and Thrift’ (January 1903), ‘Farm Work in Ontario’ (April  1904), ‘Emigrant Children in Canada’ and ‘Are Educated Women  Wanted in Canada?’ (April 1910), and advertised schemes such as the  ‘Archbishop’s Western Canada Fund and the CES’ (April 1910). The  work was surprisingly long-lived, and in 1916, it went on to promote  settlement schemes for ex-servicemen in Canada after the war.  123
 Compared with the work of government agencies, the scale of assist- ance provided by church emigration societies was small; however,  they were not insignificant. The largest of them, the Salvation Army  Emigration Department  , secured passages for close to 50,000 emigrants  between 1908 and 1914.  124   In the same period, other church societies  that sponsored emigrants included the Catholic Emigration Society    (for children), the Church Army, the Church Emigration Society, the  Jewish Board of Guardians, the Jews Emigration Society, St Andrew’s  Waterside Church Mission, and St Katherine’s Mission Emigration 121      Ibid ., p. 1.     122     Church Emigration Society,  Quarterly Notes of the Church Emigration Society  (1902).
 The churches were particularly active in emigration schemes for chil- dren, or ‘rescue’ as it was generally known.  126   A number of schemes for  the support of emigration were launched in the 1880s and 1890s as an  extension of mission programmes directed at the urban poor. These  schemes sent children to many parts of the British world, but they had  their focus on Canada, then at the height of its western expansion, as  well as Australia  . From her new home in New Zealand  , Maria Susan  Rye   was one of the first to encourage schemes for child migration aimed  at removing ‘waifs and strays’ from the streets of ‘Darkest England’  and securing them a new life abroad. Child rescue organisations used  the language of missions to rhetorically reconfigure the tough streets  of English cities as heathen territory from which children were waiting  to be saved – washed clean and white from the dirt, heathendom and  immorality of Britain by transfer to the ‘Better Britain’ of the Australian  or Canadian colonies. The Catholic Church was just as active in child  emigration as the Church of England.  127   In 1874, Cardinal Manning  began the ‘Crusade of Rescue’   in the archdiocese of Westminster,  which aimed to remove children from the social blight of London to  healthier destinations in the colonies. Earlier, Father J. Nugent   had  sent children to Canada from Liverpool. Catholic child rescue organi- sations worked in partnership with religious congregations, such as the  Sisters of Mercy  , the Sisters of Nazareth   and the Christian Brothers  , 125     Female Middle Class Emigration Society brochure, in Lambeth Palace Library,  Benson Papers, vol. 3 (1883).
 Of all the churches, the Salvation Army  , founded in London in 1865  by the Methodists, William Booth   (1829–1912) and his wife Catherine    (1829–90), became the most ardent proponent of church-led emigra- tion for people of all classes.  128   In his hugely successful book,  Darkest  England and the Way Out  (1890), Booth advocated the ‘Colony over  Sea’ as a solution to poverty on a mass scale; the only problem he could  foresee which might limit the success of the plan was that of homesick- ness. The solution to this was to ensure that as many people as possible  emigrated together, including fathers, mothers and children who would  meet together in what he envisioned as a communal utopia in the col- onies. Once established there, families would work together in the fields  and workshops, in between regular attendances at religious services: ‘It  will resemble nothing so much as the unmooring of a little piece of  England, and towing it across the sea to find a safe anchorage in a  sunnier clime.’  129   Booth was denounced for his escapist solution, which  failed to address the structural basis of poverty or the related issue of  working-class alienation from institutional religion.  130   However, the  Salvation Army was the logical outcome of trends in the ‘social gospel’  that transformed a branch of his own Methodist tradition into one that  was given over entirely to the single task of home and colonial mission  work. By the 1880s, Booth had extended his army to many parts of the  empire, including Australia  , New Zealand  , Canada, Jamaica and India.  Booth personally visited many of these sites in his role as the ‘General  of Salvation’. However, whereas other religious travellers, such as John  Clifford whom we encountered in the first chapter, were only tourists,  Booth came as the founder of a new British imperial church.  131   The  Salvation Army strived to fulfil the utopian vision of  Darkest England     as a world free of poverty; this was a colonial mission that would be the  salvation of the English-speaking people.
 systematic colonisation, not religion. Only in the last, New Zealand  ,  phase of his colonising enterprises does he seem to have turned to the  Church of England as his major supporter for what others had begun to  call ‘Christian colonisation’  . Prior to this, he was fond of insisting that the  adherents of all religious persuasions stood to profit from his ideas. For  Wakefield, religion was useful chiefly as a means of galvanising support  for schemes of colonisation. His repeated invocation of the example of  the Pilgrim Fathers, like that of the Greek colonists of antiquity, was  mostly part of the glib rhetoric of the colonisation salesman that he  was. Convinced of the logic and merit of these principles of systematic  colonisation, Wakefield was as unmoved by the strictures of Dandeson  Coates and the anti-colonial movement, as he was by the sermons of  the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. If he had attended the  anniversary sermons of the colonial missionary societies from the other  major denominations, which are traversed in  Part II  of this book, he  would undoubtedly have remained unmoved. The arguments from  religion, patriotism and imperialism, which gave support to the colonial  missionary movement, were not those that convinced him. Nevertheless,  Wakefield had clearly started something. What he originally referred to  as the ‘moral element’ in colonisation was taken up with enthusiasm  and commitment by religious proponents of systematic colonisation  as ‘Christian colonisation’. In the 1840s, with the rural population of  Great Britain facing famine and the desolation of economic reform,  philanthropists were also prepared to leave aborigines to their fate.  Coates pleaded that New Zealand might be left to the Maori   for fifty  years. Like Las Casas, he was to be ignored.
 At the beginning of the nineteenth century, emigration and colon- isation were both seen as solutions to social problems from pauper- ism to religious dissent. While Wakefield claims to have had the most  influence, in fact all the churches took up the cause of emigration and  colonisation. Those who supported emigration as a solution included  those with a more or less transparent commercial motivation, such  as Wakefield, but also included religious and social idealists with an  unblemished reputation for altruism, including Caroline Chisholm, or  General Booth. In at least four cases, churchmen were more directly  engaged in the organisation of schemes of colonisation and attempts  were made to create denominational settlements. These were the  former slave colony of Sierra Leone  , the high church Anglican settle- ment of Canterbury, and the Free Church of Scotland settlement of  Otago, which were both in New Zealand, and the Anglican Barr (or  Britannia) Colony of Saskatchewan. These will be our destinations in  the next chapter.
 The previous chapter has examined the idea of Christian colonisation     as  promoted through the writing of colonial reformers including Edward  Gibbon Wakefield and Samuel Hinds, and religious philanthropists  including Caroline Chisholm and General Booth of the Salvation  Army. As we have seen, the anti-colonial lobby who struggled to prevent  the colonisation of New Zealand   were defeated, which opened the  way to systematic or planned colonisation of British colonial territory  not only in New Zealand but also in Canada and parts of Africa.  This chapter looks at the Christian colonies that were planned and  imagined in the course of the nineteenth century and which were in  some ways the culmination of the colonial missionary movement. The  first Christian experiment in colonisation in the second British empire  was that of Sierra Leone  , a settlement intended to provide a home for  liberated slaves. However, commercial schemes of colonisation were  responsible for promoting many more, a number of which succeeded  in some at least of their objectives. The two most ambitious Christian  colonies in the later British empire were the Free Church of Scotland  settlement of Otago and the Anglican settlement of Canterbury, both  in the South Island of New Zealand. While historians, particularly  those in New Zealand, have been right to question the strength of  the religious element in systematic colonisation, Christian settlement  has left a distinctive imprint on New Zealand society, which was so  frequently imagined as not just a part of Greater Britain   but a ‘Better  Britain’.  1   While it is important not to over-emphasise the significance of  religion in Antipodean settlement – colonisation was overwhelmingly  an economic rather than a spiritual enterprise – it is also true that  the religious arguments: about missions to the native people, about 1     Argued with flair by J. Belich,  Making Peoples: A History of the New Zealanders from  Polynesian Settlement to the End of the Nineteenth Century  (Auckland, 1996), pp. 76–85.  See also J. Belich,  Paradise Reforged: A History of the New Zealanders from the 1880s to  the Year 2000  (Auckland, 2001).
 Christian colonisation, were deeply influential in a way unmatched in  any other British settler colonies.
 The Sierra Leone   Company, established in 1791 with letters patent  but never really a fully commercial operation, enjoyed mixed fortunes  in which the highest religious and romantic idealism clashed with the  realities of colonial settlement in one of the most dangerous and disease- ridden places on earth. It was an empire-wide project that drew person- nel from all over the world to participate in a great social, political and  religious experiment. In 1792, Lieutenant John Clarkson   (1764–1828)  sailed to Nova Scotia with his party of former soldier colonists. The  expedition included 100 whites: Clarkson was governor, and Zachary  Macaulay (1768–1838) was the first superintendent. William Dawes    (1762–1836), an astronomer and naval draftsman who had travelled  with the First Fleet to the colony of Botany Bay in 1788, went to Sierra  Leone in 1792 and served several terms as governor.  4
 to justify the support of a port in East Africa with a significant English- speaking population than a philanthropic settlement in the middle of  nowhere.
 The story of the Sierra Leone   experiment has captured the imagi- nation of a good many historians since the pioneering history of  Christopher Fyfe  .  8   While Fyfe saw the achievements of the Creole  community of Sierra Leone as something worth celebrating,  9   many  have emphasised the failure of evangelical expectations in light of the  harsh economic realities of the colony. Catherine Hall   has contrasted  the sense of duty which took Zachary Macaulay   to Sierra Leone with  the evident distaste he felt for the fractious colonists he was required  to administer.  10   While the Evangelicals who administered the colony  endured the arduous conditions out of a combined sense of religious  and imperial duty, the colonists generally proved unwilling to behave  as dutiful Christians and demanded a say in their own governance.  The limited success of the experiment ensured that parliament was not  asked to give its approval to any other missionary gestures disguised as  commercial schemes of colonisation. Instead, the Sierra Leone colony  became incorporated into the wider plan that Evangelicals espoused  for the conversion, rather than the colonisation, of the world. By the  1830s, foreign missions rather than colonies came to be seen as the  highest good that could be promoted by sincere Christians. It is in the  light of these global ambitions that we need to interpret the opposition  of ‘Exeter Hall’ to commercial schemes for religious colonies in New  Zealand  .
 end of this section; my purpose here is to give a fresh account of reli- gious colonisation as much as possible from contemporary sources.  The New Zealand Company and the like-minded affiliates, the Otago  and Canterbury Associations, all of which were heavily infused with  Wakefield’s principles of systematic colonisation, were responsible for  the seeding of five settlements in New Zealand in the 1840s: Wellington,  Nelson and New Plymouth (1840–2) and Dunedin and Christchurch  (1848 and 1850).  13   Clergy were included among the settlers and were  sponsored by the different churches in cheerful insouciance of the pro- scriptions of the CMS. In the tumble of new settlements, there was little  likelihood that any one church would emerge to dominate the others.  George Augustus Selwyn  , the first Anglican bishop of New Zealand,  arrived in 1842, but attempts by his supporters to assert exclusive  rights of establishment for the Church of England were met by effect- ive Presbyterian and Nonconformist protests.  14   The following year, ‘an  ordinance for promoting the building of churches and providing for  the maintenance of ministers of religion’, without preference for the  Church of England, was passed.  15   New Zealand was effectively up for  grabs by parties of religious settlers. The first in line were members of  the Free Church of Scotland.
 century.  17   And, throughout the nineteenth century, Scots were enthusi- astically engaged in the missionary movement and were articulate in the  generation of schemes for the education, civilisation and organisation of  the empire. Africa in particular, where the Scottish Congregationalist    missionary David Livingstone (1813–73) made his reputation, could  be represented as ‘a kind of celestial Scotland’, as Michael Fry has  argued.  18   However, it was not until the Otago settlement that an expli- citly religious scheme was attempted by Scottish colonisers.
 Free Church of Scotland settlement of Otago, 1847
 As we saw in  Chapter 7 , the Colonial Committee of the Free Church  was quick to embrace Rennie and Cargill’s proposal. In May 1842, a  lay association of the Free Church was formed, with paid officers in 17     J. M. Bumstead, ‘Highland Emigration to the Island of St John and the Scottish  Catholic Church, 1769–1774’,  Dalhousie Review , 58 (1979), pp. 511–47.
 This statement was reprinted in the  New Zealand   Journal  and in the  pamphlet published in 1845 to promote the Otago settlement as a  ‘Scheme of the Colony of the Free Church of Scotland’.  23   It was an essen- tial lever in attracting investors and paying colonists to the scheme, but  for Burns it was much more than this. Free Church endorsement was  a way to vanquish the hated adversaries of the New Zealand Company  in the Colonial Office whose ears were perpetually tuned to the rival  missionary proposals of Anglican Evangelicals: ‘Who can tell’, wrote  Burns, ‘what new arrangements might be adopted by his Lordship in  the plenitude of his despotic authority over these fine islands – and the  Ch. Miss. Soc. and Ch. of England Puseyites pouring through Mr Jas  Stephen their own favourite projects in his ear.’  24   In contrast, he sug- gested that the Otago colony would be a bastion for the Reformed faith, 20     J.

 Perhaps it is not surprising that the settlers were so hard-headed about  their decision to emigrate, or that commercial and spiritual matters  were so thoroughly mixed in all its promotional literature. However, it  does beg the question as to what the religious legacy of the founding  settlement in Otago was for the later development of the province. At  this point it is important to stress how small the original colonising  party was and also how limited and short-lived its direct association  with the Free Church of Scotland. Led by Cargill, the  John Wickliffe   sailed from Gravesend on 24 November 1847, with 97 passengers 25     Burns to Cargill, 6 May 1845, cited by  ibid ., p. 204.     26     Letter from Captain William Cargill to Dr Aldcorn of Oban, London 1847, in  Free Church Colony at Otago in New Zealand , pp. 7–9, in McIntyre and Gardner, eds.,   Speeches and Documents , pp. 24–6.
 aboard. The  Philip Laing  sailed three days later from Greenock with 247   passengers. Burns and Cargill both came as settlers. Despite Cargill’s  dislike of ‘the little enemy’, as he liked to call members of the Church  of England,  30   only two-thirds of the original Otago settlers were Free  Church Presbyterians. A direct link to the Free Church of Scotland  Assembly was also short-lived, and the Lay Association survived only  until 1852 after which its affairs were wound up. As far as the religious  character of the settlement was concerned, this came to depend a good  deal on Burns. It was Burns who set his seal on the Free Church and  religious ideals of the colony, identifying them in his own writings with  the founding principles of Otago.  31   Other leaders in the association,  including Cargill, M’Glashan and Aldcorn, as well as some at least of  those who chose to emigrate, also forwarded the Free Church Gospel in  their correspondence. On the other hand, many of the settlers who set  out for Otago came from among the most hard-pressed classes of rural  Scottish society and they had little energy to spare for religion. From  his reading of the shipboard diaries of emigrants and the letters they  published when they reached Otago, McLintock concludes: They may have been ardent devotees of Wakefield’s philosophy of coloniza- tion, though indeed this is most unlikely; they may have been zealous Free  Churchmen, and this is in many cases probable; but it was primarily in an  endeavour to ameliorate their lot, to build afresh in a new country which knew  not the social evils of the old, that Otago’s first emigrants set forth from their  motherland late in 1847.  32
 Presbyterianism also left a physical imprint on Dunedin, repre- sented most strikingly by the First Church of Otago (1874), the city’s  main Presbyterian church, which was designed in high Gothic style  by Robert Arthur Lawson (1833–1902), a Scottish émigré architect.  Lawson also designed Knox Church in the same city. Moreover, the  distinctive Presbyterian communion season continued to be celebrated  in Otago long after such public communal religious observations were  in decline in the heart of the home church in Scotland.  36   Without  doubt, this was less because of the original Presbyterian ethos of the  Dunedin settlement but more a result of the continuing pull of the col- ony for later Presbyterian settlers who recognised it as a place that was  hospitable to Scots and which valued their institutions. The churches  in Scotland helped to perpetuate this, as Marjorie Harper has shown,  by sponsoring emigration in the twentieth century.  37   On balance, the  Otago  settlement can probably be called a highly successful experiment  in colonisation, but for reasons which have relatively little to do with  the religious convictions of its founders. The same conclusion can be  reached,  mutatis mutandis , for the second major religious colony to be  established in the south island of New Zealand  .
 John Robert Godley and the Canterbury  Association (1849) As we saw in the previous chapter, Wakefield’s argument in favour of a  moral or religious element in systematic colonisation struck a chord in 34     Carrothers,  Emigration , pp. 116–40.     35     Elder,  History of the Presbyterian Church ; W.

 many Christian hearts. But his most eminent convert – and the man  who secured him the kind of illustrious patrons he craved – was John  Robert Godley, the man whose statue stands in front of Christchurch  cathedral as the founder of Canterbury.  38   Born in Ireland and edu- cated at Christ Church College Oxford, Godley was a likeable Tory  who had many conservative friends in the high church party of the  Church of England, including a number who later became avowed  Tractarians. Godley first began publishing on social issues in 1842  after travelling to Europe and the United States. In his  Letters from  America  (1842),  39   he argued that the answer to British problems lay in  the regeneration of the traditional caring role of the governing aris- tocracy. He also gave his approval to a resurgent Church of England  taking up its mission as the custodian of the national Church in the  colonies. While Wakefield was clearly an influence on his thought,  Godley needs to be ranked with other reformers who responded to the  social and economic crisis of the 1840s including Richard Cobden,  Thomas Carlyle, Robert Peel, F. D. Maurice and Prince Albert  . Not  just the challenge of famine, but the Europe-wide revolutions of 1848  excited old fears of popular insurrection and the need for social elites  to defend their authority by demonstrating their utility to the sceptical  masses.
 While many agreed that large-scale emigration was the best solution  to intractable social problems, Godley’s distinctive contribution was in  his commitment to the special role of the Church of England. When the  Canterbury Association was founded on 21 March 1848, Godley was  the driving force which secured patronage from social-reforming con- servatives to the project. The 1848 prospectus included fifty names and  it was probably Godley whose charm and powers of persuasion ensured  the list included some of the most powerful and influential conserva- tive leaders in English society. Tracking the connections and influ- ence of what grew to become eighty-four members of the Canterbury  Association has been the loving duty of local historians in Christchurch  for generations and defies simple summary.  44   Perhaps the main point  to stress is that the membership of the Association crossed political and  church party boundaries. In the pamphlet advertising the first meet- ing of the Association in Ipswich on 13 November 1849, the meeting  was chaired by Samuel Hinds, who had recently been appointed bishop  of Norwich. John Bird Sumner, archbishop of Canterbury (1848–62),  became president, and the list of members included seven bishops and  senior clergy as well as the Secretary to the Society for the Propagation  of the Gospel, Ernest Hawkins. Ties of family, friendship, politics and  religion bound them all together in a dense interlocking network focused  on an ideal project – the generation of an Anglican settlement in New  Zealand  , which would be the culmination of the Christian imperialism  of a generation. The prosopographer Michael Blain, reflecting on the  tangled skeins of school, college, family, the military, commerce, pol- itics, influence and, of course, religion, that made up the membership  of the Canterbury Association, likened its eighty-four members to a  village, but, in the same sentence, emphasised that it was no village, but  rather an oligarchy that stretched from England and Ireland across the  empire. He suggested that motivations for joining the venture included  political ambition, romantic fantasy, military and imperialistic power,  commercial interests and a philosophical interest in the ideal of colonial  settlements.  45
 Christian commitment was, nevertheless, the primary bond which  linked the members of the Canterbury Association and, except for  Thomas Jackson (who was a Wesleyan Methodist) they were all members  of the Church of England. At a time of rising tensions between church  parties, the churchmanship of the Association was nevertheless quite  mixed and included Evangelicals, such as Sumner and Lord Ashley,  high churchmen such as Samuel Wilberforce, the reforming bishop of  Oxford, as well as Tractarians such as Richard Chenevix Trench and  Robert Wilberforce (who later converted to Catholicism). In his profile  of the Canterbury Association, Cookson lays stress on the social ide- alism of the project, which emerged in the wake of the debates about  the ‘condition of England’, a range of issues which included industrial  dislocation, the Chartist demand for greater access to the franchise  by working men, the great famine that afflicted Ireland and parts of  Scotland in the middle of the 1840s, and the fear sparked by the revo- lutions in Europe in 1848.  46   However, the members of the Canterbury  Association, with the sole exception of Godley, were not colonists.

 Assessments of the success or failure of the Canterbury settlement  began almost immediately. Indeed, the whole venture took place in a  blaze of publicity. The departures were minutely reported in  The Times ,  and celebrated with illustrations and accounts of the formal depar- ture ceremonies in the  Illustrated London News . The most sympathetic  view of the fortunes of the settlement was that of the  Colonial Church  Chronicle and Missionary Journal . This was published in the aftermath  of the establishment of the Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund   ‘by a few indi- viduals at some risk of loss, but without the possibility of profit’ with  any potential profits going to endowment of new bishoprics in the colo- nies. It appeared monthly, with 2,000 copies being sold at home and  in the colonies. It would appear to have become a commercial success,  if we are to believe the editorial of the second volume. One key to this  was the decision to embrace the issue of church-sponsored emigration  with reviews of prospective projects, including those to South Australia    and the Canterbury colony, correspondence advising how the Church  might best be able to assist the needs of migrants, and occasional adver- tisements for clergy who might be interested in taking up work in any of  the expanding colonies of the south.
 For the editor of the  Colonial Church Chronicle , there was a necessary  connection between the two great fields of endeavour in the British  empire, religion and colonisation, the subject of the first editorial art- icle of the new volume. Colonisation, it argued, was closely connected  with the propagation of the Gospel. And, because the ‘means and  opportunities’ of the English are so much greater than other nations,  it follows that they had much greater obligations to fulfil: ‘We have  commercial, and we ought to have religious, relations with every coun- try in the world.’  49   A direct connection is then made between the  call to convert the heathen, and the opportunities to plant colonies.  Colonisation, especially in Australia   and New Zealand  , was nothing  less than ‘a champion able to cope with the Goliath of heathenism’.  Indeed, with such aid, the conversion of the world would be appreciably  advanced: ‘If we could plant another England in the Antipodes, the task  would be incalculably easier.’  50   This analysis is especially interesting 49     ‘Systematic Colonization’,  Colonial Church Chronicle , 2 (1848), pp. 2–6.     50      Ibid ., p. 2.
 Support for Church (i.e. Anglican) colonisation also came from other  high church journals, such as the  Christian Remembrancer .  51   Reviewing  the  Canterbury Papers  (1850), a promotional volume produced by the  Canterbury Association, and the pamphlet  Hints on Church Colonization   (1850) by the Reverend James Cecil Wynter   (1807–77),  52   it makes a  call on the English nation to take up its mission as ‘the Christianizers  and civilizers of the globe’,  53   and for the Church to do its bit to prevent  the continued barbarous neglect of colonisation, as opposed to mere  emigration.
 It is evident that the Canterbury Association   came to mean different  things according to the preconceptions of its members and supporters.  At one extreme was Lord John Manners   (1818–1906), a member of  Disraeli’s ‘Young England’ set who favoured all things medieval, chiv- alric and romantic, from the restoration of Don Carlos to the throne of  Spain, to the foundation of Anglican sisterhoods   and the Gothic revival  in architecture. In 1841, in his ‘Memorial of Other Lands’ Manners  had hinted at the potential allure of other Englands, both those in the  past and those overseas: ‘Let wealth and commerce, laws and learning  die; but leave us still our old nobility.’  54   There is a certain mad romance  about this, besides an unthinking Toryism which was slowly dying out  in the wake of the 1832 Reform Bill. For Manners and his friends, the  Canterbury Association represented an opportunity to make a grand  chivalric gesture. He not only joined the Association but had been pre- sent on the East India docks to bid goodbye to the first pilgrims. In 1851,  Manners gave a rousing address on the history of colonisation in the  empire in which he described the Canterbury settlement as ‘the great  colonizing enterprise of the day’.  55   Manners supplied visionary enthu- siasm to endorse the scheme which he imagined to be the answer to all  the religious failures of the first British empire. After a lapse of some 51     Edited by William Scott, Francis Garden and James Bowling Mozley.     52     Blain, ‘Canterbury Association’, p. 93, notes that, on the strength of this pamphlet, Wynter was suggested for the proposed bishopric of Lyttelton.     53     ‘Art. VI’,  The Christian Remembrancer: A Quarterly Review , 9 (1850), p. 449.     54     J. J. R.

 centuries, he suggested, the New Zealand   experiment would redress  the lost opportunities squandered by England in the Americas. Quoting  standard Wakefieldian authority, he argued that the key to creating loyal  colonists was to ensure that there was a mixture of the classes, while  ensuring that the ruling classes and the Church of England were part  of the mix: ‘With all the elements of English social life harmoniously  blended together – with all the precautions which the united efforts of  thoughtful and practical minds could suggest – with religion not only  admitted as a feature of, but permeating the whole scheme – with a dis- tinct government and legislative body – if the Canterbury settlement  fails, its failure will be a clear proof that England has effectually lost the  art of colonization.’  56   Religion was the key to this new, more successful  experiment in colonisation.
 As shown in Table 12.1, the Canterbury census of 1857 reflects both  the English and the Anglican origins of the settlement. Out of a total  enumerated population of 6,230, 4,256, or 77.3 per cent, were returned  as English, and 4,455, or 76.5 per cent, as Church of England. It is  difficult to make a direct comparison with the standing of Anglicanism  in England, but, in the religious census of 1851, just 53 per cent of those  who attended morning services went to an Anglican church, whereas  almost 16 per cent went to a Wesleyan chapel.  59   This would seem to  indicate the Church of England was doing rather better than might be  expected against significant Wesleyan competition in the Canterbury  province. At 4 per cent, the Catholic population was also smaller than  might be expected, even with the reinforcements provided by the  presence of some French colonists at Akaroa.

 Church of England was no longer in a privileged position but shared  the same standing as other denominations. The colony, he noted, was  neither exclusively Anglican, nor a ‘hotbed of Tractarianism’  .  60   This  is particularly interesting in that it shows the extent to which the  distinctive Anglican and, to some extent, high church character of the  original Canterbury settlement was becoming something of a liability  as it sought to sustain its existence as a viable commercial colony.
 Lyttelton’s account of New Zealand   is a great curiosity. He clearly  wrote it himself based on extracts from his diaries, and he tries hard  to provide a balanced account of his experiences, neither exaggerat- ing his claims to expertise nor acting as the agent for emigrants who  might wish to visit the settlement. On the whole, he felt paternal about  Canterbury, which he calls ‘a cub of England’. He was intrigued, in  turn, by the New Zealanders’ assessment of himself: What the people mostly thought of us three I never much learned, though I  was very curious about it. Almost the only specific judgment I heard was that 60      Ibid ., p. 15.     61     See  Chapter 3 ; and Lyttelton,  Letter to Hawkins . At the same time, Lyttelton contrib- uted articles on the Canterbury colony and the colonial church. See L. Lyttelton,  ‘Canterbury Colony’,  Colonial Church Chronicle , 2 (1849); L. Lyttelton,  The Colonial  Empire of Great Britain Especially in Its Religious Aspect  (London, 1849).
 Besides the length of his sea voyage, Lyttelton seems to have been  chiefly repelled by the ethos of the Canterbury province which was  attempting to make commercial capital out of its association with the  Church of England. He was gratified that the original religious char- acter of the settlement seemed to have given Anglican institutions an  advantage over other churches. Overall, however, Lyttelton’s lecture  leaves the strong impression that he found the long expedition rather  boring and far more trouble than he anticipated. His verdict on the  prospects for the emigrant is relegated to a footnote: ‘fair success is as  nearly certain as anything human can be.’  68   This reflects a rather dis- mal realisation that, despite all its religious idealism, the Canterbury  settlement had become simply another venture in colonial land specula- tion. This was a bitter pill to swallow.
 On the surface, Butler’s class and education would seem to have   fitted him for the role of supporter – rather than satirist – of the pre- tensions of the Canterbury settlement. Butler was the son of a clergy- man and the grandson of a headmaster of Shrewsbury School, which he  attended before going to St John’s College, Cambridge.  71   After taking  his degree, he began preparation for ordination but seems to have expe- rienced something of a crisis of confidence in the Church of England  as much as a crisis of faith. At any event, his family supported his travel  to New Zealand   where he succeeded in reversing his fortunes in the  Anglican settlement of Canterbury. From 1860 to 1864, he successfully  developed a sheep station, which he called Mesopotamia, in the high  country to the south of the province. He was also successful in con- tributing to the budding cultural development of Christchurch, writing  some of his most effective pieces for the Christchurch  Press , as well as  the letters and journals which his family edited and published as  A First  Year in Canterbury Settlement  (1863). Although Butler sold his station  and returned to London, he continued to work on the fantasy satire,   Erewhon , which was ultimately published by Trübner in 1872.  72
 For gentlemen migrants, Canada was represented as a manly fron- tier, but one in which care was taken to plant and nurture British insti- tutions, including the churches. The promotional brochure for the  Edgeley Estate, Qu’Appelle Valley, on land purchased in May 1882  from the Canadian Pacific Railway, quotes from the report of Professor  Henry Tanner  , who had visited the valley in 1883. Tanner urged the  advantages of immigration to the Canadian North-West for ‘sons of  gentlemen’ who found their profession overstocked and thought to try  their hand at ranching. These sentiments were directed at anxious par- ents, who might be persuaded to bankroll their offspring in a colonial  adventure: ‘I would far sooner see my son a farmer, active on horse- back, making a little money and becoming independent before he was  thirty years of age, than sitting still in a lawyer’s office at home.’  85   With  a view to attracting the sporting gentleman, Tanner goes on to praise  the ‘excellent sport’ to be had around the land available for settlement,  including prairie chickens, partridges, plover, snipe and hares, as well  as lakes abounding in birds and fish. Beyond, there were hills with large  game: wapiti, moose, antelope and other kinds of deer, mountain sheep,  bear and buffalo. At the same time, the civilities of religion and culture  had not been forgotten, and Tanner reports cheerfully on the churches  springing up, complete with clergy and congregations ready to welcome  the respectable English newcomer.  86   As in the Canterbury colony, reli- gion was incorporated into the promotional literature of the land specu- lators, without any real intention to secure an established church, or  secure an exclusively denominational cast to the settlement.
 Barr (Britannia) Colony This scheme for the Qu’Appelle Valley was only a precursor to a more  comprehensive attempt to people the Canadian North-West with an  Anglican settlement, which would attempt to reproduce in the Canadian  prairie the most desirable features of English religious life. The scheme  was initiated by the Isaac M. Barr   (1847?–1937), Anglican curate of  Tollington Park who, with less than becoming modesty, gave it his  own name.  87   Barr’s prospectus made a direct appeal to British senti- ment, asserting with patriotic directness: ‘Let our cry be “CANADA    FOR THE BRITISH”.’  88   About 2,684 colonists responded to the call  and departed for Canada on the  SS Lake Manitoba  on 31 March 1903.  Local reports encouragingly reported that a good proportion of the col- onists were agriculturalists and, although the party included some sons  of clergymen, they had all been ‘hardened by cricket and football in the  public schools for a life of outdoor labor’.  89
 By linking their fortunes to the Church of England, the commercial  speculators behind the Britannia Colony acquired powerful allies who  shared their imperial vision of an Anglican utopia on the prairie. Henry  Hutchinson Montgomery, the Secretary of the SPG, was touched by  the challenge of rapid Canadian expansion and excited by the prospect  it opened up. He visited Canada and wrote up his experiences in a book  that promoted the Canadian North-West and its need for Anglican  clergy and resources using the language of empire and the cultural mis- sion of the British race. In the words of the bishop of Saskatchewan,  who is quoted by Montgomery: ‘The time past has been sufficient to  have neglected Canada. Here in this new Empire of white men spring- ing up upon the prairie we must haste to their aid.’  93   An additional fac- tor focusing the mind of the Secretary of the SPG   was rivalry with the  Colonial and Continental Church Society  . When Montgomery arrived  in Canada, he found that the Secretary of the CCCS was already on the  ground. They agreed that a mutual campaign, employing the resources  of both colonial missionary societies, was called for.  94
 The Canadian Catechists’ Mission to Saskatchewan  , also known  as the English Church Railway Mission, would be the last major pro- ject conducted by any colonial missionary society in a settler colony.  According to Hayes, this would be the ‘finest chapter in the Canadian  history’ of the CCCS.  95   A massive effort was made to raise the funds  necessary to support the chosen catechists in the field and outfit them  for a travelling mission that would follow the railway and plant preach- ing stations and churches along the route taken by the new settlers. The  catechists’ equipment included a buggy designed to roll along the cor- ridor created for the coming railway while the young men slept in tents  surrounded by their modest kit. The SPG and the CCCS appealed for at  least £20,000, later raised to £30,000, to support training and outfit for  catechists and funds to build churches. For personnel, Montgomery’s  main recruiting ground was the public schools where families were sup- portive of imperial ideals and had the funds to support one of their sons  on a ‘gap year’, to use a modern term, before training for a profession.

 As an exercise in the rapid deployment of a religious work force,  the Catechists’ Mission was a remarkable success. It was a military  operation for the delivery of spiritual goods to which General Booth  would have given his approval. However, it was also a temporary expe- dient which ultimately failed to secure more than a foothold for the  Church of England in the prairie landscape. It also came at the cost,  not acknowledged by Lloyd and his successors, of the CMS mission to  the native people of Saskatchewan. It seems to have been Lloyd who  attempted to evict the native catechists from ‘Emmanuel College’ and  replace them with the newly arrived catechists supplied by the English  church.  97   While settlers and their bishops averted their eyes, missionar- ies protested at the forced removal of their people under the direction of  the Minister for the Interior and the Indian Department of Ottawa. In  any event, the Anglican Britannia Colony and the Catechists’ Mission  would prove to be small gestures against the prevailing tide, which was  running away from the Englishness of the episcopalian tradition and  towards greater cultural diversity. When compared with the cultural  impact of the Canterbury settlement in New Zealand  , both the colony  and the Catechists’ Mission made little impact on the overall ethnic  and religious profile of Saskatchewan, let alone that of Canada   as a  whole.
 With the settlement of the Barr Colony, we come effectively to the final  days of the colonial missionary movement. Although the work of the  colonial missionary societies continued well into the twentieth century,  the mass migration of the British people had achieved its original pur- pose, and both colonies and the colonial churches had become self- governing. Colonial missions continued, but only at the margins of the  fully settled colonial empire, which was itself breaking apart into sep- arate nations. The churches, like all other imperial institutions, were  swept up in this movement. In the case of Sierra Leone  , what began as 96     See  Chapter 3 .    97     Montgomery,  Church on the Prairie , p. 50.
 Despite their undoubted idealism, the church colonies in New  Zealand   were not philanthropic or religious experiments but com- mercial ventures. In both the Free Church settlement of Otago and  the Anglican settlement of Canterbury, it is evident that religion and  commerce made for an unhappy mixture. Religious idealists, such as  Lyttelton found the colony he had founded with such high hopes to be  something of a disappointment. Harsher critics, such as Butler, found  it a prime target for satire. New Zealand historians have been debating  ever since about the significance of religion to the overall history of New  Zealand settlement. In the Britannia Colony, the commercial element –  and the inevitable spiritual discount on the ideals of its settlers – is  even more marked. In the latter case, religion served not simply to pro- mote a commercial scheme but was also deployed by Bishop Lloyd to  argue for a racially and religiously exclusive settlement of Canada.

 With the planting of the Barr Colony  , we come to the end of the colonial  missionary movement, or as much of it as can reasonably be covered in a  single book. Over the course of a century, the various churches and their  colonial missionary societies sent out their pioneers, planted churches,  squabbled with their rivals on the frontier and – finally – settled into the  landscape. As national churches emerged in place of the colonial seedlings,  the emigrant clergy who had spearheaded the movement began to do two  things: they organised imperial congresses that would help to celebrate  their achievements to the empire, and they wrote up their memoirs.
 As the colonial churches were filled slowly with personnel, the bish- ops and higher clergy were constantly on the move between colony and  metropole. Some journeys were professional requirements, such as that  which compelled Catholic archbishops who functioned as metropolitan  (leading bishop) of a province to return to Rome for consultation within  a year of their consecration. From 1867, Anglican bishops returned to  London for the Lambeth conferences  . However, in the last decade of  the nineteenth century – the heyday of imperialism – all the churches  began to meet in great ecumenical gatherings that drew their repre- sentatives back to Britain from outposts and colonial cities around the  world. For the British churches, these were effectively imperial meet- ings of the settler churches, since their membership was dominated  by British, American and colonial delegates. The first Protestants to  meet in this way were members of the World Evangelical Alliance  , who  gathered in Liverpool in 1845 and at irregular intervals in Europe and  the United States thereafter. Churches came to Britain to discuss their  institutional affairs for the same reason that other imperial organisations  were drawn there: London, the wealthiest, most populous and imperi- ous city in Europe, provided opportunities for pageantry, propaganda  and celebration that were available nowhere else. Missionary confer- ences   in the high Victorian age, as Cox points out,  1   were occasions on 1     Cox,  British Missionary Enterprise , p. 173.
 which missionary elites could meet and compare notes. However, this  ignores their other vital function, namely, to reinforce the connection  of the colonial churches and societies to the imperial metropole, and to  celebrate their emergence as world churches which had grown beyond  their British and colonial roots.
 Change was most evident for the Nonconformists. Baptists, Methodists  and Congregationalists had expanded so vigorously in America that its  British churches were beggars at the ecumenical table. Baptists   were  among the most proudly British of the colonial churches; however, they  were transformed by their expansion in both America and the colonies,  especially by the emergence of the Black Baptist churches which make  a striking feature of the first Baptist World Congress  , held in 1905.  Although the Congress was overwhelmingly dominated by English- speaking delegates from England and America, it was noted, with naïve  paternalism, that ‘the picturesque element was supplied by the negro  brethren, of whom about fifty were present, and who were cheered and  seen everywhere’. John Clifford, whose aspirations for Anglo-Saxon  union and God’s Greater Britain we encountered in the first pages of  this book, was a notable figure at the Baptist World Congress. Clearly,  there was an even more glorious union to be hoped for which would  include all races of men.
 By way of contrast with Nonconformists, Anglicans have remained  intimately associated with the territorial expansion of Greater Britain,  though only in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa did bishops  and their flocks achieve in any measure the authority and numbers of  the home church in England. Presbyterianism, another established 2     Methodist,  Proceedings of the Oecumenical Methodist Conference, Held in City Road  Chapel, London, September, 1881  (London, 1881).
 church in Great Britain, also did rather better in Greater Britain than  in America, especially in Canada and New Zealand; however, it also  gained from its older links with northern European Protestantism.  Finally, the expansion of Catholicism in the British empire reflects the  dramatic widening of opportunities made possible by the liberal reforms  of the mid-nineteenth century in Britain, as well as the success of the  expansionist papacy of Pius IX   and his successors. The international- ism of both Catholicism and Reformed Protestantism is reflected in the  way they ran their congresses.
 For the mission world, the 1890s was a decade of commemorations  as first the Baptists  , then the LMS   and the CMS, celebrated centenar- ies; there were bicentenaries for the SPCK   and the SPG. These older  Anglican missionary conferences were held separately from the meet- ings of the other missionary bodies which had met for the first time in  Liverpool in 1860. The Conference on World Missions had attracted  126 delegates, but it was dwarfed by the vast Centenary Conference  on World Missions  , which met in London in 1888 and attracted 1,600  delegates. The meeting which succeeded it, held in New York from 21  April to 1 May, was even grander: 200,000 attended the sessions which  attracted 500 speakers.  3   The last decade of the nineteenth century was  also a time for anniversaries and memorials in the colonies. In Australia,  the sense of a turning point, of colonies and churches coming of age,  was marked by a series of jubilees. The Melbourne diocese chose to  recognise 1897 as a fiftieth jubilee of the consecration of bishop Perry  ,  the first bishop of Victoria (1847), with the happy circumstance that  this coincided with the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. These anniversaries  were celebrated both in Britain and in her settler colonies where they  became occasions to mark the advance of the colonial churches within  the independent colonial democracies of Greater Britain  .
 The bicentenary of the SPG was celebrated in services that commenced  on 16 June 1900, the 199th anniversary of the granting of the Society’s  charter by William III, and continued throughout the year. Pascoe  notes that the final event of the Jubilee, a special service for children,  was rather thinly attended. The main body of the Anglican communion  participated with much more enthusiasm in what was arguably the  largest and most important of all missionary conferences and church  congresses of this era, the Pan-Anglican Congress of 1908.  4

 Nevertheless, unlike the 100th anniversary of the World Missionary  Congress   held in Edinburgh in 1910 which was commemorated with  considerable enthusiasm in 2010, the centenary of the Pan-Anglican  Congress   has come and gone with hardly an historical ripple. What this  signifies is the extent to which the colonial missionary movement, of  which it was arguably the high point, has withered away. The strength  and cohesion of that movement, especially for the Church of England,  has been the major theme of this book. However, the empire was not a  totalitarian structure for the churches, but rather a vehicle that made  their expansion possible in ways undreamt of by their founders. The  proceedings of the world meetings of these very different bodies pro- vides a fair indication of the extent to which most churches, from their  British origins, succeeded in escaping their bonds to become some- thing other than imperial dependencies. As the churches ceased to  be English, Irish, Scottish or even ‘British’ in character and, instead,  became nationalised and internationalised, their value as signifiers of  imperial identity changed. This is remarkable enough since, as we have  seen, almost all the colonial missionary societies made use of religious  nationalism and the language of imperialism in order to raise funds and  promote the colonial expansion of their separate churches. The dis- junction between the means of achieving this expansion, and their con- temporary standing detached from their imperial origins, may explain  why the colonial missionary movement has not been remembered in  the same way as the foreign missionary movement. In the twentieth  century, all the British churches would become detached from both  their national origins, and their transitory connection with the British  World, and become part of world Christianities, putting aside their  imperial past as rapidly as possible.  5
 Memoirs With the congresses, also came the colonial clergy memoirs. Like the  Pan-Anglican Congress of 1908, an event which has generally been  seen to look back to imperial Anglicanism rather than forward to the  ecumenical movement, many of these have become dated and lost their  audience. There are probably thousands of book-length accounts of lives  given in service to the colonial churches, and they arise in connection  with every congregation. This account will concentrate on Australian  clerical memoirs, many of which come from the unique collection 5     For the many changes this involved, see H. McLeod, ed.,  World Christianities c.1914– c.2000  (Cambridge, 2006).
 Biographical writing was the mainstay of all the missionary journals  and this heroic style formed a template for life-writing by retired mis- sionary clergy, who continued the tradition of writing for the combined  audience of potential contributors to missionary projects, and potential  future missionaries. More recently, this writing has been recycled to  meet the needs of the contemporary theological training schools. One  account of colonial missionaries in Australia  , written by the Deputy  Principal of the Theological Hall in Melbourne, was prepared for the  frankly stated purpose of providing models for current candidates for  the ministry of pastoral work from the past.  6   A similar motivation seems  to be behind the publication of Robert Withycombe’s   two collections  of excerpts from the ‘Occasional Papers’ of St Augustine’s College,  Canterbury.  7   The need for compilations of this kind began quite early,  8    and led to some heroic work of amateur prosopography. The Catholic  clergy were remembered in similar style through the researches of  Southerwood.  9   The self-promotional quality of this literature explains  why most were either self-published or distributed with a local, or inter- nal church, audience in mind.
 In biographies and memoirs, colonial clergy celebrated their lives  and countered the slur that they were second-raters, without the edu- cation or cultivation of the home-grown product. Between hard cov- ers they were reborn as apostles and martyrs, pioneers and church  planters, founding fathers and bush parsons. The earliest published  memoirs were as much emigration manuals as memoirs in the usual  sense.  10   The SPCK   published a collection of these under the title,  The  Emigrant and the Heathen .  11   This volume included the Reverend R. G.  Boodle’s   account of his ministry in the Hunter Valley region of New  South Wales, the Reverend R. J. Dundas on mission work in British  Columbia  , and shorter accounts of pastoral and mission work in New  Zealand  , Guiana, India and Burma, possibly with an eye to those who 6     G.

 Almost every colonial bishop was treated to a biography in heroic  mode, so we can only take a representative sampling of the genre here.  Bishops were especially admired for their role in touring the bounds  of their dioceses, mapping out the territory of a new spiritual colony  for the home church. Boodle, whose own memoirs have already been  mentioned (they were originally serialised in the (Anglican)  Parish  Magazine ),  20   wrote up the life of William Tyrrell  , the first bishop of  Newcastle in this style.  21   Like many a pioneering churchman, Tyrrell  was defined by his riding: long, hard and often, ‘an excellent horseman  he became, however little he had ridden in England’.  22   In the absence of  the railway, few men spent longer in the saddle than a colonial bishop.  George Alfred St Clair Donaldson   (1863–1935), Anglican bishop of  Brisbane, extolled the pleasures of episcopal visitation to remote sta- tions in the outback, declaring that ‘[t]he whole tour was to me one long  picnic’.  23   The bush itself, with its endless isolation, he saw as a pastoral  challenge and without romance.
 By this stage, the bishop and his clergy were already making the tran- sition from emigrants and pioneers to identification with the colonial  church.
 Anglican clergy might also be represented as British imperial- ists, whose religious calling was seen to be synonymous with that  of the extension of the Anglo-Saxon race  . For this last category of 18     A. M. Grocott,  Convicts, Clergymen and Churches: Attitudes of Convicts and Ex-Convicts  Towards the Churches and Clergy in New South Wales from 1788–1851  (Sydney, 1980),  p. 233.
 memorialist, the clergyman was a nation-builder as much as a builder  of churches. Archdeacon F. B. Boyce   wrote his memoirs late in life  and in the aftermath of the First World War, but he represents an ear- lier age, one in which the work of the Church was seen as intimately  involved in the development of the nation. In his first ecclesiastical  appointment, he remembers riding in the dark towards the outback  town of Bourke, failing to find a track that led to a homestead. ‘I had  constantly to stop and get off and strike a match down close to the road  to see whether I was still upon it.’  25   From this experience, Boyce came  eventually to be one of the major advocates of Empire Day in Australia  .  In more secular, anti-imperial literature, the bush parson   formed part  of an anti-clerical stereotype. The term was used by the Australian  poet, Henry Lawson  , for a character called ‘Stiffner’, proprietor of a  New Zealand   pub: ‘He’d been a spieler, fighting man, bush parson,  temperance preacher, and a policeman, and a commercial traveller,  and everything else that was damnable.’  26   Nevertheless, for many oth- ers it was a term that was earned and worn with pride. The ‘Bush  Brothers’   was the bold designation for the Anglican brotherhoods who  took up service in remote parts of inland Australia in the last dec- ades of the colonial missionary movement.  27   In 1899, the Methodist  writer, G. Warren Payne  , possibly in reaction to Lawson’s denigration  of the colonial parson, wrote a novel,  The Backblock’s Parson , which cel- ebrates the ‘wild free life of bush and plain’ of the itinerant Methodist  preacher.  28   Written under the pseudonym ‘Tom Bluegum’, this was a  rollicking bush adventure, complete with hard riding, encounters with  bushrangers and a parson hero who first rescues and then marries his  lady love in the outback.
 Clerical memoirs of all these kinds fulfilled a number of functions.  They justified the life of the person who wrote them, and they pro- vided an account of experiences which might be useful in attracting  new recruits to the colonial frontier. They were also reminders to the  imperial reading public that clergy, like other emigrants, were agents 25     F. B. Boyce,  Fourscore Years and Seven: The Memoirs of Archdeacon Boyce, for over  Sixty Years a Clergyman of the Church of England in New South Wales  (Sydney, 1934),  pp. 30–1.
 The first of these is the role of women   in the colonial mission- ary movement. In this account, I have mentioned only one woman,  Caroline Chisholm, in any detail, and I have referred briefly to the stra- tegic importance of the women’s auxiliary of the Colonial Committee  of the Free Church of Scotland to the success of its colonial ventures.  Yet, from other missionary studies, we know that women made up a sig- nificant proportion of those who worked as lay teachers and agents on  foreign mission fields; they also dominated the auxiliaries that funded  missionary work ‘at home’. I suspect that the same was true for women  and colonial missions. Hence, while I have had something to say about  colonial missionary societies and the colonial ministry, including the  training and despatch of Catholic and Anglican priests in England and  Ireland, much more needs to be said about the role of women and men  from the laity and the religious orders  . By staffing schools, hospitals  and other religious institutions across the empire, they made its explo- sive growth possible.
 The second important work that needs to be done will involve a  deeper study of archival records than has been possible within the con- straints of this book. The candidates’ records of the SPG, and – where  they have survived – the papers and correspondence of colonial mis- sionaries who applied to other societies, will repay full-length analysis.  Another important body of archives which await future researchers are  those of the colonial clergy who made applications to the archbishops  of Canterbury and York for licences to work in English dioceses of the  Church of England. Analysis of these records of individuals would help give a more human – and more spiritually idealistic – face to the colo- nial missionary movement than is reflected in official publications.
 Thirdly, I am strongly aware that the story in this book has been  told almost entirely from the point of view of the Christian churches  in Britain, and has leaned heavily on their published proceedings and  journals. However, for every letter sent from ‘home’, a recipient in the  colonies was deeply engaged in its reception and execution. Local stud- ies of the imperial connection, which should include the colonial church  journals which reported, from a colonial point of view, on the develop- ment of the churches, would add new volumes to this initial study, fill- ing the space between colonial missions and national churches.
 Finally, there is much more that needs to be said about the impact  of empire on the churches in the post-colonial age. The timeframe of  this book covers the nineteenth century, somewhat extended to include  the festival season of anniversaries, congresses and commemorations,  which continued until the 1908 Pan-Anglican Congress   – an event which  requires a book of its own to do it justice – and the 1910 Edinburgh  Missionary Congress. However, in many ways the imperial connec- tion lingered on well into the twentieth century and, indeed, has not  entirely faded, especially for Anglicans and Presbyterians, adherents of  Britain’s two formerly established national churches. Yet, the Christian  churches of the settler empire were, eventually, both nationalised and  internationalised. In the former colonies, they acquired organisations  and religious characteristics that increasingly owed less to empire and  more to the rising nations, with their independent legislatures and  constitutions, into which they had been planted. In the  process they  looked to the world and not back to Britain for religious union. The  collapse of the Nonconformist identity, which owed its existence to the   constitutional relationship of some Protestant churches to the British  state, and its evolution beyond the empire to the international evangel- icalism of today, is one reflection of this. The Catholic Church, which  in its British form was dominated by Ireland and an English elite, was  internationalised in its turn by twentieth-century emigration in the  former colonies. In all the settler churches, these processes led to the  fading of the  imperial religious connection that has been traced in  God’s  Empire .

 To what extent Richard’s claim to an “English” identity was acceptable to British readers in the early nineteenth century can perhaps best be fathomed by reviewing the historical events leading to Jewish emancipation.11 While the National Assembly in France had declared the emancipation of Jews in 1790–91, allowing them rights of full citizenship, Britain, in the first two decades of the nineteenth century, continued in slow pace towards resolving the Jewish issue. Todd Endelman points out that, although medieval views about Jews had lessened, anti-Semitism assumed a new guise in this era: During the early years of the parliamentary campaign for Jewish emanci- pation, Tory MPs voiced their objections in largely secular terms. They did not stress, as did their predecessors, that the Jews were blasphemers and deicides, but emphasized that they were a distinct people and thus could not be considered part of the English nation.

 This study argues that the British empire from 1780 to 1830  (and in some areas beyond)' represented not simply a hiatus between  the irresistible waves of liberal reform, but a series of attempts to  establish overseas despotisms which mirrored in many ways the  politics of neo-absolutism and the Holy Alliance of contemporary  Europe. These colonial despotisms were characterised by a form of  aristocratic military government supporting a viceregal autocracy, r  by a well-developed imperial style which emphasised hierarchy  and racial subordination, and by the . patronage of indigenous  landed elites. Of course, constitution-making for the dependencies  remained evolutionary and pragmatic; it rarely aspired to uniform- ity (Madden 1987: xxxiv-v). However, in the British tradition at  least, the formal statements of constitutions or colonial minutes  are a poor guide to real social and political change; there are  distinct limitations to history based on what men tell their lawyers  they are doing. If we consider the ideas which informed political  arrangements, the style and direction of policies and the social  context in which they operated, the argument for continuity  seems inappropriate. The era between American Independence  and the Great Reform Bill does indeed warrant its description  as a 'Second British Empire'. Similarly, the decline of this new  style of imperialism after 1830 had as much to do with indigenous  resistance and international economic crisis as with the triumph of  liberalism at home.
 The imperial dimension of the British state was equally important  in Ireland where between 1780 and 1830 an attempt was made to  modernise and purge the Protestant Ascendancy and assimilate the  Catholic gentry to a Greater Britain. But historical writing has been  straitjacketed by the 'English' and 'nationalist' views of Irish history.  English historiography tends to see Ireland as a 'problem' to be  solved by constitutional artangements such as the Act of Union of  1801. The extent to which Ireland was the colonial society where  the mechanics and ideology ofimperial rule were first implemented,  has often been glossed over. At the same time, nationalist historical  writing unduly neglects the critical role of the Irish within British  imperial expansion and equates nationalism with anti-imperialism.  This is an anachronism. Irish patriots were desperate to reap the  benefits of imperial expansion while Irish soldiers and savants were  in the front line of empire-building. In short, Irish nationalism arose  from Ireland's perceived exclusion from empire, not her inclusion  within it.
 INVERTED PATRIOTISM: THE CASE OF SCOTLAND Wales, the first English colony, had been shackled to London  since the Act of Union of 1536. In the eighteenth century its  thoughtlessly Anglocentric and Protestant elite filtered through  Oxford into London society Uones 1984: 46-50), while English  tradesmen and factors fanned out across the valleys. The incorpo- ration of Scotland and Ireland into this 'British Empire in Europe'  proceeded along similar paths. However, it was much more violent  and contentious, driven by fear of revolt from below as much as by  the desire for profit and status. The timing was also different. The  Scottish elite had already thrown in its lot with London in 1707; the  revolts of 1715 and 1745 confirmed their assimilation. The Irish  Protestants were to haver until the end of the century when they  were blown into legislative Union with Great Britain by Catholic  peasant revolt. Thus the consolidation of an imperial state both  inside and outside Europe depended on these three conditions: the  distribution of benefits from economic integration; the intensity of  revolt 'from below'; and the imminence of an external threat.
 Parochial economic and social conflicts arising from rapid  growth and a change in the nature of the economy during  the great upswing after 1730 provided one set of conditions for  relations between the Irish ruling class and the British empire.  Another dimension, however, was added by the constitutional and  political relations between the Irish elite and London. Up to 1790,  and most particularly during the period of 1782-4 when the Irish  volunteer movement was at its height, this establishment seemed  set to follow a path similar to that of the American colonists.  British control over the Irish Parliament (enshrined in Poyning's  Law of 1494) was deeply resented, particularly since Ireland was  restricted from full participation in the British colonial system,  while still being expected to pay for imperial defence through excise and other taxes. On this the Protestant gentry and the  Catholic middle class (itself disadvantaged by exclusion from  office under anti-Catholic disabilities) were at one. The crisis of the  American War of Independence allowed the Irish elite to demand  from Britain parliamentary independence and various concessions  in trade .
 This Irish political community showed some signs of cultural  assimilation before 1790. Agrarianist philosophy and a desire for  the 'improvement' of the Catholic peasantry brought Anglican,  Presbyterian and crypto-Catholic together in the vigorous literary  and debating world of Dublin . In the 1760s and 1770s some  Catholic gentry took to the practice of occasional conformity with  Anglicanism to gain access to public office (MacDonagh 1984: 23).  In local government, again, some Catholic gentry were admitted  to shares of patronage , while both Protestant and Catholic sought  service in the army of the East India Company, one division of  the imperial forces where religious affiliation was regarded with  indifference . All the same, the assimilation of the Catholic middle  class, it soon proved , was too little and too late . Only 10 per cent of  the subscriptions to the Bank of Ireland stock in the 1780s was in  Catholic hands; some decades after it was made legal for Catholics  to own land, there were remarkably few large Catholic estates (Lord  Sheffield 1785: 373) .
 The imperial principle also won out with ease in Wales. During the  1780s the Principality had spawned many radical cells, led by men  such as the dissenting minister, Richard Price. They drew on the  poverty of rural Wales and resentment at the economic and political  dominance of the small group of Anglo-Welsh gentry; they also saw  Welsh neglect by Parliament as part of a much wider, imperial  problem. The outbreak of the French wars, however, signalled a  rapid decline of old Welsh radicalism. Methodism had been the  most vigorously expanding faith in Wales in the later eighteenth  century. The Methodist leadership, now under suspicion of '.jacobin'  tendencies, rallied smartly to the state, becoming 'plus royaliste que  le roi'. John Elias taught his followers that it was their duty to  submit to authority, while Charles of Bala wrote his Welsh Methodists  Vindicated to celebrate their loyalty (Davies and Edwards 1939: 165).  Like the Scottish tradition, the Welsh language and literature had  already become a scholarly bauble for English writers and poets,  and its moral centre was probably Oxford not Aberystwyth Oones  1984: 46--9). Hereafter, Welsh dissent and nationalism became the  preserve of small groups of radicals in the new manufacturing  towns, Welsh emigres to North America and isolated romantic  bards.
 The Crown had evidently to play an important role, especially  in the empire. The wider Burkean formulation of the 'glories  of the British constitution' was inappropriate where indigenous  peoples were to be denied their own 'constitutions', and besides,  Burke's conservatism had displayed a strong anti-imperialist face,  at least as regards the East India Company. The established Church  might also be an important resource for state- and empire-building  but, again, there were problems. The accommodation of Protestant  Dissenters and Catholics raised difficult issues in Europe, while  direct evangelisation of Asians and Africans was suspect because  it might create 'mongrel' Christian races whose loyalty to the  Crown would be in doubt. During the generation after 1790  an uneasy compromise was evolved. On the one hand, the  Anglican Church was projected more forcefully outside England,  but mainly among people of British descent and their dependents,  or among people who were already Christian. For non-Christians,  the role of the Church was to be a glorious, but distant exemplar of national piety . On the other hand, the establishment delicately  encouraged the 'nationalisation' of Methodism and the Dissenting  Churches, whose prominent members already sought respectability  and distance from the earlier stigma of radicalism.
 The Protestant empire was also reinforced by the 'governing race'  principle which emphasised the fitness of Britons to rule by virtue  of their 'moral independency' and their understanding of the rule  of law; an institutionalised and philosophical racism thus became  an increasingly important part of the project . What has been called  here 'agrarian patriotism' was an outward manifestation of the right  to rule, and one which provided a serviceable unifying theory which  threatened fewer vested interests than the encouragement of free  trade. The divisions and contradictions with the plural British state  could also be submerged in the very acts of war and empire-building  themselves. Empire thus became a necessary component of British  nationalism in a way that it had never been central to English  patriotism.
 llO Nationalist display and viceregal ritual also became more  common in the colonies. After 1800, many new 'Crowy-colonies'  were created. Conquered territories such as Java or,,-Ceylon were  not annexed to the East India Company where the British Crown  had an ambiguous status. In possessions both old and new, public  ritual was designed to elevate the role of the governor and the Crown  over the still recalcitrant creole elites. For this a serviceable model  existed in the pageantry of the Viceregal Lodge in Dublin with its  formal levees and investitures of the Order of St Patrick. These  Irish ceremonies gave dignity to the annual ladling out of honours  and had been invented by administrations in the 1760s and 1770s  fighting to get their measures through the Irish Parliament.
 Once again, Ireland provided an interesting model. The fears  and hatreds engendered by the Catholic and peasant revolts which  flared up between 1796 and 1798 culminated in the emergence  of Protestant Orange movements with their aggressive martial  displays. In contrast to this, the viceroyalty seemed a relatively  benevolent force to many Catholics. In 1798 Earl Fitzmaurice  as lieutenant-governor pressed, but failed to win, the case for  their full emancipation and enfranchisement. In the 1820s Lord  Wellesley, who himself married a Catholic, voiced public hostility  to extreme Protestant claims and urged full Catholic assimilation  into political life (Brynn 1978: 84). Viceregal ritual, especially the  St Patrick's Day celebrations, achieved a degree of popular Catholic  support in Dublin during the years of the nineteenth century. The  new patriotism quickly enshrined its heroes, so that by the end of  the war, Nelson and Wellington, both the subject of fierce early  criticism, stood beside the royal pedestal, along with other minor  luminaries such as Rodney, and Wellesley who had built up a  coterie among Anglo-Indians even while some in Parliament were  still trying to prosecute him for war-mongering.
 Alongside the closer definition of both the nation and its foes  went the call to discipline and respectability. One powerful source of  this opinion was the growth of evangelical attitudes among Anglican  churchmen and the gentry which will be discussed below. Yet the  closer association of patriotism and right conduct deserves attention  here. The king, the nobility and leading members of the hierarchy  such as Beilby Porteus, Bishop of London, associated degeneracy  and immorality with political radicalism and regicide. During the  1790s a great variety of movements for the reform of public morals,  the suppression of drunkenness and the preservation of the Sabbath  emerged in the capital, sponsored and often supported by ministers.  Painfully slowly, attempts to reform the older universities which  had begun to occur in the 1770s and 1780s now gathered pace.  Tutors began to push for a university-wide examination system  in Cambridge and in 1801 the first Senate House Examinations  were held. This, they hoped, would impose patriotic discipline  on a student body which was felt to be restive and dissatisfied.  Several of the Heads of Colleges who instituted this move had  close contacts with Pitt's ministry. One wrote that his aim was to  reinforce the prestige of Church and university and to teach the  young to 'resist and refute the metaphysical subtleties which have thrown half of the , nations of Europe into confusion' (Rothblatt  1974: 286).
 In other parts of the empire, the active role of the state was,  however, much more in evidence. In Ireland the ruling class was  too scattered and culturally remote from the populace especially  in the south, for anything like the English JP system to work. The  electorate was kept small by anti-Catholic laws and the poverty of  the population so that local bodies were inadequate to share in  the tasks of regulation and taxation discharged by their English  equivalents. The state had to take a more direct role, and one  which, in theory, stood above the interests of the great Protestant  landowning families, the brewers, maltsters and linen-masters. The  shock delivered to the Anglo-Irish ruling elite in the 1780s, there- fore, engendered a movement towards reform or, more precisely,  towards state regulation. Administrative 'reform', moreover, was a  more acceptable response to crisis than any dallying with political  reform which might have threatened the Protestant Ascendancy .  The career of Sir J. Fitzpatrick (MacDonagh 1984) was born out  of this new spirit. His public services began with the control and  regulation of Irish charter schools (1785-7) and the scandalous  Irish prison service (the Irish Prisons Amendment Act, 1787).  Later, Fitzpatrick's concern for Irish soldiers serving in the imperial  army embroiled him in a campaign for the reform of conditions of  service for soldiers in England, and eventually drew his attention to  the regulation of convict ships sailing from Portsmouth. While little  change occurred in the fragmented army bureaucracy, Fitzpatrick's  initiatives did coincide with a more general movement towards  regulation. The need for this was impressed on the ministry after  the usual failures at the beginning of the Revolutionary Wars. The  Transport Board was created by order-in-council in 1794. The Alien  Office, designed to control refugees and 'seditionists', took shape in  1793-4, while a national system of royal mails began to operate in  1792.
 The imperial dimension of this should be stressed. Fitzpatrick achieved his entree into English administration through the good  offices of Lord Moira, one of the strongest advocates of patriotic  union between Britain and Ireland (MacDonagh 1984: 154-5).  Several other specialists, most notably the young Castlereagh  (prime minister, 1808-18), also had their first taste ofinterventionist  administration while serving Dublin Castle in the reforming 1780s  and the troubled 1790s. Later the Moira connection was to prove  one of the most important channels of administrative talent to India  and the Cape of Good Hope. Fitzpatrick himself had sonie dealings  with the East India Company when he attempted to set in motion  moves for the regulation of their large and badly maintained fleet  in 1796 (ibid.: 242).
 Over and above the accountable district official, who inherited  an awesome sense of natural fitness to govern from gentry  exemplars of the past, stood the 'Board', a body of semi-specialist  administrators and political appointees. The last few years of the  century saw a proliferation of the numbers and function of  such administrative boards both in Britain and the colonies.  In India the great increas~ of official business connected with  the reorganisation of Indian land revenue after I 793 expanded  the role of executive overseeing bodies such as the Boards of  Revenue which stood between collectors and distant or preoccupied  governors. These inquisitorial and supervisory bodies were meant to guard the new autocratic district officials from peculation and  old perquisites which were coming to be seen as corrupt. They  were firmly subordinated to the now more powerful governors. In  Britain, such new concentrations of specialist expertise had greater  executive power. Thus the Colonial Office itself developed quite  rapidly out of the Board of War and Colonies under the influence ,  of Lord Bathurst and a number of taxation and colonial experts  such as William Huskisson whose careers ran parallel to those of  their peers at the newly professionalised Treasury (Madden 1987:  26-30).
 In Ireland the Anglican clergy were not in such a good position  to act as the eyes and the ears of the new state; they had too much  on hand getting in their tithes and preventing their hayricks being  burnt out. All the same, agrarianism was seen as the natural policy  for imperial consolidation. An Essay on the Present State of Manners  and Education among the Lower Class of the People of Ireland and of the  Means of Improving Them ( 1799) urged that an Agricultural Board  should take a leading role in both the improvement of Irish  agriculture and educating peasant children in 'active industry', as 'religious bigotry' derived from ignorance and idleness. Moreover,  the government should try to 'engage the cooperation of catholic  ministers' in providing information and leadership on the model  of the Scottish clergy who had 'zealously' helped Sir John Sinclair.  The notion of associating Catholic priests with an imperial project  would appear bizarre even a generation later .
 THE IMPERIAL ELITE AND GENTRY RESURGENCE Politicians were now unusually well connected among the secular  and ecclesiastical intelligentsia. The influence of Adam Smith was  extended through the medium of improvers such as Sinclair and  Arthur Young. Wilberforce, Hannah Moore, Grant, Shore and  other Evangelicals were close to Pitt himself. This relationship  bloomed during the campaign against the slave trade and it extend- ed to other issues including Irish and colonial government. Pitt was  also connected with Anglican moral reformers in the hierarchy,  notably Beilby Porteus, Bishop of London, and with reforming  heads of Oxford and Cambridge colleges. Dundas's coterie, which  included Scots intellectuals and imperial administrators such as Wellesley and Macartney, ramified into the early Colonial Office  under Bathurst. The collective mentality of this governing circle  was Anglican and anti-Jacobin. It was fired with a sharper sense of  British national and imperial mission. It represented a conservative  philosophical cabal, as influential as that of Milner, Curzon and  Baring a century later, during another period of 'new imperialism'.  In the earlier eighteenth century only the Elder Pitt's war ministry  had been anything like this, and even then had lacked its cohesion  and long-term influence.
 THE CHURCH MILITANT, RACE AND LAW The last chapter considered the changes in institutions within  the British elite which gave form to the Second British Empire.  Even if there was no 'Regency Revolution in Government' there  was a considerable extension of the role of the state and its arms  of coercion, and this was particularly true of the peripheries of the  'British Empire in ~urope'. However, there was a much sharper  discontinuity between the 'first' and 'second' empires in the realm of  ideas and attitudes. Racial superiority was now more firmly inscribed  in institutions. This was a change which predated by some years the  full impact of evangelical and utilitarian ideas in the 1820s and  1830s, or of the Indian Mutiny of 1857, which many historians  have seen as turning points in the emergence of British racism.  Two other elements were also important. First, there was a growth of evangelical ideas within the established churches (Anglican, Church  of Ireland and Scottish Presbyterian). Secondly, agrarian patriots  who had once been hostile to empire took their message abroad.  The dominant ideological character of this Second British Empire  was aristocratic, autocratic and agrarianist. By contrast, free trade  and early 'liberal' ideas were much more characteristic of what might  be called the 'Third' Empire which emerged in 1830s and after.
 These currents of ideas did not, of course, sweep all before  them. Nor were actors on the political stage uniformly affected  by them. Many evangelicals were suspicious of colonial conquest;  a few even felt that the institution of slavery could be made  morally acceptable. On the other hand, there were imperial  proconsuls such as Mountstuart Elphinstone who remained pure  eighteenth-century deists; or royalists like Thomas Maitland who  were sceptics and 'pagans' . Rather, what happened was that public  discourse was powerfully influenced by the more strident rhetoric  of well-organised proponents of the new 'moral majoritarianism'  (Hilton 1988). Again, the prescriptions of evangelical thinkers  for Britain and for her dependencies might differ considerably.  People whose commitment to an individualistic moral rearmament  in English society was closely connected with their advocacy of free  trade and a distrust of paternalism, could be found arguing that  in the colonies, or even in Ireland, 'the state of society' warranted  benevolent British intervention in the market and indigenous  customs. Thus divisions between 'liberal Tories' and 'high Tories',  between dissenting evangelicals and conservative Anglicans, which  bulked large in England, often dissolved in the colonial context. To  this extent, colonial projects helped reinforce a national consensus  at home.
 There was a myth propagated by liberal historians of empire  that religion played only a small role in the British imperialism  which was a pragmatic construction of hardy entrepreneurs and  agnostic statesmen. By contrast, religious zeal was characterisitic  of the Iberians and French overseas. Though direct missionary  activity or forced conversion was rare indeed among the British, the  spirit of the revived empire of the Napoleonic Wars was throughly  infused with a kind of Anglican providentialism which acted more  or less subtly on policy. This helps to explain that though Crown  and Company preached religious neutrality, indigenous people,  non-Protestants and non-Anglicans almost everywhere feared  religious assimilation. Their reactions ranged from Catholic  nationalism in Ireland through Calvinist separatism in southern Africa to the fear of 'frankish' or unclean influences which inspired  the Vellore Mutiny of the Madras army in 1806.
 The view that British overseas dominion was the creation  of an Anglican Providence had often been voiced before, even  in the Bengal of the 1770s when the secular values of the  Enlightenment seemed dominant . The classical fear that empire  necessarily corrupted civic virtue through luxury and decadence  was already on the wane by the 1770s (Marshall 1981). Following  the growth of Methodism and the trauma of the French Revolution,  the link between evangelical Protestantism, nationalism and empire  was forged more strongly. There was a change of philosophical  perspective. Some Old Dissenters and Rational Dissenters (such as  Unitarians) had drifted from allegiance to the British Crown during  the American War and had denounced patriotism. Anglican radicals  such as Wyvill had preached the cause of the Americans and reform.
 After 1790, Unitarianism rapidly declined. Anglicans, Baptists  and Presbyterians all vigorously attacked 'unpatriotic' dissenters  such as Richard Price. Whereas the religious form of philosophic  individualism had tended to downgrade 'the affections', including  affection towards nation, the younger generation drew upon the  philosopher Hartley who argued that 'the constitution of the  human mind requires family affections and patriotism as necessary  preconditions of general benevolence'. Writers such as Wilberforce  or full-blooded Anglicans such as Burke and Coleridge seemed to  suggest that religion was integrally patriotic. For Coleridge, indeed,  national and social discipline seemed more important for the reli- gious life than individual struggle, and 'national unity is secured by  the Church'. The importance of private, philosophical judgement  was never completely rejected, but moral seriousness, godliness and  patriotism seemed ever more closely aligned (Stafford 1982: 385).
 This was largely a reaction to the growth of Methodism, which  was only later intensified by fear of French Jacobinism . For many  among the gentry and wealthier merchant class, Methodism was a  'state within a state', It was a sect which propagated itself by the  manipulation of family ties of affection, and one which might  undermine both the established Church and the Constitution.  This was because loyalty to country was essentially an extension  of affection to family. From this perspective, Wesley had become  almost a 'Romish Saint', while Methodists were now 'a distinct people  in the Empire, having their peculiar laws and manners, a hierarchy,  a costume, even a physiognomy of their own' (QR: 4, 1810, 480). So  a new Anglican patriotism had to be called into being because the legitimacy of the Church and the definition of nation as a religious  community was being contested in England for the first time since  the end of the Catholic challenge of the Pretenders in 1745.
 When the Methodists formally seceded from the Church  of England ( 1795) and spawned yet more advanced religious  opinions, concern about them grew. Their success in attracting  lower middle-class and labouring people, particularly in regions  distant from London, was also a source of suspicion for a ruling  class increasingly worried about popular unrest. The Methodists'  outwardly conservative political stance did not fully allay such fears.  Yet the first reaction from within the ruling class, the evangelical  movement, was almost as suspect as the Methodists in the eyes of  many Anglicans. Of course, Wilberforce's attempts to establish a  public godliness and sobriety, trumpeted in his A practical view of the  prevailing religious system of professed Christians in the higher and middle  cwsses of the country contrasted with real Christianity ( 1798), ran parallel  to the emerging orthodox Anglican movement which associated  ungodly living with political radicalism. Like them, Wilberforce  stressed the 'corruption of human nature' as contrasted with the  Enlightenment philosophers, and he bewailed the spread of vice  especially among the middle classes of the cities (Wilberforce 1798:  385). Like them, he also lauded 'the tendency of religion, and  especially of Christianity to promote the well-being of political  communities' (ibid.: 35). The problem was that the attitude of  Wilberforce and the Anglican evangelicals to the Church hierarchy  was ambiguous. Some Anglicans saw among them a dangerous sect,  another implicit challenge to the authority of priest and bishop.  What was needed, therefore, was a militant revival within the  Anglican communion, but one directed by bishops who were to be  the leading edge of an imperial moral rearmament. For this type  of Anglican, reform of the lower classes and the moral salvation of  the colonies were closely equated. They represented a break with  the eighteenth-century tradition of decentralised lay Anglicanism  which had seen the wider empire as little more than a bin-end of  ecclesiastical patronage.
 A key figure in the revitalisation movement within the Anglican  establishment was Beilby Porteus, a native of New England, who  was Bishop of London from 1786 to 1811. Porteus's support for the  relief of the political disabilities of Dissenters and Roman Catholics  brought him near to the position of Pitt, Wellesley and Dundas, who  favoured a policy of imperial 'assimilation'. Not all Methodists or  Anglican evangelicals were as tolerant of Catholicism. Porteus and his acolytes also favoured a moral revival within English society.  He opposed Sunday political debating societies which sprang up  in the 1780s and was struck by 'the increasing profligacy of the  times' (Hodgson 1821: i, 92). He was also active in the 'Society  for Enforcing the King's Proclamation against Immorality and  Profaneness'. Later some of his friends helped promote the  movement for a national educational system espousing Anglican  values (the National Society for Promoting the Education of the  Poor in the Principles of the Anglican Church).
 The emphasis in all these bodies was less on individual  redemption than on social control. London must be the crucible  of change because this was where the 'emissaries of infidelity were  most actively occupied in their work of mischief. Moral change  would come about not through sects and holy cabals but through  the reorganisation and centralisation of the Church itself. Porteus  attempted to establish a code for the Church in his Charge to the  Clergy (1794). He also tried to regain control over the appointment  of East India Company chaplains because of 'the importance of  religion in our eastern settlements' (Hodgson 1821: i, 146-7). As  a man of colonial origins himself, he worked hard in the cause  of the abolition of the slave trade and the cautious evangelisation  of the West Indian slaves. The method was to be one of godly  demonstration by a revived Anglican hierarchy in the Caribbean  over which the Bishop of London was to have much greater  influence. The Church, which had so far confined itself to  benevolent inactivity and distant encouragement of Moravian  and other continental Protestant missionaries, was now to be more  active. The civilisation and conver.sion of the 'negroes in the British  West Indian Islands' should begin with the Church's own trust  estates. Enlightened planters instructed by the king through the  Colonial Office would then initiate a scheme for the promotion of  Christianity among their own slaves. The newly-founded Anglican  Church Missionary Society would work cautiously and slowly in the  areas of British influence.
 The tone of Porteus's activities was typical of the establishment  version of the new Church militant. Like more radical Anglican  evangelicals of the Wilberforce connection and the luminaries  of the dissenting London Missionary Societies (founded 1795),  Porteus believed that the 'providential' destiny of the British  nation had been amply proved by the events of the French Wars.  As his intellectual successor, Claudius Buchanan, Chaplain to the  East India Company, put it, 'Great Britain unquestionably holds the place now which Rome formerly held, in regard to the power  and means of promoting Christian knowledge.' Why else indeed  should providence have saved Great Britain from the 'general wreck  of nations'? (Buchanan 1813: 11) Yet zeal was restrained by prudence. The great aim was to  strengthen the Christian witness of British citizens, particularly  those abroad, along with slaves and servants directly in their charge.  A secondary aim was to convert to Protestantism, Catholics, Syrian  and eastern Orthodox Christians or any of those who could be held  to have already been exposed to God's Word but in a perverted form.  The direct evangelisation of free, heathen peoples was another  matter. Many establishment evangelicals believed that education  and enlightenment must precede evangelisation and that Christian  demonstrations of godliness were more appropriate than the direct  assaults on the souls and affections of heathens approved by more  radical evangelicals. Buchanan's Colonial Ecclesiastical Establishments  summed up these views. The aim was to 'extend the national  Church'. There should be 'bishops in each of Great Britain's  principal provinces'; the universities should become active in  language and translation, and Anglican literary establishments  should be founded in all of the main sectors of the globe.  The location of these missions is of interest. The reclamation  of the planters and their charges in the West Indies was of  prime concern. A slow spread of evangelical thought had begun  among Anglicans connected with the West Indies following James  Ramsey's 'An Essay on the Treatment of African Slaves in the British  Sugar Islands' ( 1786). This argued that Christianity could prevent  'insurrections and murders' and undermine the bases of African  superstitions among the slaves. Buchanan added that 'Mulattos'  were to be saved 'because of their English descent'. The Anglican  establishment was slow to promote societies for more widespread  conversion, but the pressure of abolitionist opinion and periodic  slave revolts had begun to force movement by the early 1820s. In  Africa, Christian witness should be continued among the inhabitants  of Sierra Leone. This colony had been founded for trade . It was  also designed to evangelise the Dark Continent and remove from  the streets of London the thousands of 'negro beggars' who had  been released into them by Lord Mansfield's judgement of 1776,  freeing slaves in England. Commerce, religion and domestic social  control marched hand in hand.
 In Europe and the East, particular attention was to be paid to  Malta and the eastern Mediterranean because here the decay of the Romish Church was very clear; also to the ancient Christian  Churches and to the Jews ( often a target of Christian interest during  periods of providentialist revivalism). In India, Anglo-Indians and  the servants of East India Company officials were ripe for proper  conversion; but so also were the oriental English themselves, only  recently turning away from the dangers of 'brahminisation'.  Buchanan argued that it was particularly important to cement the  bonds with the Anglo-Indian, since if the United States had been  Anglican it would not have revolted against the Crown (Buchanan  1813: 112). Thus Buchanan's ecclesiastical establishments were to  be the frontier posts of a Christian empire.
 For this reason, early Anglican efforts in the East concentrated  on work among existing Christian communities and nominal Chris- tians. In southern and south-western India, attempts were macie to  reconvert Catholic Indian Christians perverted and 'led astray' not  only by Popery but also Hindu superstition. This culminated in the  efforts of John Munro, Resident and later .financial officer of the  Kingdom of Travancore, to seduce the ancient community of St  Thomas Christians from their Monophysite or 'Jacobite' allegiance  into the Anglican fold, a project which involved the Resident's personal intervention in Church matters (Bayly: forthcoming).  These efforts went alongside those of the more radical evangelicals  such as Charles Grant of the India Board of Control who influenced  the Company to send out godly chaplains, encouraged the building  of churches and tried to set a new pious standard of behaviour for  the once wild Company servants. In Ceylon meanwhile, nominal  Christians (those who had been 'converted' by the Dutch Company  in order to qualify for public office) were all provided with copies of  the works of Bishop Porteus with the blessing of the first governors  of the new Crown colony (Hodgson 1821: i, 281).
 Much has been written on the influences of Wilberforce and  the more advanced Anglican evangelicals or of Dissenters on the  moral and educational history of the British empire in the early  nineteenth century. What we have called here the establishment  evangelicals have emerged less clearly. Yet their influence on  the future tone of British imperialism was quite critical. They  had helped convert Anglicanism from the lay conformity of  mid-century into a national and imperial faith, but one which  was directed particularly to British nationals and their immediate  legal descendants by birth (people of mixed race) or by law (slaves).  Empire and national church were henceforth closely connected but  in a much more ambiguous way than was the case with the French  Catholic churches or the Portuguese Padroado (Crown patronage).
 Despite differences over 'colonisation' and the merits of direct  or indirect evangelisation of indigenous peoples, the patriotic and  nationalist tone of missionary work outside the fold of the establish- ment Anglicans was just as striking. In one sense, indeed, the dissent- ing churches, the Church of Scotland and the non-episcopalian  evangelicals became 'nationalised' through their activities in the  colonial mission field, dispelling the stigma of radicalism which  had arisen from their work among the lower classes in Britain. The  efforts of Wilberforce, Grant and their circle significantly increased  public pressure for intervention by Westminster against the colonial  assemblies of the West Indian islands which persistently sought to  frustrate attempts to evangelise the slaves on the ground that this  would increase rather than diminish the danger of slave revolts.  Unrelenting public scrutiny of efforts to suppress the slave trade  in West Africa and to monitor the treatment of slaves in the Cape  Colony set the agenda for Lord Bathurst's expanding bureaucracy  in the Colonial Office. At the same time, Methodist missions to the  South Seas appear to have borrowed their organisational skills from  the Royal Navy and the East India Company (QR: 3, 1809, 25).  Subscriptions were channelled into central holding organisation,  and the importance of settling the Polynesians to 'useful trades'  was emphasised, missionary ships set sail, amidst psalm singing,  under a missionary flag showing 'three doves argent in a purple  field bearing olive branches in their bills'. Methodists and radical  Anglicans also took their 'protestant' crusade to Ireland in the early  years of the nineteenth century. They abandoned an earlier  circumspection and directly attacked the 'Romish superstition' on  the grounds that it held the Irish peasant in thrall and encouraged  popular disaffection against the Crown (Bowen 1971).
 The connection between cultural assimilation within the United  Kingdom and evangelism as an imperial project is equally clear in  Scotland. Scottish Protestants had been sending missions to Gaelic  Catholics since the beginning of the eighteenth century . Towards its  end the influence of English Methodists and evangelicals prompted  a new wave of activity. Great Scottish ladies such as Lady Maxwell,  Lady Glenarchy and the Countess of Leven promoted Sunday Schools and the Edinburgh Tract Society in the 1770s and  1780s (Mathieson 1916: 51 ). Later, John Alexander Haldane,  captain in the East India Company's marine, joined Simeon, a  Cambridge divine, and toured through Fife and the Highlands  in 1796 distributing tracts; in the following year they visited the  west of Scotland founding Sunday Schools. After 1797 the effort  gathered momentum with the distribution of 27,000 tracts in the  Orkneys (ibid.: 63-4).
 Several prominent people in these movements had east or west  India connections, although at this time the dominant Moderates of  the Church of Scotland had little time for Asian missions. William  Carey, a Baptist and one of Bengal's most important missionaries,  was denied help in 1797 (he began work instead in 1800 under the  aegis of Danish missionaries in Serampore, Bengal). However, an  interesting indication of the growing national and imperial consen- sus was the later rapprochement between the once-radical Bengal  missionaries and the Wellesley circle. In 1799 Carey had dropped  the 'teachings of the French' for 'things of greater consequence'  (Potts 1967: 171 ). This paved the way for Carey and his comperes  to become involved with language teaching at Wellesley's new  Fort William College. Meanwhile, the ideology of the Church  of Scotland was itself changing. Many moderate churchmen had  argued in an enlightenment philosophical tradition that secular  learning and 'civilisation' must precede conversion. After 1815,  however, the growth of pietism and the conviction of Britain's  providential mission broke the dam (Mathieson 1916: 272). The  French Revolution had eroded faith in Natural Philosophy, and  Scottish churchmen like their English counterparts began to  emphasise Faith. Nor did they wish to lose out in the explosion  of evangelical activity (Hetherington 1843: 227-8). A great tide of  missionary experience and zeal was unleashed in the East, notably  in Dr Duffs Indian mission. It was now urged that the Hindu soul  could make a quantum leap to Grace through an intuitive grasp of  the meaning of the Gospel. Church of Scotland missionaries were  equally important on the Cape of Good Hope. Their leaning towards  Calvinism made it easier for them to adjust to the inheritance of the  Dutch Reformed Church. Yet their settlements among runaway  slaves and Hottentots played an important part in constructing a  network of specifically British mission stations outside the control of  the Cape Dutch farmers, and at times that of the colonial authorities  themselves.
 Protestant missionary activity, then, was an important aspect of the creation of a British nationalism. Attempts at cultural and  religious assimilation were intended not only to hold out salvation  but also to create a pious and united Protestant empire through  the distribution of tracts or the founding of schools. The stimulus  to these changes in Europe and outside was in large measure fear  of rapid social change. Lower-class sedition, the 'rise and progress  of popular disaffection', inspired attempts to reform the morals of  the London populace, just as Anglican schools in rural Ireland and  Presbyterian Bible centres in the Highlands were an answer to  the problem of the Celtic Catholic peasantry. Even in overseas  settlements, evangelising and the strengthening of the forces  of law and order were often directed not so much towards  indigenous peoples as towards disciplining the European and  Eurasian or Eurafrican underclasses which were developing in the  major imperial centres. The inhabitants of Madras, for instance, had  decided to found a Protestant Orphanage to reclaim the illegitimate  children of European military 'who are thought to number many  thousands' well before large-scale missionary activity got under way  in the Company's territories. The colonial establishment feared  that such people might otherwise become agents of sedition for  the European Catholic or Indian powers. Similar movements were  afoot before the tum of the century in British Cape Town and the  Caribbean islands.
 During these years the state also developed important new tools  for control and intervention in England, but more particularly in  Scotland, Ireland and the colonies. A revivified army, a political  and financial bureaucracy and a series of boards of control. The  state knew more and acted more, whether it was preparing statistics  of occupation in Scotland, revenue in India or slave-holding in the  new World. The disasters of the American War had produced an  interlocking network of parliamentary committees with their own  experts; so administrations also had to know more and be better  prepared.
 The important point here is that popular movements which  arose during the climax of the revolutionary period did not  simply respond to the promptings of elite initiatives; they also limited and formed those policies. The doctrine of political  assimilation of Catholic gentry and merchants advocated by  many of Pitt's followers, and later by Wellesley during his period  as lieutenant-governor, foundered not only because the Crown  and factions in England impeded emancipation, but also because  a broader-based but as yet unorganised peasant nationalism began  to emerge. The Catholic hierarchy itself was drawn willy-nilly into  re-emphasising Catholic pietism and open political activity before  the second decade of the nineteenth century.
 THE PROCONSULAR REGIMES The colonial regimes of the early nineteenth century were broadly  compatible with this society. Rather than being a despotic appendage  to a liberal, free-trading industrial state waiting breathlessly for  domestic and colonial reform, they mirrored and reinforced it in  important respects. Despite the emergence of a more intrusive and  centralising Colonial Office (and the growth of the role of the home  secretary in Irish policy) this empire was only loosely controlled from  the centre. The new Colonial Office, for all its incipient Benthamite  principles, was politically weak, understaffed and obsessed with the  problem of slavery or, more precisely, with the question of how  to make more acceptable at home one particular legal form of  unfreedom in the colonies. Colonial governors and their deputies  had a very free rein on most other issues. Up to 1815 or even  1825, they could cite exigencies of war as an excuse for a personal  and often despotic style of rule. War against the French or against  indigenous opponents of British expansion, Maratha, Burmese,  Sinhalese, Malay or Xhosa, could justify much. The prevailing ethos  of loyalism, royalism and aristocratic military virtue provided them  with charisma, dash and a ready supply of gentlemen, often younger sons of landowners, prepared to operate as their clients in return for  substantial salaries. Fear and loathing of republicanism and disdain  for the non-white, non-Anglo-Saxon, or non-Protestant, reinforced  by the fashionable aristocratic evangelicalism, helped inform their  mentality.
 Although these revivified colonial regimes rooted themselves  in starkly differing societies, they had common features and  comparable results. In general the new viceroys abolished or  eroded the powers of existing representative institutions and tried  to create an official class separated from the lures of commerce or  entanglement with 'native' life. The new official class benefited,  however, from massive salaries and sometimes from patronage in  Crown lands. The existing loose racial hierarchies were purged of  direct and irresponsible violence against slaves (wherever possible),  but defined more subtly through law; indigenous peoples (even  white non-Protestants) were excluded from office. Indigenous and  settler landlords were rewarded as far as possible through the  creation of untrammelled property rights to the detriment of  common rights and shifting tenures, but large concentrations of power were avoided when these were not in the hands of officials.  A 'yeoman' solution was particularly favoured where the Scottish  school of 'moral independency' held sway. Some moves to free  trade were put in train, but monopolies were often maintained  on pragmatic grounds and forms of coercion of labour apart  from abject slavery were vigorously employed. Finally, a subtle  anglicisation and, where possible, anglicanisation was in the air.  Direct proselytisation by missionaries (especially those of lower  class) was frowned upon, .but the English gentlemen and Scottish  public servants tried to inoculate these societies with Church and  the supremacy of law.
 IRELAND AND THE MEDITERRANEAN Naturally, it was in Ireland that the viceregal style of government  came under greatest pressure from the tendency to centralise in  Westminster. Yet the lieutenant-governor, or viceroy, under the  Crown still retained considerable powers. Until 1815 he held the  position of commander-in-chief, and with the growth of British  military and para-military forces in the country between 1816  and 1825, lieutenant-governors were often able to influence the  day-to-day deployment of the coercive power of the state. Until  the 1830s the Irish chief-secretary in London also helped to shield  the lieutenant-governor from interference by the British home  secretary. Several of these still-independent viceroys of the early  nineteenth century attempted to use their authority to cut back  the pretensions of the magnates of the Protestant Ascendancy and  to coax the Catholic gentry and merchant classes into the imperial  project. Wellesley-Pole openly espoused the cause of Catholic  emancipation after 1812; his brother Richard Wellesley married  a Catholic and tried to extend his patronage powers in order to  honour Catholics and exclude extremist Protestant Orangemen  from office (Brynn 1978: 51, 84) . . Trinity College Dublin was  quietly encouraged in its role as an 'imperial academy' and the  officially sponsored St Patrick's Day celebrations and rituals of  the Order of St Patrick were a conscious attempt to nurture a  conservative Irish patriotism within the empire similar to that  which was already paying dividends in Scotland and Wales (Hill  1984).
 Several early governors and senior civil servants on the Cape  had Indian experience, notably Lord Macartney and Sir John  Cradock. The tone of their administrations and the nature of  their concerns was reminiscent of that of Cornwallis's India. The  military element was strong. In 1810 there were 6,500 British troops  on the Cape, more than at Gibraltar or Malta, in addition to the large  para-military force of Dutch and their Hottentot servants which  were at the disposal of rural officers known as field-cornets. Even  though the first British administration ( 1796--1803) worked on the  assumption that the colony would be handed back to the Dutch, they  acted more purposefully than the Dutch Company had done against  both white and black dissidence. The settlers of Graaff Reinet in the  eastern Cape who harboured notions of republican independence  were swiftly brought to book, and jacobinism' was suppressed.  Xhosa incursions against the Cape colony were vigorously repulsed Proconsul.ar Despotisms: the British Emp;,re, c. 1800-40
 The evangelical Christianity of the Anglican establishment and  the Church of Scotland played a role in the formation of this British  order on the Cape, well before non-conformist influences became  stronger in the later 1820s. Since the Khoikoi and slaves were  already formal Christians or dependents of Europeans, there was  none of the reluctance to proselytise evident among officers in Asia.  Caledon in particular was keen to employ mission agencies whether  Dutch or British in the settlement of the expanding frontier. He  wrote to Castlereagh about the efforts of the Moravians: 'By the  exertions of the missionaries, the wandering natives are formed  into ... societies and taught by labour to supply their wants, whilst  the Hottentot soldier, formerly without a feeling of religion knows  the nature of an oath and appreciates its value' (PRO: CO 48/2, 4  Feb. 1808). There was no vigorous attempt to impose Anglicanism  on the Dutch population, and Church of Scotland missionaries  from a related Calvinist background played a prominent part in  British religious efforts. Still, the introduction of Anglican services,  English language, laws and schools created a subtle apex to the  social hierarchy of southern Africa from which the Dutch were, or  felt themselves to be, excluded. This perception of exclusion was of  some importance in stimulating the slow development of separatist  feeling among the Boers of.the interior.
 CANADA, AUSTRALIA AND THE CARIBBEAN Government at the Cape was an example of the classic dilemma  of an early imperial state trying to control the expansion of  'settler capitalism'. It bears comparison with the problems facing  contemporary British governors in western Canada where the fur  and logging economy was racing forward into Indian lands; and was  to have later parallels in Australia and New Zealand. It is only one of  a series of issues common to different parts of the early nineteenth- century empire. Religious conformity was another. By comparison  with the Cape where the Dutch Reformed Church was seen as a  tetchy ally in settlement, or the Mediterranean and Ireland where  Anglican evangelisation was limited by fear of Catholic reponse,  Canada saw a much more vigorous holding operation by English  episcopalians during these years. The Church had been endowed  with lands by the Constitution Act of 1791 and considerable  funds continued to pour in from England until the 1820s. SPG  missionaries taught in new schools which had been established  after 1 790 in the eastern provinces. They also found a base in  institutions such as the King's College of Nova Scotia, chartered  in 1802 and the empire's first university, or King's College of New  Brunswick which received its charter in 1829. The more vigorous  face of Anglicanism here reflected an imminent danger from the  secular United States. It was also an extension of the establishment's conquest of the Scottish Highlands in the previous generation, for  the communities particularly targeted for 'conversion' were Catholic  Highlanders such as those of Antigonish. The British tried to build  up a hereditary landlord and office-holding class to maintain this  Anglican settlement. The policy was supported by rising land prices  and the soaring value of timber resources which were maintained  at an artificially high rate by the huge tariffs levied on Baltic and  other non-British produce, even after the end of the war. On the  other hand, the attempts of governors to limit free constitutions  were less successful in these older colonies where a degree of  local representation had been built into their very foundations .  Sir James Craig as Governor suspended the assembly of Lower  Canada in 1807, but he and his colleagues were faced by a growing  and restive middle class of Francophone and Anglophone lawyers  and merchants.
 The Colonial Office responded vigorously, alarmed by the  precedent of the naval mutiny at Spithead and the Nore in  1796 and the pervasive atmosphere of republican libertarianism.  Lachlan Macquarie, the farmer 's son from Mull, was sent out to  quell the mutiny. He disbanded the NSW Corps and created his  own despotism through his complete control of all state offices.  In Macquarie's 'lairdship' there was nothing other than 'my reign ', 'my government' and 'my laws'. His policy also had a positive side.  He abandoned state tenures and tried to create an Australasian  'yeomanry'. He expanded trade with the Pacific Islands, and  surreptitiously with India. He rigorously controlled grain prices  through the government Commissariat, built Anglican churches  and schools. Macquarie, in fact, unleashed the policy which had  guaranteed the assimilation of the Highlands of Scotland a  generation earlier. His rule reflected not so much a long-term plan  evolved in London as a vigorous response to mutiny on the 'settler  frontier' (Ritchie 1986).
 It will be clear that the political arrangements and policies  operated in all these colonies were not simply examples of British  pragmatism or 'muddling through'. Though never planned from  the centre, they were enforced by similar military despotisms,  informed by similar autocratic ideals, and directed against  widespread and interlinked manifestations of social crisis.
 Yet there was one further general condition which linked the  political system in England with the form of colonial government.  That was the expansion of empire as a form of patronage  in office. Despite the controls introduced in the 1780s, Pitt's Proconsu/,ar Despotisms: the British Empire, c. 1800-40
 Different as were the forms of production in the Caribbean,  similar processes of social involution could be seen at work here also.  Ironically, the ending of the slave trade had the effect of curtailing  the movement of slaves into free society. The rising value of slaves  on the market and the inclination of the white owners acted against  manumission. And in conditions of depression in the plantation  sector during the 1820s, few black slaves could buy their own  freedom (Smith 1965: 101 ). The limited changes in the status of free  blacks and coloureds introduced by the autocratic governors and  other metropolitan influences had subtly increased the gradations  of rank within non-white society. White society had also changed.  One observer noted that in the 1780s 'the only distinction of ranks  consisted in white, coloured and negro persons' and blacksmiths  could be found at the white balls. But now 'there is a sufficient  number of secondary rank among the white people to form a society  among themselves', and one which mirrored the social order of the  motherland (Carmichael 1833: I, 18). The influence of Methodism  and revived Anglicanism along with the closer communications with  London had encouraged this involution of social rank. As ownership  of the plantations became less profitable, slave ownership and social rank became values in themselves, so that the effect of 'reform' and  metropolitan influence was to reinforce the caste-like nature of the  colonial society, not to undermine it.
 Most important of all, resistance in England to Catholic political  emancipation until 1829 wasted the political capital which had  been generated by Pitt's policy of political assimilation through  the Union, just as it rendered useless the policies of reconcilation  with Catholic gentry followed by successive viceroys. The imbalance  of political and economic power between Anglo-Irish and Celtic  society became confounded with the religious suspicion between  Protestant and Catholic. The lines were not yet hard drawn, but  in Daniel O'Connell's movement for emancipation and against the  Union, all the elements of Catholicism, gentry patriotism and rural  defence against the outside were coming together . The abolition  of anti-Catholic penal laws in 1829 was seen as a victory for mass  agitation and an acknowledgement of the ability of the Catholic  majority to make Ireland ungovernable if their aspirations were  thwarted. Since it was wrested from Britain and the Protestant Ascendancy by threat, rather than a concession made in the spirit of  reason and justice, it was bound to throw doubt on the future of the  Union itself. By the mid-1830s, the Young Ireland movement had  begun to sow the seeds of a revolutionary Catholic republicanism. So  it was the naked incompleteness of Pitt's policy of assimilation which  presaged its failure from the beginning (Beckett 1981: 304-5) .
 It has been useful to caricature the liberal Anglican view (as  Ronald Robinson calls it), and its unlikely bedfellows, Robinson  and Gallagher, because myths, after all, are part-truths. For much of  imperial history including, as we have seen, much of the eighteenth  century, colonial policy was indeed reactive and pragmatic, seeking  to pre-empt rather than to colonise and, above all, to save money.
 This book has traced some of the institutions and ideologies  which flourished in Pitt's Britain and were then modified and  exported to the new empire. These ideologies and institutions  were, of course, buckled and compromised by the conditions of  the societies into which they were introduced. But even if the  consequences of their introduction were often unintended, the  impulse cannot be ignored, for they affected not only Europeans  overseas, but also the particular histories of African, Asian and  American societies. 'Economical reform' of corrupt government  reinforced the financial basis of the state in Great Britain and  Ireland; its parallel in Asia and Africa was the creation of a new  administrative corps d'elite separated from European tradesmen  and 'native depravity'. 'Agrarian patriotism' and its paraphernalia  of statistical surveys and improving landlords was exported both in its English and Scottish form to the colonies where it had great  influence even though buckled by the pressur~s of indigenous  social change. 'Anti-slavery' and the missionary projects of both  the Anglican and Scottish Churches embraced attempts to discipline  and settle which were formative influences on colonial societies even  though direct proselytisation and assimilation were much less overt  than in the case of the Catholic powers.

 In the years before the French Revolution, in spite of the dark shadows, a few of which we have suggested, we can feel fresh winds blowing, and if it had not been for that cataclysm, the history of England and the Empire might have been quite different. The Revolution, in fact, did not come, as is often considered, at the end of an intolerable period. Reform had been in the air for many years both on the Continent and Britain. It had been the Tory Parliament of Lord North which had carried out Howard's prison reforms and, in spite of the ghastly game laws and other blots or blind spots in the English social legislation and outlook, there was a growing sense of social responsibility and of tolerance, as wit- nessed by the Act of 1779 which released Nonconformist ministers from subscribing to the Thirty-nine Articles of the established Church.
 Only minor concessions had been secured when Pitt badly bun- gled the situation by appointing Lord Fitzwilliam as Lord-Lieu- tenant to remedy conditions and then recalling him when he began to do so. Not only was the King opposed to any concessions to the Catholics or Dissenters but so were the English people generally under the reaction from events across the Channel. Grattan's elo- quent speeches in favor of Catholic emancipation fell on deaf cars, and the recall of Fitzwilliam seemed to end all hope* Both the religious question and that of the land cried to heaven to be set- tled with some fairness to the Irish, and when it was obvious that nothing would be done, violence began to spread in the unhappy isle. The United Irishmen, although Presbyterian in origin, joined with the Catholics, and in 1796 invited the French to come over and help them establish an independent republic. The failure of the expedition has already been noted, and a minor subsequent attempt wavs no more successful. Conditions, how- ever, were so intolerable that rebellion against England as repre- sented by the local government broke out. Much of the Irish vio- lence was directed against the Protestants, as alien to Irish civ- ilization, and the revolt against England developed into virtually ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS a religious civil war. Hangings, burnings, shootings, the massacre of priests, and brutality of all sorts were the order of the day. The new Lord-Lieutenant, Lord Cornwallis, admitted himself power- less. The situation was intolerable, but the Irish Parliament, though it did not represent the Irish people, could be bought for cash.
 Although the Old Tories were in control, two reform measures were carried out by the Wellington-Peel Ministry. By the repeal of the Test Acts in 1828 the Dissenters were freed from the po- litical disabilities with which they had been burdened for nearly 8?
 a hundred and seventy years, though Catholic Emancipation was still opposed. The other, which has been of inestimable benefit and added two words to the language, was the creation of our modern metropolitan police force. Inaugurated by Sir Robert Peel, the men have, because of his own name, since been known as "Peelers" or more commonly and affectionately as "Bobbies." The humor, kind- liness and efficiency of the London "Bobby" is known the world over. He has not only become one of the most typical of British institutions but has rendered incalculable service to government and society. With these two measures the reforms ended tempo- rarily, for the uneasy unity of the Old Tories was soon to be split wide by the problem of Ireland and the Catholics, which will be better considered in the next chapter, along with Parliamentary Reform.
 In 1833 also began the system o national education, although, like other beginnings, it was wholly inadequate. The established Church had practical control of all education. Dissenters were ex- cluded from Oxford and Cambridge, and therefore established the non-residential University College in London, which later became a model for many of the newer provincial universities in the latter part of the century. It was an event of great importance, but even more so was the grant in 1 833 of the sum of 20,000 by the government to two private societies, one supported by the Church and the other by Dissenters, which had been founding schools based on new ideas) This public aid, which has been stead- ily and enormously increased ever since^ followed in a half dozen years by the formation of what developed into the present Depart- ment of Education, was the beginning of real public education in England in the American sense as contrasted with what the Eng- lish call "public schools" but which are in reality private and fre- quently, as in the case of Eton, Harrow and other notable institu- tions, very exclusive and costly. For the smaller private boarding schools of the worst type we have to turn to Dickens, as for so much else relating to the evil aspects of English life in the next few decades.
 iThere was another great change, in the field of religion, which, added to the Evangelical movement spoken of earlier, was to have marked effects on life throughout the Empire. In 1 833 a quite dif- ferent movement, the Oxford or Tractarian, was inaugurated by a sermon preached by Keble. The Evangelicals and Nonconformists had broken from the Church and laid great stress on personal re- ligion and salvation. The Oxford movement, on the other hand, minimized the importance of the individual and laid chief stress on the Church as a continuing body, a living organism in itself, the existence of which was more important than the personal views or life of any mere single member. For this reason its adherents strongly objected to the Church being subject to lay or govern- ment control, and so deeply did some of the leaders like Newman and Manning, both later Cardinals, feel that they left the Church altogether to go over to that of Rome. The secession of such lead- ing figures in the High Church Party tended to weaken it in the Anglican Church and so gave a certain impetus to the Broad Church or Modernist movement within it. This was emphasized by the influence of such men as Doctor Thomas Arnold, who were inculcating a new spirit of moral earnestness. ' Almost coincident with the beginning of the Oxford movement in England there was a renaissance of religious feeling and interest in Scotland accompanied by a demand for separation of Church and state: When compromise was found impossible in 1843 practically half the clergy left their churches and livings, but so great was the popular support and religious fervor of the day that in less than a year 500 new churches had been built for them by private subscription, and the Free Church of Scotland had been estab- l^shed. '} ( Not only these two movements, with the Evangelical, but a re- newed spirit of devotion within the Church of England itself all testified to a great religious revival throughout the United King- dom, made up of diverse currents. This must be taken heavily into account when considering other aspects of the national life, such NEW THEORY OF EMPIRE as the recrudescence of Puritanism, the improvement in the Civil Service and political life generally, the new attitude toward social questions, the preoccupation of literature with reforms of many sorts, the missionary movement, and the new sense of responsi- bility toward the backward races within the Empire. If there was much hypocrisy in the early Victorian period there was also an immense body of genuine religion, of various shadings, which had an all-pervasive influence.
 VI. REFORM IN 1867
 VI. EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER REFORMS Besides the disestablishment of the Church in Ireland, the first Gladstone Ministry had other notable reforms to its credit. The first was the/great Education Act$ introduced by W. E. Forster. In England the Church had always clung tenaciously to its control over education, but the entire system, partly of Church and partly of State, was haphazard and only about half the children in the nation received any education, however inadequate. The wide ex- tension of the franchise among the working and lower classes by the Reform Bill of 1867 had raised new problems, and it began to seem an anomaly that a man should be denied the opportunity to learn to read and write and yet be given the power to choose the rulers of the Empire. Moreover, a large part of the support of the new Liberal Party came from these same classes and from the Non- Conformist elements which had always been opposed to the stran- glehold which the Church had on both schools and universities.

 8. The conditions Cockburn enumerates includes “the fall of old sys- tems on the French revolution; the strong feelings of resentment at  our own party intolerance; the obviousness that it was only through  the press that this intolerance could be abated,” and the “dotage of  all existing journals” (LLJ I:125–6).
 8. If the ground of the Edinburgh was economics, then the Quarterly was  founded on a notion of character, and this critique of the Edinburgh  emphasizes Jeffrey’s (like Horner’s) assimilationist view of the relation  of Scotland to England. In 1807, Walter Scott had accused Francis  Jeffrey: “Little by little, whatever your wishes may be . . . [y]ou will  destroy and undermine until nothing of what makes Scotland Scotland shall remain” (Harvie 90). A decade later, Blackwood’s would  similarly  construct its identity in opposition to the Edinburgh’s assimilation- ism (Flynn “Early” 46–8).
 Reverend Jeremiah Asher, pastor of Shiloh Baptist Church in Philadel- phia, was also embraced in Britain, though he was scorned in his homeland  because of his African ancestry.113 Even the abolitionist Gerrit Smith probably  found it hard to believe—as a British emancipationist informed him—that  bias against the African was entirely unknown in London and that even in  the most elevated circles there was intermarriage.114

 One evening Arthur came to Emily, troubled. The Bishop wanted him to leave his church work and become a missionary in Ontario. There was a vital need for men who could preach effectively to travel on missions about the province. There would be no set income, only whatever collec- tions they might receive, no definite home, but a constant travelling through the hinterland of the province.
 In recent years Upper Canada had undergone a historic church revival. Leaders of the ritualistic or "high" church of the Anglo-Catholics of Trinity College were locked in combat with the "low" or Evangelical Church of the Protestant Irish. A crisis, which had the Protestant Irish up in arms, resulted when a church manual was uncovered that proposed an extreme form of ritualistic teaching. The Church Association was founded to counter the new movement and preserve the more simplistic Protestant form of worship. Wycliffe College was eventually formed to train young men to go forth and preach the doctrine of the Evangelical Church. Arthur was one of these young men.
 Visits to various churches to compare ceremonies gave Emily much room for thought. Impressed by the sermons delivered to packed congregations, she made notes for Arthur. Her stoutly Protestant mind found the ceremonies performed by the Ritualistic Church "highly theatric, and, without the clouds of incense, had been [sic] entirely trivial and vulgar." "This church," she reported, "was showered by stones on the next Sun- day, by the Evangelical pugilists of the Church Militant, and the clergy roughly handled, for it would appear that the dogs of war are loose, and the end is not yet." Emily's pacifist heart deplored such tactics. It was the constant infighting between the two religions (which she had grown up with amidst the bitter wrangling of her Irish Protestant and Catholic kin) which led her to question the validity of either denomination.
 According to Gilroy, Britain’s history of colonial expansion and its subju- gation of weaker nations has not only derailed a doctrine of multicultural- ism but has contributed to the success of an American-led ‘unipolar global  order’ (p. 3), which sustains the global structure of imperialism.
 This same Arnoldian-Leavisite tradition infl uences the novels of colo- nial servants and settlers who returned to England from the colonies dur- ing the period of extensive decolonization. Throughout his career, Greene  remained in self-exile from Britain and set his novels from the late-1950s  and early-1960s— Our Man in Havana  (1958) and  A Burnt out Case   (1960)—in Cuba and the Belgian Congo.  23   Burgess, on the other hand,  returned to England and, although he was to leave again in 1968, pro- duced a number of novels that responded to the immediate impact of  decolonization on British culture and society.

David Alderson notes that the CCCS was ‘the fi rst of its  kind, though subsequently there were to be numerous university  centres in related fi elds’ ( 2002 , p. 713). The CCCS was closed in  2002 following a restructuring of departments at Birmingham  University (see Curtis,  2002 ).
 -0 3- shaped by textual models, rather than ‘a genuine reflection of actual- ity’ (Lea 67). Part I of the novel, preceding the outbreak of the Sepoy  rebellion, establishes the parameters of a conventional romantic plot,  as George Fleury is smitten by the fair beauty of Louise Dunstaple  and has to compete for her approval with the dashing Lieutenant  Stapleton on occasions such as picnics and balls. In the eyes of the  Collector, the character on whose thoughts Farrell dwells most con- sistently, these social rituals are crucial to the colonists’ sense of  identity. At the height of the siege, he remembers the ‘many enjoy- able garden parties’ in what had once been a ‘lawn, green and well- watered’ but is now a ‘parched brown desert dotted with festering  animals’ (171). The scarlet of the uniforms of the military band per- forming on those occasions, against the green of the garden, ‘seemed  to him the indelible colours of the rightness of the world, and of his  place in it’ (171). This nostalgic image conjures a territory tamed to  recreate the equivalent space in Britain so successfully that its guard- ians do not need to perform their roles but can instead indulge in  entertainment. The rightness of the world is equated with an indel- ible superimposition of British customs on India and it is only in the  context of these premises that the Collector understands his position  in India. The siege shows up the true characteristics of the land and  forces the soldiers to take up their real function if their presence is to  continue and the colonists’ understanding of themselves is to be pre- served. This is part of a pattern in the novel that exposes the ways in  which the performance of British culture and customs conceals colo- nial domination in the country, but also hints at the colonists’ invest- ment in those social practices as a marker of their identity as Britons.  Even when the siege has stripped the British residents of all their  social niceties, the Collector insists that ‘[i]f [social conventions]  don’t matter, then nothing does’ (227). What is under threat is not  just a specific community in a foreign land but the very principles  that are acknowledged as defining Britishness.

 . . . . When this [ a disaggregation of what has been termed the 'business'  lobby] is done, the contrast commonly drawn between officialdom and  business loses much of its validity because it is apparent that an important  segment of the non-industrial business elite consisted of gentlemen who  moved in the same circles and shared the same values with those who had  their hands on the levers of power - and often managed their investments  too. Imperial and imperialist policies did not issue from a conspiracy by a  covert minority but from the open exercise of authority by a respected elite  who enjoyed the deference of those they governed. Like-mindedness was  certainly extended abroad, but it began at home.
 Those observations are certainly correct, but they do 1_10t explain why,  given the answer provided by the economic calculus, the 'respected elite'  continued to enjoy 'the deference of those they governed'. Obviously, the  established policy of recruiting the bureaucracy from the public schools and  from Oxbridge meant that the men with 'their hands on the levers of power'  did share the views of the 'gentlemen capitalists'. Moreover, it is clear that the  House of Commons was 'a quintessentially patrician legislative body dominated  by the elite classes, business, and the professions. The members had attended  ancient universities and the major public schools and they were "club men"  with a vengeance'. 35 But none of these factors was immutable. In a democracy,  rules can be changed and politicians defeated; and even in California, lobbyists  have discovered that, in the face of widespread public concern, their efforts  are not always successful.
 More generally, these firms were not particularly successful lobbyists,  either collectively or individually, and Lord Inchcape is a peculiar case. Their  primary ideological attachment seems to have been to the principle of extreme  business autonomy, and they often deliberately eschewed opportunities to draw  closer to the state for fear of permanently eroding that autonomy .11 Inchcape's  sub rosa links with officialdom were, if anything, viewed with distaste by  other expatriate businessmen. One, Henry Gladstone, son of the prime minister  and head of the firm Gillanders, Arbuthnot & Co., denounced Inchcape's  activities in the harshest terms. 12

 Gordon, who was inspired by the plight of the poor and the politics  of resistance that informed the religious revivals among the peasantry,  was baptized into the Native Baptist Church in 1861 after leaving the  Established Church and building the Tabernacle, his own Native Baptist  church in which Paul Bogle would act as a deacon, in kingston.134 Eyre’s  antipathy towards Gordon was based not only in political antagonism  but also in religious difference, insofar as Eyre’s devout Anglican beliefs,  which promoted a bourgeois morality that conflicted with those of reli- gious dissenters, was at odds with Gordon’s more liberationist vision.135

 The intensification of cultural contact in the Pacific from the 1760s modified this pattern. In the central Pacific, Europeans established sus- tained relationships with a range of Polynesian societies that had developed hierarchical forms of political organization, consolidated important divisions of labour and elaborated complex sequences of ritual performances. These communities could not easily be dismissed as mere ‘savages’ lacking religion, rather the structured nature of their polities and their strong interest in trade suggested that they possessed a significant degree of cultural sophistication. Most importantly, it seemed that they were religious and in an Enlightenment Europe where orthodox theologians, deists and anti-Church philosophes were concerned with religious diversity, the ‘natural’ religions of the Pacific were of special interest.
 But in terms of social function, the two systems were similar in that they preserved the powers of the elite groups (or racial groups in India) in society, by establishing a code of ‘no-touchism’ that protected the sanctity and power of the elites from the defiling touch of the ordinary person. In both societies, these conventions, backed by the sanction  of religious authority, provided the key socio-religious structure that governed everyday life.99
 The intensely sectarian programmes of the missionaries undoubt- edly deepened these tensions. Both Wesleyan and Anglican missionar- ies drew on pre-existing Maori resentment of the French to launch anti-Catholic campaigns which were heavily reliant on print.66 In response to the establishment of the Catholic mission the CMS pro- duced Te Anakaraiti (‘The Anti-Christ’), a pamphlet labelling the Pope the Anti-Christ. This was quickly followed by two more anti-Catholic pamphlets, in the form of dialogues between Rapu Pono (Searcher for Truth) and Aroha Pono (True Love), which detailed twelve ‘errors’ of the Catholic Church.67 As a result of this anti-Catholic propaganda, Maori routinely called Jean-Baptiste Pompallier, the Catholic Bishop, the ‘Anti-Christ’.68 Pompallier reflected that the Catholic missionaries armed with ‘only our voices and our pens’ struggled as ‘heresy [i.e. the Protestant missions] had two printing presses at its command’, which allowed both the Anglicans and the Wesleyans to circulate ‘pam- phlets, tracts, and little books, which while teaching the first truths of salvation, were filled with all sorts of objections and calumnies against  the minister and the faith of the Catholic Church.’69 When W. B. Ullathorne, the English Catholic Vicar-General of Australia, visited New Zealand in 1840 to dispel the Maori belief that only the French were Catholics, he discovered that the Protestant missionaries had not only told Maori ‘fantastic stories of the old anti-Catholic type’, but that these anti-Catholic tales had been further sensationalized ‘for  the New Zealand palate’.70 But Maori were not passive pawns in a European sectarian battle fought on New Zealand soil, as they exploited these sectarian tensions by playing on Protestant fears of ‘Popery’ to demand more frequent visits from missionaries and easier access to baptism.71

 Dealing with spirits Like India at the same time, early modern England was a society of little societies. The East India Company was founded in a world that had many companies and corporations. The economy of seventeenth-century England was dominated by highly social traders who grouped together to maintain order, protect honour and nurture the habits of interaction that kept commerce going. After Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries, town and city corporations replaced churches at the centre of urban life. Different branches of enterprise were ruled by craft guilds, which allowed independent craftsmen to nurture the ‘mysteries’ of their trade. Even after Henry’s Tudor revolution, the central state had limited control. An array of small corporate bodies was scattered throughout England’s towns and cities. It was these organizations, not the central state, which performed most of the functions of government, keeping the peace, aiding the poor, regulating the economy and supporting commerce. Essential to this system was the free conviviality each association nurtured. As historian Philip J. Stern notes, ‘by its very nature, to “traffic” was not only to truck and barter but to engage in intercourse and exchange’. English society was a commonwealth made up of ‘little platoons’, as Edmund Burke later called them. These were institutions where men (and a handful of women) met to talk and argue, often drunkenly, bound together by common rituals. As a 1695 dictionary put it, the word ‘society’ denoted ‘company, conversation, civil intercourse, fellowship’. England’s companies were not corporations in the way we understand that word today, but social bodies dedicated to nurturing the conviviality necessary to sustain a commercial society.5
 Kaye’s story was an attempt to justify the great crisis by extolling the virtues of its cause. In fact, though, there is little evidence to suggest the East India Company attempted to transform Indian society before 1857; nor is there any evidence that Indians rose up against efforts at reform. Rather, insurgents like Sir Henry Lawrence’s artillery officer fought against the increasingly authoritarian way the British clung to power. The rebellion of 1857–8 was created by Britons’ fearful over-attention to dissent rather than their blithe efforts at reform.3
 This attitude conformed to the spirit of conquering authority which followed the great insurrection throughout the British regime in India. Suspicious of democracy and hostile to unnecessary conversation with the subjects of government, Maine and Stephen were happy to impose laws founded on philosophical principles alien to Indian society where they could. But they also perceived the need to preserve Indian customs where change would be ‘unsafe’, as they put it. More so than earlier generations, Maine and Stephen thought law reflected the character of a civilization, and its imposition on another society was capable of diffusing ‘a new set of moral ideas’. Yet the security of Britain’s power in India always came before any project of moral reform.10
 The new emphasis on a government acting as the voice of a supposedly homogeneous community made those who did not feel part of that ‘single whole’ anxious. New ideas about the state emerged alongside the increasingly centralized management of the organization most likely to run an independent Indian state, the Indian National Congress. In the mid-1930s commentators began to speak of ‘the Congress High Command’, an entity one political scientist called ‘the Leviathan of [the] Indian freedom movement’ associated with ‘just a few individuals or families’. Congress was by far India’s most popular political body, with the support of a majority of voters in most provinces. But its claim to incorporate all Indian communities and act on behalf of everyone was unrealistic; its opponents saw these claims as an instance of tyranny paralleled only by the ‘despotic’ British regime.

 Some Protestant Reformers would not agree with Vasari’s criticism  of the medieval Church’s destruction of ancient artwork, there being a  strong iconoclastic streak in early Protestantism. They would no doubt  approve that practice. Like the humanists, the Protestant Reformers  identified the Middle Ages with darkness that gave way to the light of  the Reformation. For Vasari’s English contemporary John Foxe (1516– 1587), the author of the great Protestant history of the English Church,  John Wyclif (1330–1384) was “the morning-star” of the Reformation, 18 Giorgio Vasari, “Selections,” The Italian Renaissance Reader, ed. Julia Conaway  Bondanella and Mark Musa (NY: Meridian, 1987), 385–386.
 In spite of the general disinterest of medievalists in examining early  modern political thought, at the beginning of the twentieth century  there was some research being done along those lines, but from an unex- pected perspective, the study of the medieval Church, especially the fif- teenth-century movement to create a conciliar structure to govern the  Christian Church. The great legal historian, Frederic William Maitland  (1850–1906) had asserted that: The medieval church was a state. Convenience may forbid us to call it a  state very often, but we ought to do so from time to time, for we could  frame no acceptable definition of a state which would not comprehend the  church. What has it not that a state should have? It has law, lawgivers, law  courts, lawyers.
 When the medieval church is regarded as a political organism, as a state, it  becomes very interesting. As a whole the constitution of this state may be  unique, but there is hardly a feature in it for which we may not find analo- gies elsewhere. At various points it becomes a model for the constitutions  of other and secular states.39
 John Neville Figgis, a student of Maitland, summed up Maitland’s  position tersely: in “the Middle Ages the Church was not a State, it was  the State….” Consequently, the great theoretical question that should  interest scholars is to understand the “change which substituted the civil  for the ecclesiastical authority….”40 In other words, so Figgis argued, the 39 Frederic William Maitland, Roman Canon Law in the Church of England (London:  Methuen, 1898), 100.

 throne and imposed the Lombard monk Lanfranc (ca. 1005–1089) as  archbishop of Canterbury, replacing the Saxon archbishop, Stigand, as  well as most bishops and abbots, and enforcing the Gregorian reforms  that centralized the Roman Church on the previously semi-autonomous  English Church.8
 According to Hume, not satisfied with imposing feudalism on the free  Saxons, William also brought into England something else, a “doctrine  which exalted the papacy above all human power,” that is the canon law  that placed the pope at the apex of a universal legal system and consti- tuted him the chief and unchallenged head of the Church. He did this  because the papacy had blessed his invasion of England. The goal was to  “break the spiritual as well as civil independency of the Saxons, who had  hitherto conducted their ecclesiastical government, with an acknowledg- ment indeed of primacy in the see of Rome, but without much idea of its  title to dominion or authority.”31 The consequence of William’s actions  was to keep “united the civil and ecclesiastical powers” in a wicked con- spiracy to keep the English in permanent submission.32

 developed, the situation changed. According to Berthoff and Murrin, by  1730 “the older colonies had become populous enough to make the old  feudal claims incredibly lucrative.”69 “As in France, the feudal revival in  the English colonies employed old legal and social forms for quite single- mindedly modern purposes.”70 What was happening in France, the rip- ping of “feudal relationships out of their original context” in order to  seize “what surviving obligations could be enforced for the income they  might produce” was also taking place in the British colonies in North  America.”71 Strictly speaking, if Berthoff and Murrin are correct, what  was on the upswing in North America, was the economic side of the feu- dal order that is manorialism.
 … the apprehension of Episcopacy contributed fifty years ago, as much as  any other cause, to arouse the attention, not only of the inquiring mind,  but of the common people, and urge them to close thinking on the consti- tutional authority of parliament over the colonies.1
 law and Martin Luther even publicly burned copies of canon law in a  bonfire designed to mark the end of the old church.3 In practice, canon  law was employed as a synonym for ecclesiastical oppression that cor- rupted both spiritual and political communities.
 In terms of the Norman Yoke, canon law recalled the role of the  papacy in supporting William the Conqueror’s invasion of England,  support symbolized by Pope Alexander II’s (1061–1073) blessing of  a banner borne before William at the battle of Hastings.4 The price of  this support was the Conqueror’s agreement to reform the Church in  England according to the principles of the Gregorian Reform move- ment.5 The visible sign of this alliance was the appointment of the Italian  scholar and monk Lanfranc (c. 1005–1089) as archbishop of Canterbury,  replacing the Saxon Stigand who had been excommunicated.6
 From the perspective of Adams, as feudalism destroyed the political  structure of Anglo-Saxon society, reducing the people to serfdom, so the  church reform movement of the eleventh and twelfth centuries destroyed  the Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical structure. The reformed Church’s heavy  emphasis on papal universal administrative jurisdiction, symbolized by 6 On Lanfranc: see Margaret Gibson, Lanfranc of Bec (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978);  H.E.J. Cowdrey, Lanfranc: Scholar, Monk, and Archbishop (Oxford: Oxford University  Press, 2003).
 5 The papacy had a long history of involvement with English monarchs stretching back  to the mission sent by Pope Gregory I in 596. A modern scholar has suggested that even  the Church reformers such as Gregory VII allowed William and his immediate successors  a great deal of room to intervene in ecclesiastical matters, even to the extent that “William  the Conqueror, his sons, and perhaps grandson, Henry II, dominated what could be called  a national church.” See Uta-Renate Blumenthal, The Investiture Controversy: Church and  Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania  Press, 1988), 153; see also Kathleen G. Cushing, Reform and the Papacy in the Eleventh  Century: Spirituality and Social Change (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2005), 77.
 uniformity of ritual and the development of a canon law for the entire  Church, spelled the end of a kind of primitive Church institutionally dis- tinct from Rome for the most part.7
 The deposition of Stigand (d. 1072) as archbishop of Canterbury  and appointment of Lanfranc (1005–1089), an Italian scholar who had  become a monk in Normandy and who was associated with the reform  movement, signaled the imposition of the Gregorian Reform move- ment in England.9 Subsequently almost all of the bishops of the Saxon  Church were deposed and replaced by Norman clerics just as virtually all  major Saxon landholders were replaced by William’s followers. Lanfranc  enforced the strict ecclesiastical discipline associated with the Church  reform, celibacy of the clergy for example, in place of what the papacy  saw as the relaxed standards of the church in Saxon England.10

 Years later (1815) Adams went on to admit that such concern about  the importance of fears about the creation of an Anglican diocese in  North America on the eve of the Revolution would be hard to accept  in a country which now possessed bishops of various sorts, Methodist,  Anglican and even “bishops, archbishops, and Jesuits of the church of  Rome.”12 It was a measure of the changes that had taken place between  1765 and 1815 that Adams was forced to explain why he believed that  the colonists had been driven to revolution by fears of bishops.
 The writer to whom he was referring was Jonathan Mayhew, who had  criticized the policy of the Society for Propagating the Gospel [SPG] for  sending its missionaries into already Christian New England instead of  into the lands of the infidel Indians.17 To Mayhew and his fellow New  Englanders such as Adams the SPG was yet another instrument for  imposing British imperial control on the colonists rather than a vehicle  for missionary work among the Indians. As colonial self-government 16 Adams, Papers, 1: 127–128. 17 Alan Heimert has suggested that the fact “the legend [of Mayhew’s importance] per- sists despite this record is probably testimony to the effectiveness of John Adams’ remi- niscences,” where he labeled Mayhew the “fifth most important spokesman” for what  Adams termed “American principles.” Alan Heimart, Religion and the American Mind:  From the Great Awakening to the Revolution (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1966),  290–291.

 was being undercut by Parliament’s claim to be able to tax the colonists  without their consent, so too, colonial self-government in ecclesiastical  affairs, the right of the congregation to select its own minister, would  be ended if the discipline of the Anglican Church were to be imposed in  New England through the establishment of diocesan administration.
 The debate about having a bishop had a long history because it dealt  with the very nature of the Christian Church. The Puritans saw the  retention of bishops and a hierarchical church structure by the Church  of England as the most obvious sign of that Church’s incomplete accept- ance of the Reformation. Removing to America, the Puritans could  remain members of the Church of England but could create a church  structure that they believed to be more in keeping with the structure of  the early church than was the episcopal model. The congregational and  presbyterian structures as they developed in British North America were  attempts to re-create the structure of the early church. The settlement  of America was, therefore, part of the continuous process of freeing men  from the burdens of medieval ecclesiastical tyranny that had begun in the  sixteenth century, a process that paralleled the task of freeing men from  their feudal bonds. This process reached its climax in England: under the execrable race of the Steuarts, the struggle between the people  and the confederacy aforesaid of temporal and spiritual tyranny, became  formidable, violent and bloody.18
 The purpose of colonizing North America “seems to have been to  establish a government of the church more consistent with the scrip- tures, and a government of the state more agreeable to the dignity of  human nature ….” In order to achieve those goals the encrustations of  feudal and ecclesiastical laws had to be identified and removed. Just as  the creation of a proper political structure required the dismantling of  feudal law and the governmental institutions that had developed during  the Middle Ages, so the establishment of “a church more consistent with  the Scriptures” would require dismantling the medieval church’s law  and institutional structure that the Church of England had retained.19  Furthermore, just as Adams’s arguments about the nature and evils of 18 Adams, Papers, 1: 113. 19 Ibid., 1: 115–116.
 In the Dissertation on the Canon and the Feudal Law, Adams assumed  that his readers were acquainted with the history of the Church as the  Protestant reformers had presented it. That history generally contrasted  the Christian community of the first three centuries with the medieval  Church. Broadly speaking, that history showed the Church as pass- ing through a series of stages in the 1500 years before the Protestant  Reformation. The first stage was that of the early Church, a voluntary  community that had no connection with the state. The second stage  began with the legalization of Christianity by the Emperor Constantine  in 311. This began a period of gradual decline from the simplicity of the  primitive Church as the leaders of the Church, now favored by the impe- rial government, lost their zeal and virtue.
 In the tenth and eleventh centuries, as feudalism was emerging from  the ruins of the Roman world to create a wicked political order, so  too the papacy was emerging out of the decaying remains of the early  Church to impose canon law on the Christian people. From then until  the Reformation of the sixteenth century, the papacy and its corrupt sys- tem dominated the Christian Church. There were, however, always those  who opposed the papal system and were forerunners of the sixteenth- century Reformers. The Reformation was, according to this view of  Christian history, a return to the primitive form of Christianity, a return  to the roots of the Church as it existed before the bishops of Rome came  to seize control of it and corrupt it.20
 of the corrupted Middle Ages and the papally-led Catholic Church pro- vided the ecclesiastical system, canon law, for that era.
 In the English-speaking world, the most important source of the  Reformers version of Church history was John Foxe [1516–1587],  whose Acts and Monuments or Book of Martyrs provided Englishmen with  the history of the early and the medieval church in general and the his- tory of the English church in particular.22 Curiously, Foxe’s work had  developed along the lines that Hume’s History was to develop, that is,  he began with the more recent period and then, in later editions, added  medieval material. In the edition of 1559, Foxe began withJohn Wyclif  (1320–1384), the English theologian and heretic whom he termed the  “morning star” of the Reformation.23 In the edition of 1570, Foxe had  added material dealing with the early history of the Church, the bringing  of Christianity to England in the days of the Apostles and the develop- ment of Christianity in England on through the Middle Ages. The result  was another important addition to the knowledge of the Middle Ages  available to Englishmen.
 Haller’s book on Foxe and his earlier The Rise of Puritanism (New York: Columbia  University Press, 1938) are fundamental to understanding the historical outlook of the  Puritans, both at home and abroad in the colonies.
 When Adams came to discuss the evils of the medieval Church, the  canon law system, he did not have to provide his readers with the details  of the historical development involved. He could simply point to the  corruption of the Catholic Church as the end product of the develop- ment. The settlers of North America, the ancestors of his readers, had  rejected the medieval church and all its corruptions.
 In effect, Adams was condemning the entire Catholic development  of the theology of the sacraments, especially Holy Orders, that had  occurred during the Middle Ages and which was seen by Protestants  as central to the clergy’s domination of Christian society. The clergy 58, 128; L.B. Wright, The Cultural Life of the American Colonies: 1607–1763 (New York:  Harper, 1957), 133.
 The institutional consequence of this sacramental theology that  Adams condemned was “the whole system of Diocesan episcopacy,” the  regular administrative structure of the medieval church by which every  Christian lived within a diocese and a parish, under the supervision of a  bishop and a parish priest.29 In this way, the superstructure of priests and  bishops sat upon one shoulder of the masses and the feudal hierarchy on  the other. In a weakened form, many of these corruptions existed within  the Church of England according to its critics.
 When the first colonists came to Massachusetts Bay, they rejected this  sacramental theology and its institutional consequence, the diocesan  structure. Instead of basing the power of the clergy on “the ridiculous  fancies of sanctified effluvia from episcopal fingers, they established sac- erdotal ordination, on the foundation of the bible and common sense.”  The result was the formation of a body of clergy characterized by “indus- try, virtue, piety and learning” instead of forming “a sordid, stupid,  wretched herd” as did the Roman clergy. The reformed clergy were, as  a result, “infinitely more independent on the civil powers, in all respects  than they could be where they were formed into a scale of subordination,  from a pope down to priests and fryars and confessors ….”30 The result  was an educated and free clergy more in keeping with the biblical model  of the clergy than with the medieval papal model. His theme was the for- mation of a republican church for a republican people.
 Adams’s emphasis on the independence of the clergy in New England  reflected what he saw as the most dangerous aspect of the medieval  church, its relationship with secular power, the conspiracy of canon and  feudal law to oppress the great bulk of the members of society for their  own selfish interests. The colonists: had an utter contempt of all that dark ribaldry of hereditary, indefeasible  right-the Lord’s anointed-and the divine, miraculous original of govern- ment, with which the priesthood had enveloped the feudal monarch in  clouds and mysteries, and from whence they had deduced the most mis- chievous of all doctrines, that of passive obedience and non resistance.
 The key to retaining liberty in both church and state was knowledge.  Not only did the colonists create a political and ecclesiastical system  that was designed to prevent the re-creation of feudal and canonical sys- tems in North America, they created educational institutions that would  insure the continuation of that state of affairs.
 In arguing thus, Adams neatly reversed the wicked alliance of feudal and  canon law that characterized the Middle Ages and the Stuart era. In New  England, the clergy side with liberty and with the people against gov- ernmental oppression and the enslavement of the people. As long as the  clergy are learned and their congregations composed of educated people,  feudal and ecclesiastical oppression cannot exist in the colonies in spite of  English pressure. The clergy are to call the people to liberty rather than  convincing them that slavery is their appointed lot in life. They are in  effect to play a role directly opposed to that of the medieval clergy.
 How real was Adams’s fear that the British government was planning  to erect an Anglican diocese in North America with all of its attendant  evils? On the one hand, there was strong interest among some segments  of the Church of England to establish formal church control over the  American churches by establishing a diocese.35 This generated a great  deal of apprehension on the part of at least some of the Americans, that  if a diocese was created the Independent churches of New England  would lose their independence and become subject to episcopal control.  This fear was accentuated by the submission of a number of well-known  clerics to the Church of England as well as accepting Anglican ordination  in the 1720s. These individuals subsequently became active in the move- ment to bring a bishop to the colonies, forming a kind of fifth column  undermining the colonial intention to remain free of episcopal control.  If the Anglican Church became the established church in America, more  clerics might submit and the Independent churches would be forced to  accept Anglican discipline or to fade away. In New England, above all,  the Independents would lose their own established status with its finan- cial and political advantages.
 The increasing activity of the SPG in New England during the 1760s  led to even more fear of episcopacy. Years later, Adams wrote that when  the Reverend East Apthorp: 34 Ibid., 1: 126. 35 Cross, 144–147; Woolverton, 220–225.
 The reference to Lambeth of course accentuated the threat because  Lambeth Palace was the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the head  of the Church of England under the king. Adams was suggesting here  not simply that the appointment of a single bishop was feared but the  creation of an extensive hierarchy of bishops under an archbishop. Such  a situation would not only be oppressive ecclesiastically but economically  as well. A clerical hierarchy would require income suitable to its members  rank and station just as the rank and status of the crown’s secular officials  required incomes from taxes on the colonists.
 If Adams and his contemporaries pointed to the actions of the  Anglicans alone on the issue of an American episcopate, then perhaps  one might be inclined to reject their fears as excessive. The end of the  wars with France that brought all of French Canada under British con- trol in 1763, however, posed another threat on the religious front. The  inhabitants of French Canada were of course Catholics and the treaty  that ended the war contained provisions that protected the Catholic  Church from interference. This did not appeal to the New Englanders  who had long feared invasion from Canada by Frenchmen and Indians  aroused to slaughter New England Protestants by their priests. When  he came to reflect on the importance of the debate about an American  episcopate fifty years later, John Adams pointed to the Quebec Act of  1774 which granted official standing to the Catholic Church in Canada,  making it in effect an established Church.37 From this later perspective  Adams saw his fear of episcopacy in British North America as confirmed.  If the British government was going to accept the Catholic Church with  its bishops as the established religion of a body of its subjects in Canada,  what could possibly hold the government back from creating a diocese  of the Church of England for its American colonists who were, presuma- bly, already members of the Church of England? From the perspective of 36 Adams, Letter to J. Morse, Works, 10: 187; see also Bridenbaugh, 211–212. 37 Adams, Letter to J. Morse, Works, 10: 188. For the terms of the Act: see “The Quebec Act,” Commager, Documents, 74–76.
 Americans like Adams, the differences between Roman Catholicism and  the Church of England were not really very great. There was also always  the fear that the Church of England would reunite with Rome, a fear  that had fanned the conflict with the Stuarts, even to the point of accus- ing Archbishop Laud, who hated the Catholic Church, of being a secret  Catholic.38 The eventual return of the Stuart family to the Catholic  Church provided more evidence of the existence of a Catholic conspiracy  at the highest levels of English government.39
 It is important to realize at this point that Adams’s experience with  Catholics, above all priests and bishops, was derived from his reading  of history. He never encountered a bishop in the flesh until his mis- sion to France during the Revolution when he encountered priests and  bishops in some numbers at the French court. Furthermore, after the  Revolution, he was proud of his role in assisting the formation of the  Episcopal Church in the United States.40 His opposition, so it would  seem, was not so much to bishops in the flesh as bishops in history.
 39 James II had become a Catholic secretly before ascending the throne and his second  wife was a Catholic French princess. The last Stuart was a cardinal of the Roman Church,  Henry Benedict Stuart (1725–1807). On the later Stuarts and Catholicism: see Geoffrey  Scott, “The court as a centre of Catholicism,” in Edward Corp, A Court in Exile: The  Stuarts in France, 1689–1718 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004): 234–256.
 Writing in Elizabethan England, Foxe stressed the subordination of  the church to the state and of all subjects, even priests and bishops,  to royal justice. At the same time, he was also critical of the way in  which Becket’s death had occurred. The four knights who had actually 48 Ibid., 2: 196–197. 49 Ibid.
 John Foxe and the other polemical historians of the sixteenth century,  along with the antiquarians who discovered, edited, and published the  relevant documents, provided later historians with the materials from  which they could write the history of the Middle Ages without, they  claimed, entering into the confessional wars involving scholars from the  different Christian denominations. At the same time, the secular-minded  historians of the Enlightenment tended to follow in the footsteps of the  Protestant historians of the Reformation when it came to understand- ing and judging the medieval church. They too despised bishops, con- demned the entire papally directed ecclesiastical structure, and generally  sided with secular rulers when dealing with the medieval Church-State  conflict. Historians in the tradition of the philosophes were not, however,  interested in supporting the arguments of Protestant historians about  how the sixteenth century saw a return to pure, primitive Christianity.  What the philosophes did assert, however, was the need to return to the  virtuous polity that existed before the barbarian invasions and the rise  of the Christian Church. Like the Protestant historians, the philosophes  were interested in returning to a purer antiquity, in this case the Roman  Republic, not the church communities described in the Acts of the  Apostles.
 Even if Adams and his contemporaries did not read Foxe, they did  read about the medieval English church in a variety of histories that  were not ostensibly devoted either to medieval or to ecclesiastical his- tory. When Paul de Rapin-Thoyras came to examine the conflict between  Henry II and Becket, he painted the contrast between the goals of  the bishops and those of the king in even starker terms than Foxe. He  pointed to the way in which: the power of the Clergy was increase’d to the Prejudice of the Royal  Authority. Henry, who had seen very bad effects of it in the Reign of  Stephen, resolv’d upon his Accession to the Crown to do his Endeavour to  bring this exorbitant Power within due Bounds.
 For eighteenth-century Americans like John Adams and his contem- poraries, bishops like Thomas Becket were the bishops they knew and  feared. Even though the twelfth-century Archbishop of Canterbury  was chronologically much further removed from eighteenth-century  Boston than were the contemporary bishops and archbishops of the  Anglican Church, the fact that Becket played such a large role in the  histories that the colonial Americans read meant that when a polemi- cist like Adams wanted to arouse colonial Americans to oppose English  policies that could lead to an American episcopate, he would use those  images that were most inclined to move his audience in the direction he  wished them to go. Becket represented the worst possible politico-reli- gious situation. He was a leading member of the church that had cor- rupted the true Christian faith and he wanted to replace government by  kings with government by priests. He was far worse than the worst of the  Anglican bishops, even William Laud, the seventeenth-century scourge  of the Puritans. Laud, after all, fell, and with the subsequent fall of King  Charles I went the last hope of a Church-State relationship in England  like that of the medieval Church. For the Puritans, what was wrong with 76 On Langton’s important role in the creation of Magna Carta: see F.M. Powicke,  Stephen Langton (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1928), 112–114. Powicke’s position was  strongly criticized by H.G. Richardson and G.O. Sayles, The Governance of Mediaeval  England from the Conquest to Magna Carta (Edinburgh: University Press, 1963), vi, 363.  See also, John Hudson, “Magna and the ius commune, and English Common Law,” in  Magna Carta and the England of King John, ed. Janet S. Loengard (Woodbridge: Boydell  Press, 2010), 99–119.
 Laud was that he was, according to them, inclined toward Rome.78 At  best, or, perhaps more accurately, at worst, Laud was only a pale reflec- tion of the great evil bishops of the Middle Ages of whom Becket was  the exemplar.
 If the Americans had accepted this “power or pretended power,” then  they would have opened the floodgates of despotic parliamentary rule: But if parliament can erect dioceses and appoint bishops, they may intro- duce the whole hierarchy, establish tithes, forbid marriages and funerals,  establish religions, forbid dissenters, make schism heresy, [and] impose  penalties extending to life and limb as well as to liberty and property.83
 authority ….” Given these examples, it is not surprising that “in the same  predicament are the American colonies, and all the other dispersions of  the empire.”43
 The charter also pointed to “the reducing and Conversion of such sav- ages as remaine [there] … to Civil Societies and Christian Religion ….46
 independence of England but in its use against papal claims to univer- sal ecclesiastical jurisdiction. In the year following the Act of Appeals,  he issued an act separating the English Church from papal jurisdiction  and declaring the king “the supreme head of the Church of England,” in  effect uniting the temporal and the spiritual powers in the yoke.26
 Leonard assumed that the notion of the fullest expression of impe- rial power was present in the king in Parliament formula that was cre- ated only in the wake of the revolution of 1688–1689. Opposition to  the notion of the king in Parliament, and the consequent jurisdiction of  Parliament over the American colonies, “tends manifestly to independ- ence,” a status to which the colonies would logically arrive “did not  Great Britain check them” before that occurred.93
 they claimed to be devout Calvinists. Adams admitted that there was  no evidence that the members of the junto “ever directly solicited for  Bishops” but such an establishment would be a logical consequence of  “establishing the unlimited authority of parliament!”22 Thus the yoke  was not only tyrannical, it was generated corruption allowing officials  who served it to advance their own interests at the expense of their fel- low colonists.
 In arguing that there had been no long-term planning for the devel- opment of an overseas empire composed of colonial settlements estab- lished by English settlers, Adams was correct. The American colonies  had not been created as a result of deliberate imperial policy but to serve  the interests of various groups of English people. The current efforts to  impose direct parliamentary control over the colonies resulted from the  English government’s realization that there was “a defect in her govern- ment” that required attention. Such a correction should “be supply’d by  some just and reasonable means” which meant for Adams “the consent  of the Colonies ….” What Adams was calling for was a meeting where  colonists and royal officials could work out a kind of imperial constitu- tion that would recognize that the colonies had proved successful.63
 Adams’s empire was thus not a neatly arranged hierarchical structure  with the king of England and his Parliament at the peak directing and  coordinating all the elements of the empire towards a common goal as  Leonard would have it. Instead it was a collection of separate states each  of which possessed a unique relationship to the king of England alone,  based on its own history. Each of these constituent elements of the  king’s domain would have its own form of government, laws, and cus- toms, and, perhaps most important of all, its own economic and political  interests which could be in conflict with those other constituent states or  with the goals of the empire itself.
 Leonard’s claim to having a realistic view of the empire and of the col- onists’ place within it included recognizing that the empire was an insti- tution in a continual process of development. That being the case the  early charters and related documents associated with the establishment  of the colonies, the documents on which Adams based his arguments,  did not provide the governing principles of the empire’s colonial policy  in the eighteenth century. Massachusetts in 1775 was very different from  the small community founded in 1630 and the British government had  changed even more. In his opinion, the eighteenth-century inhabitants  of British North America could not expect that they would be treated as  if they were they still lived in the fragile seventeenth-century settlements  whose future was doubtful.
 The older arrangement of the territories labeled the British Empire  was quite satisfactory to Adams because it kept royal power widely dis- tributed and limited by the specific terms according to which the individ- ual lands were acquired. It was the drive to create a sovereign, unlimited  power, identified with the king in Parliament, that Adams opposed and  not the empire as such. In theory at least, there could have been a feder- ated form of empire. Under those circumstances, the power of the sov- ereign would be constrained in a fashion rather like the system of checks  and balances that Adams argued should be the basis of the American  constitutional structure.
 The historical record was important to Adams because it provided  tangible evidence of the structure and principles of English development.  It was on the solid ground of charters and other official documents and  the historically based common law, not the theories of eighteenth-cen- tury philosophers, that the English constitution developed. It was the  historical experience of the English people that created the governmental  structure so that those engaged in the debate about the nature of the  empire in the eighteenth century should first study that history.

 Anti-colonial lobbying in international bodies, too, was of little  consequence for the end of colonial rule and is traditionally overvalued.65
 Counterfactuals are, of course, impossible to prove. One cannot assert, for instance, with any degree of certitude, events that did not in fact occur, nor name that centralizing figure who might have been India’s Bismarck, Mazzini, Atatürk or Garibaldi in the absence of the British. But historical events find their own dramatis personae, and it is unreasonable to suggest that what happened everywhere else would not have happened in India. From such an initially hybrid system could have emerged a modern constitutional monarchy and political institutions built upon the Mughal administrative system, as modified by the Marathas. But these are hypotheticals. The British came, and no such non-colonial India emerged.
 Part of the problem was that the Indian social structures were unfamiliar to the British, whose own villages survived in a largely feudalistic relationship to their landlords. Empire was in many ways the vehicle for the extension of British social structures to the colonies they conquered. The socio-political constructs that the British made in their Empire were primarily reflections of the traditional, individualistic, unequal and still class-ridden society that existed in England. The architects of Empire, responding to what they knew, sought to recreate the rural arcadia of Tory England, where local government since the sixteenth century had been controlled by those with high social prestige and ruled by an established squirearchy. Instead of the autonomous village governments the British dismantled in India, English villages were in the hands of the traditional lords, the grandees being supplemented by gentry attached to them. The English tried to find similar structures in the traditional societies of their colonies, and when they could not, they invented an approximation of them. Thus was born the ‘indirect rule’ system of government that characterized much of the Empire, with power devolved to an entire hierarchy of greater and lesser imitation ‘gentlemen’, many given British-invented titles like ‘Rai Bahadur’ or even knighted (and, in a couple of cases, ennobled) for their pains. This was both less expensive for the Empire and, as with the English system at home, it was run by complicit amateurs, so there was no need to create a professional class of Indians who would wield, and then seek to exercise, political authority.
 Yes, it brought in a supposedly free press, but ensured it operated under severe constraints, and planted the seeds of representative parliamentary institutions while withholding the substance of power from Indians.
 So relief at the fall of King James and the triumph of the Dutch Protestant William of Orange in 1688 was overwhelming. As soon as news of the Glorious Revolution arrived in New England, Boston led the way with a band of rebels seizing the royal governor and dissolving the hated Dominion. Yet at the same time as the colony revived its old forms of self-government, Boston developed a novel sense of fealty towards the Crown after all those decades of hostility towards the Stuarts. With King William III on the throne, Boston’s Puritans finally felt there was a godly monarch culturally attuned to New England’s religious and political ethos. That sense of divergence from England, which had marked out the foundation of Massachusetts in the 1630s, began to ebb as the spiritual and political interests of Crown and colony aligned. Increasingly, the evangelical leaders of late seventeenth-century Boston could see themselves as part of a shared, global endeavour to resist popery, protect true religion and promote English liberty alongside their Protestant monarch. In reality, William III would continue with much of the Stuarts’ policy of centralizing control over the American colonies: the rewritten Massachusetts charter of 1691 shifted the franchise qualification from church membership to property holding and kept the governorship a Crown appointment. Inevitably, this created the risk of a clash between the royal prerogative of the governor (usually, a former British army officer) and the autonomy of the Massachusetts House of Representatives (elected by male colonists since 1629), but at the turn of the eighteenth century such tensions were non-existent. The remarkable, natural sympathy which sprang up between elites in Massachusetts and the mother country – shared beliefs in the liberties of Magna Carta, the terrifying spectre of French and Spanish Catholicism, the wretchedness of the Stuarts and the virtues of the 1688 constitutional settlement – overshadowed any theoretical constitutional incompatibility. For now, Boston was delighted to be a part of Britain’s emergent, Atlantic empire.22
 Barbados was called by settlers and colonial officials alike ‘little England’. The most easterly of the Caribbean islands, it was among the first to be colonized and long held its own as an imperial pace-setter. It was ‘the mother colony, the centre to which newly-formed colonies looked for labour, experienced planters, capital, and leadership in matters of imperial politics and trade’.6 The Englishness of the island – its cathedrals, parliament, parishes, cricket pitches, garrisons and gardens – would become a source of intense pride. ‘On no one of our foreign possessions is the print of England’s foot more strongly impressed than on Barbados,’ wrote the nineteenth-century historian J. A. Froude. ‘It has been ours for two centuries and three-quarters, and was organized from the first on English traditional lines, with its constitution, its parishes and parish churches and churchwardens, and schools and parsons, all on the old model; which the unprogressive inhabitants have been wise enough to leave undisturbed.’7
 At work as well as in play, Somerset oversaw the steady Anglicization of Cape culture. In 1812, the Latin School in Cape Town was instructed by Government House ‘to promote and establish the cultivation of the English language to the greatest extent among your pupils of the highest rank, as the foundation upon which they will in their future life best make their way’. Somerset took the policy further by replacing Dutch teachers ‘by Englishmen of a superior class, as affording both the best means of making the English language more general in the Colony and improving the manners and morals of the people’. In official documentation, English took over from Dutch, and British jurisprudence subsumed Dutch law as the colony’s legal system. In matters spiritual, Scottish Calvinist ministers started to assume the ministries at Dutch Reformed churches, and Anglican services became the norm. Increasingly frozen out of law, politics and business, Cape Town’s original Dutch residents became progressively disillusioned and resentful of British rule – so much so that many allied themselves with the Boer farmers to join the Great Trek northward in the 1830s out of the Cape Colony and into the Transvaal.73
 Such extravagant, ornamental regard for the display and rituals of power was elemental to Wellesley’s Empire. He believed in awing his Indian subjects with ceremony and, like Cornwallis, instilling some sense of civic discipline into Calcutta’s dissolute ruling class. ‘I am resolved to encounter the task of effecting a thorough reform in private manners,’ Wellesley had written to the British foreign secretary, Lord Grenville, upon his arrival in 1798. ‘The effect … has been to compel me to entrench myself within forms and ceremonies, to introduce much state into the whole appearance of my establishments and household to expel all approaches to familiarity, and to exercise my authority with a degree of vigour and strictness nearly amounting to severity.’75 The lax, dissolute Calcutta of William Hickey came under sustained assault from Wellesley’s reformation of manners: extra-marital affairs, interracial liaisons, drinking and gambling and a critical, free press were all now subject to close supervision. In their place, the governor-general promoted a new code of colonial honour based upon the army, the Company and the Anglican church. Morality and pageantry, deference and duty were to provide the templates of colonial Calcutta, and they were all carefully codified in the design and iconography of his greatest architectural legacy to the city: Government House.

 how the end of Empire reverberated beyond the state has led me to explore its  impact on the domestic Church of England.14
 The British polity, however, was pluralistic in character and these institutions  had acquired or been given a sense of agency, reflecting the distinctive nature  of British political culture. They could not operate entirely independently of the  state, but, even if subject in principle to ministerial control, still acted with con- siderable autonomy. As Patrick Joyce argues, the British state, as it developed in  the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, was a ‘liberal’ one, not only because it was  based on principles of political liberty, but also because it was one which permit- ted persons, places or institutions, which Joyce describes as ‘designated governed  entities’, to operate ‘ostensibly on their own, without outside interference’.15 What  is more these might be perceived as distinct from the British state, and their sepa- rate identities would be important in their ability to negotiate a changing overseas  landscape brought about by decolonization. Within the British system institu- tions beyond the state also contributed to the business of governance, as Oxford  and Cambridge did by training Britain’s imperial administrators. Further, within  British political culture there was a consensus even among public servants (in 14  Sarah Stockwell, ‘ “Splendidly Leading the Way?” Archbishop Fisher and Decolonisation in  British Colonial Africa’ in Robert Holland and Sarah Stockwell eds., Ambiguities of Empire:  Essays in Honour of Andrew Porter (Routledge, London, 2009), pp. 199–218; Sarah Stockwell,  ‘ “Improper and Even Unconstitutional”: The Involvement of the Church of England in the  Politics of End of Empire in Cyprus’ in S.

 On a spectrum from ‘state’ to ‘nonstate’ the universities of Oxford and  Cambridge, while from their medieval foundation intended to serve the twin  needs of church and state, were in some respects more obviously at the periph- ery, although from the mid- nineteenth century they became subject to greater  state regulation. Legislation in 1854 and 1856 intervened to make them less  religiously exclusive, which together with the Northcote- Trevelyan civil ser- vice reforms, aimed at the creation of a public service class. Further legislation  in 1877 stipulated that research and teaching should be among the aims of the  universities, while governments also had patronage over some key university  appointments. The establishment of the University Grants Committee (UGC)  in 1919 and introduction of state funding, in 1923 to Oxbridge, but earlier else- where, represented a further development in the relationship of universities to  the state with the new Committee instituting quinquennial university reviews.  The universities nonetheless retained considerable independence from the  state, with government funding accounting for only a proportion of university  income and the UGC not inclined towards intervention.20
 The Royal Mint has attracted little attention from historians of imperialism.  Yet it has been judged to have been by 1914 ‘one of the great institutions of the  British Empire’.96 Although, as we shall see, a decline in its direct involvement  in some parts of the Empire, specifically the old Commonwealth, would occur  in the middle decades of the twentieth century, these years would neverthe- less see the colonial Empire, including Britain’s African colonies, assume an  enhanced commercial importance to the Mint.
 The Ghali assassination underlined for the British something that   nationalists in Egypt and other colonies already knew: that the most  fertile  and free arena in which to organize a cadre of strong and committed  nationalist activists was actually in the imperial metropoles, where an entire   generation of ambitious colonials were being sent to study. Thus, Kitchener,  in responding to Sir Edward Grey’s request in 1912, claimed that there were  260 Egyptians studying in England: 60 on government scholarships, and  200 at the expense of their families.

 as-Shubban al-Muslimeen The Young Men’s Muslim Association ( Jami’yat al-shubban al-Muslimeen)  was founded in 1927 by a group of men inspired by the Young Men’s  Christian Association, which was opening branches in Egypt at that time.  The founders, Muhibaddin al-Khatib, Ahmad Taymur, Muhammad Khidr  Husain, and ‘Ali Galal Husni, saw the purpose of the Association to be  “strengthening the religious and moral character of Muslim Youth in the  face of the rising tide of amorality, missionary work, and Westernization.”51  Although the Charter of the Association declared its commitment to the  moral and cultural betterment of Muslims and eschewed any “political posi- tion,” it also included articles dedicated to restoring the caliphate as well as  furthering rapprochement among the Muslim sects, both arguably political  goals—and possibly even mutually contradictory. For the first decade of its  existence, the Association in Egypt mostly concentrated on hosting lectures  and opening new branches; its offspring in the rest of the Arab world would  become far more openly politically active, particularly in Palestine.52
 As Jankowski and others have noted, however, Misr al-Fataa (Young  Egypt) was the embodiment of the youth movement of the era. It was  unique among these groups as it was started and run by the youth them- selves, and not as an affiliate to another group. It was also very successful;  founded in 1933 as a patriotic society to promote social reforms, it was able  to become a political party by the end of 1936. The founders of the group,  Ahmed Hussein and Fathi Radwan, were both products and promoters of  the anti-imperial nationalism of the era.40 Their slogan for Misr al-Fataa  was “Egypt above all’ (Misr fawq al-jami’) and they sought not only to end  British dominance in Egypt but also to “reawaken” a specific Egyptian  nationalism based on economic and cultural independence from “foreign  influences.” In this, they were reflecting a larger societal reorientation east- ward, as described by many historians of the period.
 Muhammad ‘Abduh (1849–1905) Of fellah origins and a graduate of the premier Islamic university of   al-Azhar, ‘Abduh would eventually become Mufti of Egypt. Exiled with  the ‘Urabists, he was pardoned and returned to Egypt in 1889 after seven  years in Paris and Beirut. During this time, however, he came to the con- clusion that Islamic societies were in need of reform and that “progress”  did not necessarily mean Europeanization or Christianization. Thus, a  de facto supporter of the Occupation, he rose through the government- religious ranks to become Mufti in 1899. His disciples took a number of  paths in defining the role of religion in public and government life, some- times in direct opposition to one another, an indication of the vagueness  of some of ‘Abduh’s theories, according to his critics. Muhammad ‘Abduh  has inspired a number of academic studies, including Muhammad Rashid  Rida, Tarikh al-Ustadh al-imam al-Shaykh Muhammad ‘Abduh wa ma jara  bi-misr fi ‘asrih, (Cairo: Matba’at al-Manar, 1930) and ‘Atef al’Iraqi (ed.)  al-Shaykh Muhammad ‘Abduh (1849–1905): buhuth  wa-dirasat ‘an hayatihi  wa afkarihi (Cairo: Majlis al-‘ala li-thiqafa, 1995).

Popular pressure had led to the creation of a Coptic Lay Council  (majlis al-milli) over the objections of the clergy in 1874 and the council had  become a real threat to the monopoly of the ecclesiastics on church policy and  money by 1883. One of the major issues was oversight of the large religious  endowment of the Patriarchy (a waqf, or un-taxable trust, under government  law), although there were also struggles over communication with govern- ment authorities.

 Anti-colonial lobbying in international bodies, too, was of little  consequence for the end of colonial rule and is traditionally overvalued.65
 The direction of what Barker charted as these ‘trails of light’ can be seen in images such as Samuel Brees’ Church of England, Wellington [Figure 8.1], in which women cluster about colonial churches. In fact, women were almost always pictured in the vicin- ity of churches when these featured in colonial prospects. The reason lies, again, in the force of metropolitan understandings of female ‘character’. Women were more religious than men, Edward Gibbon Wakefield argued in 1849, and this especially equipped them to ensure colonies were both ‘virtuous and polite’. Without proper regard for religious observance, he warned, a colony would attract only ‘paupers, vagabonds and sluts’ and, amongst the higher orders, only men of desperate fortunes, flying from debt and dis- grace. ‘You would sow bad seed, plant sorry offsets, build with rotten materials: your colony would be disgusting’, he rounded.
 At home, there was increasing impatience with what Dickens described as a kind of ‘telescopic philanthropy’, and proselytising, Christianising lectures, ‘meetings in aid of missions to the Quashiboos, the Rumbatumbas, or the Oolalooloo cannibals’ were dismissed out  of hand by Sala, along with those Puritan hordes who subscribed ‘thousands of pounds yearly in an almost insane hope of converting heathen barbarians to a better faith’. In fact, a strong case was made that metropolitan observers did not understand the realities of colonial life. Conflict with the Xhosa, provided occasions for fierce denuncia- tions of humanitarianist views, and Charles Bunbury pronounced renewed Xhosa depredations in 1846 had exposed the ‘erroneous nature of some opinions, respecting the affairs of the Cape, which have been industriously inculcated by a numerous and active party in this country’. The ‘Exeter Hall interest’ as that humanitarian grouping of missionary societies, the Anti-Slavery Society and Aborigines Protection Society was increasingly dismissively termed, had been in the ascen- dant during the late 1830s and early 1840s but, from the mid 1840s, its authority was under challenge. Between 1836 and 1847 it had gained some support at the Colonial Office through James Stephen, Perma- nent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies and a member of the Committee of the Church Missionary Society, as well as from Parlia- ment’s willingness to legislate for the details of colonial policy. With the arrival of Earl Grey and Stephen’s successor, Herman Merivale, however, this began to change. The new Colonial Secretary left the details of colonial affairs largely to local discretion while, for his part, Merivale recognised that relations between settlers and indigenous populations were the product not so much of policies hatched at home as of the realities of the colonial situation. Alongside these develop- ments, contemporary pressure for self-government in Britain’s settler colonies, with its willing advocate in Earl Grey, had a profound effect on the discussion of relations between British settlers and indigenous populations. Colonists’ dreams of their ‘new nation’ rarely provided for the latter except in subservient roles. In his 1841 Lectures on Coloniza- tion and Colonies, Merivale had urged abandoning the practice of setting aside native reserves, arguing instead for amalgamation with European settlers as the necessary first step in a slow journey to civilisa- tion, as well as the peaceable and orderly progress of colonisation and, in an 1861 edition of the work, he adoringly footnoted George Grey’s particular success in forging settler and indigenous unity in New Zealand and the Cape by this means, extolling him as possessed of ‘the rare skill of entering into the savage mind and becoming ... intelligible to it’.12

 Ireland’s entanglements with England pre-date even those of Wales,  and the Irish had experienced considerable erosion of their liberties over  the years. English intrusions into Ireland date back to the thirteenth  century, and by the sixteenth century England was actively engaged in a  political, economic and religious subjugation of this neighbouring island.  The dates are anything but coincidental, for the bloodshed over religion  so characteristic of the Tudor years in England had deep and dangerous  consequences for Catholic Ireland. By the late sixteenth century, there was  some urgency to the policy of de-Catholicising Ireland through migration  and plantation, as England became defi nitively Anglican. A greater and  greater Protestant presence was imposed from the 1560s and for the next  hundred years, with a corresponding dispossession and pauperisation of  the Catholic Irish. When the Act of Union was passed in 1800 one promise  upon which the old Irish parliament insisted before they would dissolve  was that Catholics be allowed to vote and to hold public offi ce. It was  a promise that would remain unfulfi lled for a further three decades. In  March 1801, inability to keep that controversial promise prompted the  prime minister, William Pitt, to resign his offi ce.
 After 1801, the kingdom – now consisting of Scotland, Wales, Ireland  and England, together known as the United Kingdom – was governed  solely and as one from London. The state was more deeply centralised  than ever before; the term Great Britain, already in use, now became the  offi cial designation of the nation. Some historians have argued that  such centralisation was effective by 1640.  2   While this might be so in an  informal sense, we can certainly point to 1801, the dawn of the nineteenth  century, as a time when such centralising tendencies were fully and  formally in place and when internal colonialism was complete. While  Scotland retained a number of important local institutions, Britain had  one parliament and a state religion secured by a Protestant succession to  the monarchy.
 It was fear of destabilising this Protestant sovereignty that prompted  much of Britain’s internal colonialism. Ireland as a predominantly  Catholic region was the principal fl ashpoint for these religious debates  within imperial policy, but religion was politically signifi cant in Wales and  Scotland too. In Scotland, Catholicism had largely given way by 1690 to  a Calvinist-inspired Presbyterianism, under the infl uence of John Knox.  It was distinctively different in character from English Episcopalian  Christianity. The infl uence of Presbyterians amongst Protestant Irish  groups, mostly centred in northern Ireland, was of considerable concern  to English authorities in the eighteenth century. Presbyterianism in Scotland was acceptable, but its presence in Ireland added a complicating  additional layer of religious discontent and dissent that could only add to  England’s problems there; the Protestant Irish strand was the origin of the  Orange Movement, which quickly became deeply involved in political  protests in Ireland. Meanwhile, in Wales the insistence by the Anglican  Church that services be conducted solely in English secured a sturdy  support for non-Anglican forms of Protestantism. The successful spread  especially of Methodism and of Baptism owed much to the fact that these  new Protestant movements conducted services in the local language.  Likewise the translation of the Bible into Welsh, effected during the reign  of Elizabeth I, ensured that virtually every household in Wales would  continue to be exposed to the Welsh language even at a time when that  language was under attack. Welsh remained alive in large part because of  the actions of a monarch determined to impose Anglican conformity.
 Non-Anglican Protestants and Catholics throughout the kingdom were  barred from public offi ce – local or national – by the Corporation Act of  1661 and the Test Acts of 1673 and 1678. These laws were part of the  legal and political mechanism designed to protect a Protestant succession  to the throne and to resist reinstatement of the Catholic Stuart dynasty.  They also refl ected a popular and growing sentiment that parliament –  although hardly a representative institution at this time – was a speci- fi cally Protestant expression of liberty, what historian Linda Colley has  called the ‘Protestant inheritance’.  3   This celebration of Protestantism gave  voice to a profound and long-standing anti-Catholicism in England,  bolstered throughout the eighteenth century by the animosity between  England and its most signifi cant imperial and commercial rival, France.  Ironically, after the defeat of France in the Seven Years’ War in 1763,  Britain’s new colonial acquisitions made the Empire a far less identifi ably  Protestant one than it had formerly been. Catholics and non-Christians  fi gured largely among those now subject to British imperial rule. National  stability and success depended on more, of course, than merely a continued  adherence to Protestant Christianity. The needs of merchants and of  bankers were vital, and the mercantilist economic principles of England in  the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries meant that the state took a close  interest in trade and commerce, actively regulating economic life as a way  to pay government’s expenses. In the early eighteenth century, for example,  rarely a year passed in which a new law designed to regulate colonial trade  in some fashion, or to control customs revenue (and its enemy, piracy) did  not come before parliament. England kept a tight rein on colonial trade.  Colonial goods were governed by strict regulations which gave a strong advantage to the English economy. Scots merchants and traders gained  access to these lucrative colonial markets as a condition of the 1707 Act  of Union. This meant that they were no longer required to route goods  through England and pay duties on them, but could trade directly with  other colonies within the British Empire. For Ireland, the wait was longer.  An Act of 1696 had ruled that goods from the American plantations could  not be landed in Ireland, a law that hindered the logical trade that might  otherwise have fl ourished between America and Ireland, given their geo- graphical proximity. Though this restriction was eliminated in 1731, Irish  trade continued throughout the eighteenth century to be primarily with  England, a situation that gave England as the dominant trading partner  a considerable advantage.
 What made the American colonies so attractive? The story most often  told is, of course, that of the 1620 voyage aboard the  Mayfl ower  that  signals freedom of conscience and of religion, and certainly the Puritans  do fi gure signifi cantly in the early history of the American colonies. The  bulk of white settlers who came to the Americas were non-Anglican  Protestants, and in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the colonies  became known as places where small religious sects could fl ourish. One  important feature of American life was that, overall, there was no majority  religion and this partially explains the strong strand of religious toleration  that made America so distinctive. Only 2 of the 13 colonies – Massachusetts  and Connecticut – ever had formal state churches, a radically different  situation from Britain where the power of the Anglican Church prevented  Christian non-Anglicans as well as Catholics and Jews (as detailed in   Chapter   1   ) from enjoying full political participation.
 Not all of Britain’s Atlantic holdings were lost in 1783, of course.  American colonists who remained loyal to the English Crown often fl ed  north to the Canadian colonies, and these became an important site for  various important experiments in colonial governance. It would be in  British Canada that the new code of ‘responsible self-government’ would  fi rst be instituted. Canada posed some awkward problems for the colonial  state, however, since so many of its settler inhabitants were French and  Catholic, France having gained a considerable foothold in the North  Atlantic by the eighteenth century. Catholicism for the British was still, at  the time of American independence, tied symbolically to disloyalty; it was  not even a hundred years since the English state had secured a Protestant  succession to the throne and passed laws that prevented non-Anglicans  of all persuasions from holding public offi ce. The insistence in the new  American constitution on separating church and state was a reaction to  Britain’s restrictive and unequal religious divisions.
 Measures of reform almost always involved a critique of what were  seen as typically Indian behaviours or ideas, and implemented conduct  and values favoured by British elite culture. With each successive diminu- tion in Company power at the time of charter renewal, the metropolitan  voices of reform – spearheaded by free traders and evangelicals – became  more infl uential. Bolstered by Indian activism in many of the same areas  of concern, early nineteenth-century governments intervened ever more  closely in Indian religion, culture and social life. The effect was often to  emphasise the more conservative strands of local society. The Hindu  caste system, now enforced through the courts, became, if anything, more  pervasive and more stultifying, while Britain’s interest in maintaining  Indian princes as local rulers helped to keep tradition securely in place.  British economic policy discouraged competition with the metropole,  making large parts of India more rural and agrarian just as Europe was  industrialising.
 A substantial and important group of Britons living and working in  the Empire was the missionary contingent; by the end of the nineteenth  century there were some 10,000 British missionaries dotted across the  globe. It was in the late eighteenth century that British missionary work  in the Empire began to grow in earnest. Each of the major Christian  denominations in Britain founded missionary societies in the 1790s. The  missionary enterprise was, however, neither exclusively nor originally  aimed at the colonised. In the early North American colonies, missions  worked largely among the settler populations. It was in his missionary  work in the 1730s in colonial Georgia, North America, that John Wesley  garnered the ideas that would lead to one of the world’s most successful  branches of Christianity, Methodism. In British Canada, missionaries  were mostly concerned with the wanton behaviour of the miners, pro s- pectors, loggers and trappers who had emigrated from Britain and who  lived – and drank – hard in frontier communities. Even when attending to  colonial populations, missionary work began with the intent of converting  ruling groups, and not the lowly. The emphasis on non-settler colonies came, thus, quite late in missionary history, burgeoning towards the end  of the eighteenth century and dominating missionary activity thereafter.
 In these early years, colonial offi cials in both London and the colonies  were often suspicious of the missionaries, who had to fi ght for permission  to work in the colonies. They often faced suspicion and resentment not  only from those they sought to convert, but also from colonial offi cials,  for the missionaries were frequently critical of colonial practice and expert  at making public their unfl attering opinions of colonial governments.  Missionaries had been in the forefront of anti-slavery protests and were  seldom reluctant to criticise what they saw as colonial exploitation of  indigenous peoples. In the nineteenth century, missionaries spread across  the colonial globe and could be found in the West Indies and the Pacifi c,  in Africa and in India, in South-East Asia and the Chinese treaty ports and  in North America. Over time, governments and missionaries came closer  together, but missionaries nonetheless often had a quite complex role in  the colonial world, promoting western values through conversion, but  often vocally critical of imperial policy and practice. In the case of par- ticularly active critics among the missionaries, colonial governments  shared information about their whereabouts, travel and activities so as  to minimise any political damage to government that might ensue from  their work.
 In common with many other colonies, there were important differences  in the goals of urban and rural activists, but it was perhaps the difference  between those who emphasised Burma’s Buddhist legacy and those who  favoured a more westernised and secularised nationalism wedded to mod- er nisation that ran deepest in Burmese nationalism. As in other colonial  settings, the divide between those who wanted to embrace a western style  of politics and those who rejected what the west offered was a strong and  a divisive factor. Rural rebellion, student strikes and riots were common  in the interwar years, and in 1935 the Government of Burma Act separated  Burma from India (as of 1937) and extended its self-governance consider- ably. As elsewhere, the central policy areas of defence, foreign affairs and  fi nance remained under British control, a move that encouraged and deep- ened anti-colonial beliefs. As in Indian nationalist circles in the 1940s,  some in Burma also allied with Japan in an anti-western political gesture.

 14 For instance, by the turn of the twentieth century the Turkish nationalist movement sought to establish a more thoroughly ethnically Turkish government  and nation- state.
 But it was the French example that had served as the much more influential model for revolutions in the nineteenth and twentieth cen- turies. It was one in which political power was constitutionally linked with issues of social uplift and in which, moreover, French national unity was grounded on the shared material destitution of the archetype of the French citizen, namely the French peasant. Citizenship was thus from the very outset a response to a social predicament, and the power of the state was similarly a promissory rejoinder to redress that predica- ment. The French constitutional legacy has been overwhelmingly influ- ential in the subsequent history of revolutions and in post-imperial constitutionalism. In the founding of new nations and the writing of new constitutions, and thus in the articulation of the powers of the state, the commitment to social uplift and equality has in fact been front and centre of such enterprises. And so it was in India too.
 Channel Islands, and Scotland after the Act of Union.5 What became the British Crown was therefore, like almost all early modern European dynastic states, a composite one.6 Like many of them, and even before it acquired transoceanic colonies, it was aboriginally an empire in the sense of being a single domain, within which internal jurisdictions were differently related to the centre.7
 canvassed. But the other dimension derived from this ecclesiastical imperium exercised by the monarch. There was no established imperial church in America—even episcopalian Virginia’s bishops were not roy- ally appointed. Collectively America was congregational. The structure of British imperium there—as in Ireland—was doubly fractured.
 Both before and after Madoc, Southey struggled to find an enabling myth of benign white colonial settlement, along with a credible, mythic founding father. Before he chose the subject of Madoc, he considered writing an epic on Brutus, the legendary Trojan founder of Britain, and a much favoured emblem, in numerous seventeenth- and eighteenth- century projected or half-finished epics, of enlightened colonisation.33
 However much his views may have hardened, Southey clung on to the idea that state-sponsored colonisation offered some redress for poverty and social exclusion, even if that redress stopped far short of the redistribution of property advocated in his earliest works. His vision of the colonial future also retained the flavour of the Romantic agrarian republicanism evident in his Quarterly essay on Malthus cited above, where he stated that it does not matter whether the colonies separate from the mother country so long as they remain enclaves of British yeomanry. For Southey, the idea of portable, emigrant Britishness was not straight- forwardly part of an aspiration for global dominance, and he recognised and welcomed the fact that all colonial settlements, like those of Wordsworth’s Dalesmen, had an inbuilt republican logic of separation.
 emigration debate, Wakefield gave the highest priority to the colonies’ potential economic advantage to Britain, and, though he was concerned in all his promotional works with the development of cohesive and well governed colonial societies, he never accepted that eventual separation was either desirable or inevitable. Yet he also acknowledged a debt (largely ignored by his intellectual biographers, and denied by him in subsequent works) to Wilmot-Horton and to Tory colonial thinking about the possibility of reconstituting British society in the colonies. His vision for the colonies was, certainly, altogether more urban and more geared towards investment opportunities for the metropolis than to solutions to poverty at the colonial margins. He had no time for Wilmot- Horton’s ideal of peasant proprietors, but he did have a residually Romantic preoccupation with the nature and meaning of settlement, the personal qualities needed for an emigrant to achieve rootedness, and the superior talent of the English (as opposed to Americans) for avoiding savage wildness and stamping their humanity on the wilderness. He also had as a goal the creation of a property-owning, largely self-governing society with enough leisure to support a colonial intellectual class (and he was broadly in favour of ending the transportation of convicts to Australia). Wakefield’s ideas influenced the Whig-initiated Ripon Land Regulations mandating the end of free grants of land in New South Wales, and he was subsequently instrumental in the founding of South Australia, in the constitution of greater self-government for Canada, and in leading the push—in the teeth of considerable domestic support for Maori rights—for the Crown’s annexation of New Zealand. Thereafter, he devoted his energies to promoting self-government for New Zealand, emigrating there himself in 1852. In all this, he remained committed to a vision of the British colony, not simply as a replication of the mother- land, but as a place of graduated opportunities for personal independ- ence for (strictly only) white settlers through dedication and hard work. Despite his public repudiation of the Tory and Romantic ideal of the colonies as agrarian communities, he did retain something of that Tory understanding of emigration as a project of national recuperation.
 For the domestic supporters of these colonies, their existence and slow flourishing showed Britain’s capacity to offer social uplift to those white inhabitants living within its extended colonial polity, and, in showing that capacity, to demonstrate its fitness for imperial trusteeship elsewhere in the world.
 how the end of Empire reverberated beyond the state has led me to explore its  impact on the domestic Church of England.14
 The British polity, however, was pluralistic in character and these institutions  had acquired or been given a sense of agency, reflecting the distinctive nature  of British political culture. They could not operate entirely independently of the  state, but, even if subject in principle to ministerial control, still acted with con- siderable autonomy. As Patrick Joyce argues, the British state, as it developed in  the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, was a ‘liberal’ one, not only because it was  based on principles of political liberty, but also because it was one which permit- ted persons, places or institutions, which Joyce describes as ‘designated governed  entities’, to operate ‘ostensibly on their own, without outside interference’.15 What  is more these might be perceived as distinct from the British state, and their sepa- rate identities would be important in their ability to negotiate a changing overseas  landscape brought about by decolonization. Within the British system institu- tions beyond the state also contributed to the business of governance, as Oxford  and Cambridge did by training Britain’s imperial administrators. Further, within  British political culture there was a consensus even among public servants (in 14  Sarah Stockwell, ‘ “Splendidly Leading the Way?” Archbishop Fisher and Decolonisation in  British Colonial Africa’ in Robert Holland and Sarah Stockwell eds., Ambiguities of Empire:  Essays in Honour of Andrew Porter (Routledge, London, 2009), pp. 199–218; Sarah Stockwell,  ‘ “Improper and Even Unconstitutional”: The Involvement of the Church of England in the  Politics of End of Empire in Cyprus’ in S.

 On a spectrum from ‘state’ to ‘nonstate’ the universities of Oxford and  Cambridge, while from their medieval foundation intended to serve the twin  needs of church and state, were in some respects more obviously at the periph- ery, although from the mid- nineteenth century they became subject to greater  state regulation. Legislation in 1854 and 1856 intervened to make them less  religiously exclusive, which together with the Northcote- Trevelyan civil ser- vice reforms, aimed at the creation of a public service class. Further legislation  in 1877 stipulated that research and teaching should be among the aims of the  universities, while governments also had patronage over some key university  appointments. The establishment of the University Grants Committee (UGC)  in 1919 and introduction of state funding, in 1923 to Oxbridge, but earlier else- where, represented a further development in the relationship of universities to  the state with the new Committee instituting quinquennial university reviews.  The universities nonetheless retained considerable independence from the  state, with government funding accounting for only a proportion of university  income and the UGC not inclined towards intervention.20
 The Royal Mint has attracted little attention from historians of imperialism.  Yet it has been judged to have been by 1914 ‘one of the great institutions of the  British Empire’.96 Although, as we shall see, a decline in its direct involvement  in some parts of the Empire, specifically the old Commonwealth, would occur  in the middle decades of the twentieth century, these years would neverthe- less see the colonial Empire, including Britain’s African colonies, assume an  enhanced commercial importance to the Mint.
 After 1801, the kingdom – now consisting of Scotland, Wales, Ireland and England – was governed solely and as one from London. The state was more deeply centralized than ever before; the term Great Britain, already in use, was now the official designation of the nation. Some his- torians have argued that such centralization was effective by 1640.1 This might be so in an informal sense, but we can certainly point to 1801,  the dawn of the nineteenth century, as a time when such centralizing  tendencies were fully and formally in place and when internal colonialism was complete. Although Scotland retained a number of important local institutions, Britain had one parliament and a state religion secured by a Protestant succession to the monarchy.
 It was fear of destabilizing this Protestant sovereignty that prompted much of Britain’s internal colonialism. Ireland as a predominantly Catholic region was the principal flashpoint for these religious debates within imperial policy, but religion was politically significant in Wales and Scotland too. In Scotland, Catholicism had largely given way by 1690 to  a Calvinist-inspired Presbyterianism, under the influence of John Knox.  It was distinctively different in character from English Episcopalian Christianity. The influence of Presbyterians among Protestant Irish groups, mostly centred in northern Ireland, was of considerable concern to the English authorities in the eighteenth century. Presbyterianism in Scotland was acceptable, but its presence in Ireland added a complicating addi- tional layer of religious discontent and dissent that could only add to England’s problems there; the Protestant Irish strand was the origin of the Orange Movement, which quickly became deeply involved in political protests in Ireland. Meanwhile, in Wales the insistence by the Anglican Church that services be conducted solely in English secured sturdy  support for non-Anglican forms of Protestantism. The successful spread especially of Methodism and of Baptism owed much to the fact that they conducted services in the local language. Likewise the translation of the .
 Non-Anglican Protestants and Catholics throughout the kingdom were barred from public office, local or national, by the Corporation Act of 1661 and the Test Acts of 1673 and 1678. These laws were part of the legal and political mechanism designed to protect a Protestant succession to the throne and to resist reinstatement of the Catholic Stuart dynasty. They also reflected a popular and growing sentiment that parliament  – although hardly a representative institution at this time – was a specifically Protestant expression of liberty, what historian Linda Colley has called the ‘Protestant inheritance’.2 This celebration of Protestantism gave voice to a profound and long-standing anti-Catholicism in England, bolstered throughout the eighteenth century by the animosity between England and its most significant imperial and commercial rival, France. Ironically, after the defeat of France in the Seven Years War in 1763, Britain’s new colonial acquisitions made the Empire a far less identifiably Protestant one than it had formerly been. Catholics and non-Christians figured largely among those now subject to British imperial rule.
 Even before formal annexation, the dependency of Wales, Scotland and Ireland was high among English priorities. The 1720 Declaratory Act passed at Westminster was, in its own words, ‘for the better securing  the dependency of Ireland upon the crown of Great Britain’. The Act made laws passed at Westminster binding on Ireland and also ensured that appeals cases originating in Ireland were heard in England, thereby  formalizing judicial control from the centre as well. This assertion of a central authority via a Declaratory Act was, interestingly, also tried  with regard to the American colonies in 1766, proclaiming parliament’s  right to legislate on behalf of the colonies in the wake of a quantity of unpopular and vigorously resisted legislation. Not surprisingly, neither the colonial assemblies in the Americas nor the Irish parliament welcomed such laws. The Irish Act of 1720 was repealed in 1782, and not insig- nificantly after the surrender of Lord Cornwallis’s troops at Yorktown, a symbolically important colonial defeat for the English state, ending the American Revolution (see Chapter 3).
 What made the American colonies so attractive? The story most often told is, of course, that of the 1629 voyage aboard the Mayflower that  signals freedom of conscience and of religion, and certainly the Puritans do figure significantly in the early history of the American colonies. The bulk of white settlers who came to the Americas were non-Anglican Protestants, and in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the colonies became known as places where small religious sects could flourish. One important feature of American life was that, overall, there was no major- ity religion, which partially explains the strong strand of religious  toleration that made America so distinctive. Only two of the 13 colonies  – Massachusetts and Connecticut – ever had formal state churches, a  radically different situation from Britain where the power of the Anglican Church prevented Christian non-Anglicans as well as Catholics and Jews from enjoying full political participation.
 Not all of Britain’s Atlantic holdings were lost in 1783, of course. American colonists who remained loyal to the English Crown often fled north to the Canadian colonies, and these became an important site for various experiments in colonial governance. It would be in British Canada that the new code of ‘responsible self-government’ would first be insti- tuted. Canada posed some awkward problems for the colonial state, how- ever, since so many of its settler inhabitants were French and Catholic, France having gained a considerable foothold in the north Atlantic by the eighteenth century. Catholicism for the British was still, at the time of American independence, tied symbolically to disloyalty; it was not even a hundred years since the English state had secured a Protestant succession to the throne and passed laws that prevented non-Anglicans of all persua- sions from holding public office. The insistence in the new American .
 constitution on separating Church and State was a reaction to Britain’s restrictive and unequal religious divisions.
 With so many migrants arriving, settlements spread further and further and new colonies beyond New South Wales were created. By the late 1850s there were six colonies, by no means identical in population, pol- itics or governance, but a sure sign that what, from 1814 or so, was called Australia would endure. The Swan River Colony was first established in 1829, and that of South Australia in 1836. The founding of new colonies was prompted not only by the tide of emigration from Britain but by a variety of local political interests as well. As had been the case with Van Diemen’s Land in 1802–3, the Swan River Colony was initiated in large part to deter the French from attempting any settlements, this time in the south-west. Planned initially as a settlement solely of voluntary migrants, although including those under indenture, the struggles of the early resid- ents led to the late introduction of transportation in 1850. Despite the Swan River Colony’s desire to be convict-free, it would be, as we have seen, the last of the colonies to abolish transportation.
 Measures of reform almost always involved a critique of what were seen as typically Indian behaviours or ideas, and implemented conduct and values favoured by British elite culture. With each successive diminution .
 Both in Britain and in the colonies there were groups who saw a  troubling gap between these rather fervent expositions of the moral good of empire and actual practice. The Aborigines’ Protection Society (APS), founded in London in 1836, constantly lamented the degradations visited upon aboriginal peoples by British colonists. They too saw the colonized as weaker and inferior, and it was in imperialism’s failure to protect the weak that their protests against colonialism lay. The APS held that ‘in pro- portion to their inherent feebleness is the strength of their claim to the paternal care of the Government’.7 It was the action of those living in the colonies that, they argued, required control. Humanitarians mostly failed in their efforts to control the course of colonization, but their voices form nonetheless an important part of the landscape of imperialism.
 A substantial and important group of Britons living and working in  the Empire was the missionary contingent; by the end of the nineteenth century there were around 10,000 British missionaries dotted across the globe. It was in the late eighteenth century that British missionary work in the Empire really began to grow. Each of the major Christian denomina- tions in Britain founded missionary societies in the 1790s. The missionary enterprise was, however, neither exclusively nor originally aimed at the colonial poor. In the early North American colonies, missions worked largely among the settler populations. It was in his missionary work in colonial Georgia in the 1730s that John Wesley garnered the ideas that would lead to one of the world’s most successful branches of Christianity, Methodism. In British Canada, missionaries were mostly concerned with the wanton behaviour of the miners, prospectors, loggers and trappers who had emigrated from Britain and who lived – and drank – hard in frontier communities. However, even when attending to colonial popula- tions, missionary work began with the never successful intent of convert- ing ruling groups, and not the lowly. The emphasis on non-settler colonies thus came quite late in missionary history, burgeoning at the end of the eighteenth century.
 Also in the 1950s the Reverend Guthrie Michael Scott founded the Africa Bureau, an organization committed to advising anti-colonial .
 The Status Quo  a n d the A dm i n istr ation  of the Holy Pl aces One of the urgent and sensitive challenges that faced the OETA administration  was the administration of the Holy Places in Jerusalem. Th e British policy toward  these sites was based on the Ottoman framework, which was introduced to Jeru- salem by the Ottoman authorities in 1852 (based on an even earlier position from  1757), referring mainly to the Holy Sepulchre and its legal status, and giving par- amount position to the Orthodox Church. Th e Ottomans originally introduced  the concept of “Th e Status Quo in the Holy Places” as an attempt to regulate the  right of control and access to the Christian holy sites in Jerusalem and Palestine.  Th e status quo was settled by a series of documents and decrees that were set by  the Ottoman Sultan Abdül Mecid in 1852, following the old dispute between the  Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and the Roman Catholic Church, which resulted  with the subsequent intervention of European powers in the Crimean War. Th e  decree, which was later confi rmed in the Congress of Berlin in 1878, established  the rights of several churches in relation to the Holy Places, including the ways  of public worship, decorations used in the shrines, and the ways of usage and  exercising ceremonies and rites.43

 The inconsistency between fact and the orthodox interpretation arises in yet another way. For all the extensive anthologies of opinion supposedly hostile to colonies, how many colonies were actually abandoned? For instance, the West Africa Committee of 1865 made a strong and much quoted case for giving up all but one of the West African settlements, but even as they sat these settlements were being extended. The Indian empire, however, is the most glaring gap in the traditional explanation. Its history in the 'period of indifference' is filled with wars and annexations.
 According to Ismaili sources the Ismaili movement, from its beginnings in the year 808, was largely engaged in the establishment of a remarkable network of emissaries who came to constitute the da’wa, often inadequately rendered into English as ‘mission’ or ‘propaganda’.21
 WHILE England was planting new colonies in South Africa, let us see how her older colonies in Canada were progressing.
 and also would have destabilised the “civilising mission” and Britain’s  moral authority in colonies.145

 in the colonies was that of Anglican clergyman.39These changes may have done something to narrow the intellectual and social distance between them and Whitehall; they also tended to widen the gap between them and the non-official white community in their colony. Like Judges, Governors were moved around a good deal. The average length of a governorship in our period was less than five years, and one rarely lasted more than seven years. Governors thus had a commitment to the Empire as a whole much more than to the particular colony they were administering. Like Judges, Governors (and Colonial Secretaries, who often were promoted to gov- ernorships) tended to enforce a common pattern of rule based on instructions received from Whitehall.40 Further, as not only men of Government but professional gentlemen, they often held low opinions of the scantily educated commercial men seeking to make their fortune in the colonies by farming or by trade.
 Besides settlers and traders, there was a small number of clergy and missionaries in Fiji, chiefly Methodist, filling no simple single role and holding no single view. On the whole, those involved in spreading Christianity and in ministering to native Fijians were very critical of settlers’ treatment of them; but other clergy, attached to settlements, tended to share the enthusiasm of their congregants for further white settlement and economic development. The editor of the Fiji Times was himself a Methodist lay preacher. As the example of Sir William McArthur demonstrates, it was not hard to see in the South Seas “commerce and Christianity” advancing hand in hand.
 The Whitehall indulgence shown to Gordon was underpinned by his high social and political position, unusual for a colonial Governor.

 Representing the colony on various diplomatic missions seems to have given him an interest in colonial government in a warmer clime.
 Until about 1951-2, as one authority on the Sudan has^written;  secular nationalism ‘hardly deserves to be, called “popular**; it was  still the cult of the white collar elite rather than a genuine mass  movement*.35 Secular nationalism developed within the context of  the Khatmia-Ansar «conflict. The political party associated with the  Khatmia/was the ‘Ashigga*, and the political party of the Mahdi and  the Ansar sect was the ‘Umma*. The British archives reveal a sophisti­ cated contemporary understanding of their religious foundations.  British estimates were also particularly concerned, to establish the  extent of dominance of member of the two parties, in the civil  service and the penetration of political influence into the rural areas  as well as the towns. According to British reports in the 1949-51  period, 4he Khatmia sect embraced ‘about half the educated popula­ tion, of ,$he North*, and the Ashigga predominated amqng the  ‘Graduates.*, meaning those Sudanese who ppssess^dat lea>st,a primary  education in English.

 Ireland’s entanglements with England pre-date even those of Wales,  and the Irish had experienced considerable erosion of their liberties over  the years. English intrusions into Ireland date back to the thirteenth  century, and by the sixteenth century England was actively engaged in a  political, economic and religious subjugation of this neighbouring island.  The dates are anything but coincidental, for the bloodshed over religion  so characteristic of the Tudor years in England had deep and dangerous  consequences for Catholic Ireland. By the late sixteenth century, there was  some urgency to the policy of de-Catholicising Ireland through migration  and plantation, as England became defi nitively Anglican. A greater and  greater Protestant presence was imposed from the 1560s and for the next  hundred years, with a corresponding dispossession and pauperisation of  the Catholic Irish. When the Act of Union was passed in 1800 one promise  upon which the old Irish parliament insisted before they would dissolve  was that Catholics be allowed to vote and to hold public offi ce. It was  a promise that would remain unfulfi lled for a further three decades. In  March 1801, inability to keep that controversial promise prompted the  prime minister, William Pitt, to resign his offi ce.
 After 1801, the kingdom – now consisting of Scotland, Wales, Ireland  and England, together known as the United Kingdom – was governed  solely and as one from London. The state was more deeply centralised  than ever before; the term Great Britain, already in use, now became the  offi cial designation of the nation. Some historians have argued that  such centralisation was effective by 1640.  2   While this might be so in an  informal sense, we can certainly point to 1801, the dawn of the nineteenth  century, as a time when such centralising tendencies were fully and  formally in place and when internal colonialism was complete. While  Scotland retained a number of important local institutions, Britain had  one parliament and a state religion secured by a Protestant succession to  the monarchy.
 It was fear of destabilising this Protestant sovereignty that prompted  much of Britain’s internal colonialism. Ireland as a predominantly  Catholic region was the principal fl ashpoint for these religious debates  within imperial policy, but religion was politically signifi cant in Wales and  Scotland too. In Scotland, Catholicism had largely given way by 1690 to  a Calvinist-inspired Presbyterianism, under the infl uence of John Knox.  It was distinctively different in character from English Episcopalian  Christianity. The infl uence of Presbyterians amongst Protestant Irish  groups, mostly centred in northern Ireland, was of considerable concern  to English authorities in the eighteenth century. Presbyterianism in Scotland was acceptable, but its presence in Ireland added a complicating  additional layer of religious discontent and dissent that could only add to  England’s problems there; the Protestant Irish strand was the origin of the  Orange Movement, which quickly became deeply involved in political  protests in Ireland. Meanwhile, in Wales the insistence by the Anglican  Church that services be conducted solely in English secured a sturdy  support for non-Anglican forms of Protestantism. The successful spread  especially of Methodism and of Baptism owed much to the fact that these  new Protestant movements conducted services in the local language.  Likewise the translation of the Bible into Welsh, effected during the reign  of Elizabeth I, ensured that virtually every household in Wales would  continue to be exposed to the Welsh language even at a time when that  language was under attack. Welsh remained alive in large part because of  the actions of a monarch determined to impose Anglican conformity.
 Non-Anglican Protestants and Catholics throughout the kingdom were  barred from public offi ce – local or national – by the Corporation Act of  1661 and the Test Acts of 1673 and 1678. These laws were part of the  legal and political mechanism designed to protect a Protestant succession  to the throne and to resist reinstatement of the Catholic Stuart dynasty.  They also refl ected a popular and growing sentiment that parliament –  although hardly a representative institution at this time – was a speci- fi cally Protestant expression of liberty, what historian Linda Colley has  called the ‘Protestant inheritance’.  3   This celebration of Protestantism gave  voice to a profound and long-standing anti-Catholicism in England,  bolstered throughout the eighteenth century by the animosity between  England and its most signifi cant imperial and commercial rival, France.  Ironically, after the defeat of France in the Seven Years’ War in 1763,  Britain’s new colonial acquisitions made the Empire a far less identifi ably  Protestant one than it had formerly been. Catholics and non-Christians  fi gured largely among those now subject to British imperial rule. National  stability and success depended on more, of course, than merely a continued  adherence to Protestant Christianity. The needs of merchants and of  bankers were vital, and the mercantilist economic principles of England in  the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries meant that the state took a close  interest in trade and commerce, actively regulating economic life as a way  to pay government’s expenses. In the early eighteenth century, for example,  rarely a year passed in which a new law designed to regulate colonial trade  in some fashion, or to control customs revenue (and its enemy, piracy) did  not come before parliament. England kept a tight rein on colonial trade.  Colonial goods were governed by strict regulations which gave a strong advantage to the English economy. Scots merchants and traders gained  access to these lucrative colonial markets as a condition of the 1707 Act  of Union. This meant that they were no longer required to route goods  through England and pay duties on them, but could trade directly with  other colonies within the British Empire. For Ireland, the wait was longer.  An Act of 1696 had ruled that goods from the American plantations could  not be landed in Ireland, a law that hindered the logical trade that might  otherwise have fl ourished between America and Ireland, given their geo- graphical proximity. Though this restriction was eliminated in 1731, Irish  trade continued throughout the eighteenth century to be primarily with  England, a situation that gave England as the dominant trading partner  a considerable advantage.
 What made the American colonies so attractive? The story most often  told is, of course, that of the 1620 voyage aboard the  Mayfl ower  that  signals freedom of conscience and of religion, and certainly the Puritans  do fi gure signifi cantly in the early history of the American colonies. The  bulk of white settlers who came to the Americas were non-Anglican  Protestants, and in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the colonies  became known as places where small religious sects could fl ourish. One  important feature of American life was that, overall, there was no majority  religion and this partially explains the strong strand of religious toleration  that made America so distinctive. Only 2 of the 13 colonies – Massachusetts  and Connecticut – ever had formal state churches, a radically different  situation from Britain where the power of the Anglican Church prevented  Christian non-Anglicans as well as Catholics and Jews (as detailed in   Chapter   1   ) from enjoying full political participation.
 Not all of Britain’s Atlantic holdings were lost in 1783, of course.  American colonists who remained loyal to the English Crown often fl ed  north to the Canadian colonies, and these became an important site for  various important experiments in colonial governance. It would be in  British Canada that the new code of ‘responsible self-government’ would  fi rst be instituted. Canada posed some awkward problems for the colonial  state, however, since so many of its settler inhabitants were French and  Catholic, France having gained a considerable foothold in the North  Atlantic by the eighteenth century. Catholicism for the British was still, at  the time of American independence, tied symbolically to disloyalty; it was  not even a hundred years since the English state had secured a Protestant  succession to the throne and passed laws that prevented non-Anglicans  of all persuasions from holding public offi ce. The insistence in the new  American constitution on separating church and state was a reaction to  Britain’s restrictive and unequal religious divisions.
 Measures of reform almost always involved a critique of what were  seen as typically Indian behaviours or ideas, and implemented conduct  and values favoured by British elite culture. With each successive diminu- tion in Company power at the time of charter renewal, the metropolitan  voices of reform – spearheaded by free traders and evangelicals – became  more infl uential. Bolstered by Indian activism in many of the same areas  of concern, early nineteenth-century governments intervened ever more  closely in Indian religion, culture and social life. The effect was often to  emphasise the more conservative strands of local society. The Hindu  caste system, now enforced through the courts, became, if anything, more  pervasive and more stultifying, while Britain’s interest in maintaining  Indian princes as local rulers helped to keep tradition securely in place.  British economic policy discouraged competition with the metropole,  making large parts of India more rural and agrarian just as Europe was  industrialising.
 A substantial and important group of Britons living and working in  the Empire was the missionary contingent; by the end of the nineteenth  century there were some 10,000 British missionaries dotted across the  globe. It was in the late eighteenth century that British missionary work  in the Empire began to grow in earnest. Each of the major Christian  denominations in Britain founded missionary societies in the 1790s. The  missionary enterprise was, however, neither exclusively nor originally  aimed at the colonised. In the early North American colonies, missions  worked largely among the settler populations. It was in his missionary  work in the 1730s in colonial Georgia, North America, that John Wesley  garnered the ideas that would lead to one of the world’s most successful  branches of Christianity, Methodism. In British Canada, missionaries  were mostly concerned with the wanton behaviour of the miners, pro s- pectors, loggers and trappers who had emigrated from Britain and who  lived – and drank – hard in frontier communities. Even when attending to  colonial populations, missionary work began with the intent of converting  ruling groups, and not the lowly. The emphasis on non-settler colonies came, thus, quite late in missionary history, burgeoning towards the end  of the eighteenth century and dominating missionary activity thereafter.
 In these early years, colonial offi cials in both London and the colonies  were often suspicious of the missionaries, who had to fi ght for permission  to work in the colonies. They often faced suspicion and resentment not  only from those they sought to convert, but also from colonial offi cials,  for the missionaries were frequently critical of colonial practice and expert  at making public their unfl attering opinions of colonial governments.  Missionaries had been in the forefront of anti-slavery protests and were  seldom reluctant to criticise what they saw as colonial exploitation of  indigenous peoples. In the nineteenth century, missionaries spread across  the colonial globe and could be found in the West Indies and the Pacifi c,  in Africa and in India, in South-East Asia and the Chinese treaty ports and  in North America. Over time, governments and missionaries came closer  together, but missionaries nonetheless often had a quite complex role in  the colonial world, promoting western values through conversion, but  often vocally critical of imperial policy and practice. In the case of par- ticularly active critics among the missionaries, colonial governments  shared information about their whereabouts, travel and activities so as  to minimise any political damage to government that might ensue from  their work.
 In common with many other colonies, there were important differences  in the goals of urban and rural activists, but it was perhaps the difference  between those who emphasised Burma’s Buddhist legacy and those who  favoured a more westernised and secularised nationalism wedded to mod- er nisation that ran deepest in Burmese nationalism. As in other colonial  settings, the divide between those who wanted to embrace a western style  of politics and those who rejected what the west offered was a strong and  a divisive factor. Rural rebellion, student strikes and riots were common  in the interwar years, and in 1935 the Government of Burma Act separated  Burma from India (as of 1937) and extended its self-governance consider- ably. As elsewhere, the central policy areas of defence, foreign affairs and  fi nance remained under British control, a move that encouraged and deep- ened anti-colonial beliefs. As in Indian nationalist circles in the 1940s,  some in Burma also allied with Japan in an anti-western political gesture.

 Like many in the service of the British Empire, Thomas Lewin’s involvement in India ran in the family. In 1841, his uncle Lieutenant  William Charles James Lewin, a commissioned officer in the Bengal  Artillery, found himself sitting out his eighth monsoon season since  transferring to the Invalid Establishment at Cherrapunji in the Khasi Hills in 1833. His health still shattered from the rigours of the Anglo-Burmese  War the decade before, Lewin, his wife Jane and their five children could still welcome the Welsh missionaries Thomas and Anne Jones  to share their cramped and damp quarters. Chronically ill and never financially secure enough to return ‘home’ with his family to England, William Lewin died of jungle-fever in 1846. His own career trajectory and ultimate demise was a case study in the flux of circumstance and  sensibility. Lewin had, for example, undergone a spiritual awakening on  his 1822 voyage to India as a young cadet, and on his arrival he read the  Bible every day, a practice that deviated from the desirable affiliations of the soldiery (Anglican, Presbyterian or Catholic) and which isolated  him from his comrades: ‘suspicions began to be entertained that I was  somewhat “methodistical,” and thenceforth I stood alone’.43

 Nevertheless, in a sharp contrast with the official roles played by Indians  in the organization of the British Empire Exhibition, the modern blend- ing of cultures represented by elite creoles played virtually no official role.  Creole communities in West Africa had roots far back in the nineteenth  century, in the establishment of Freetown as a site for repatriated former slaves.42 West African creoles had for generations spoken English, read “English” literature, subscribed to British journals, participated in Prot- estant worship services, sent their children to British universities, and in the nineteenth century had served the colonial administration in many  functions. They formed a small minority of West Africans, and in the  nineteenth century they had enjoyed generally good relations with British  traders, missionaries, and colonial officials. However, by the turn of the  century creoles were a community under economic and political threat  from an aggressive British colonialism underpinned by a stark racism. Cre- oles who had in the nineteenth century enjoyed professional status and posts in the colonial service were increasingly excluded from political life, relegated to token representation in colonial legislative assemblies with only consultative powers.

 America. The terms “Americas” and “America” are used to describe the entire continental mass and the Caribbean. Otherwise, “America” will be preceded by a qualifier, as in “French America” or “British America.” Toward the end of the colonial period, the use of “America” to describe the colonies and “Americans” to describe colonists in British North America reflects the way the term was used contemporaneously.
 In the decades since that comment, historians’ views of the “actual nature of the colonial world” have changed. Historians now recreate a colonial world that includes not only the broad cultural and political themes of the older history but also the roles of natives, slaves, women, and families in its development. There is a lingering temptation to look back from the Revolution and its unifying outcome to see the colonies as a nursery for the confederated Republic and not as the rather separated parts they were. These colonies certainly did not have the Revolution on their horizons. When John Winthrop in 1630 recited his striking “city on the hill” scriptural metaphor for the Christian experiment in Massachusetts, he was not thinking of Jefferson’s, Lincoln’s, or Obama’s vision of the United States of America. The social objective of Winthrop and his group was at once more limited, measuring “community” in a narrower way than nationhood, and more strongly ecclesiastical, looking for a way to regenerate the Church of England in an American exile—their “errand into the wilderness.” The term “Zion” (or “Sion”) crops up in some of the Puritans’ descriptions of their exclusive community. A recent and stimulating biography by Francis J. Bremer, John Winthrop: America’s Forgotten Founding Father (2003), calls Winthrop a “founder” with a legacy that survives in the greater American community. Suffice to say that Winthrop is certainly a founder of colonial Massachusetts. He died in 1649, his deeply spiritual vision not quite realized. It is still not realized. One wonders what he might have thought of today’s America and its use of his “city on the hill” image as a slogan for national identity and purpose. Winthrop of Massachusetts, John Smith of Virginia, and William Penn of Pennsylvania, along with the other colonial “founders,” each had a separate vision for the future of their enterprises. However, they hardly saw what they were doing as building blocks to a colonial union let alone to a national collective in America.
 Galileo ran afoul of the Inquisition, the Roman Catholic Church’s formal agency for monitoring the spiritual habits of the population, ferreting out heretics and dissenters, and enforcing orthodoxy. The Inquisition was less active in northern Europe but was a potent force in the Mediterranean world, especially in Spain. It was also busy in the Italian city-states. In Florence the Inquisition’s prosecution of Galileo was a bit of an anomaly, given the way the church had encouraged scientific enquiry, especially in the universities. Still, he was placed under house arrest. Yet in spite of the reactionary behavior of the Church, the era was marked by vocal and aggressive intellectual and spiritual innovation. There was no rigid dichotomy between the secular and the profane but rather an apparent rise in interest in the role of mankind in God’s universe. Importantly, the Church’s domination was not threatened by any external secular movement but was challenged from within. The Protestant Reformation grew out of the Church of Rome’s dominant place in all of Europe’s civil, diplomatic, intellectual, and spiritual matters.
 While Erasmus was more influential than earlier Christian philosophers in his approach to human understanding, he had predecessors. Nearly two centuries earlier, the Florentine writer Francesco Petrarch (1304–1374) had touched off what came to be the humanist proclivity of searching for new understanding by rummaging through classical texts and ideas. He and generations of thinkers brought to the Renaissance a way of seeing the world from a human perspective while adding to the glory of God. Erasmus was more reflective than tactical, even though he argued for a church that opened itself to popular needs. However, his editorial advice was superseded by that of Martin Luther, who made a direct and revolutionary attack on the Roman Church. It was Luther’s denunciation of the Catholic Church’s authority and the birth of the Protestant movement, rather than Erasmus’s reasoning or that of other activist intellectuals, that opened up one of the most dynamic movements of early modern Europe, the Reformation. The breaking of the Church of Rome’s control of Christian practices in Europe would eventually emerge in the North American colonies of the English and Dutch.
 Protestantism, in its many variants, became firmly settled in places like Scotland, Holland, Bohemia, Scandinavia, and England. By the end of the eighteenth century in Europe and North America, it had spawned Anglicans, Presbyterians, Separatists, Puritans, Baptists, Methodists, Quakers, Dutch and German Reformed, Dunkers, Shakers, Mennonites, and a plethora of smaller and evolving sects. It added breadth, variety, and energy to the ecclesiastical and theological underpinning of Christian culture. It also encouraged social and political innovation. Its mark on America is profound, and it stands as an important historical determinant in any comparison with the Catholic Spanish, Portuguese, and French presence. As for Luther, he left behind a huge published body of theological contemplation and advice and volumes of personal ruminations. It is not enough to say that he stands as a major figure in the history of the Christian religion; he is, in many ways, one of the most influential figures in the history of European thought. His impact on American history reverberates to the present.
 The Jesuits arrived in New France in 1625 to help the more humble Recollets, but soon replaced them. In 1635, they established a school for teaching native boys and, in 1639, built the famous mission at Sainte-Marie in Huronia. In the St. Lawrence Valley, the Jesuits brought in engagés on three-year terms to provide agricultural support for their missions. The Ursuline nuns and other orders did the same. The Ursulines, in fact, added what might be seen as a liberal touch to Christian colonization when, in 1639, they arrived and established a school for young females, the first educational institution for women in North America. The order maintains a convent in Quebec City to this day.
 Like the Dutch and French, the English found ways to encourage settlement without straining the state’s coffers, and publicly supported but privately funded settlements characterized the new colonies in North America. As noted, the French Crown was slow to fund and then govern its colonies. In the 1660s, the haphazard early experiments along the St. Lawrence and in Acadia finally gave way to a policy of permanent royal administration. The Dutch approach to colonization was marked by private enterprise sanctioned by official policy and support. The early English model derived from the Crown’s nominal authority to grant licenses to groups of colonizers who would fund their own settlements. The charter system was born. In a way that parallels the French experience, the English Crown did not have a firm policy for the North American colonies until the 1660s, when a clearer system of trade and planning emerged. All the European empires in America evolved from experiment and ill-defined authority. The English were no different in that sense. But in important ways, their early settlements were fundamentally different, not only from those of their rivals but also from each other.
 While he is often depicted in popular caricature as a gluttonous hedonist, an egoist so obsessed with having a son and heir that he removed a succession of wives in the process, the legacy of Henry VIII is more substantial. In 1533, he made himself head of what would be the Church of England, known in America as the Anglican Church. By doing so, he effectively rejected the Catholic Church and Rome’s nominal spiritual and administrative authority. By 1536, the new state church began to seize the Catholic monasteries in England. Henry also saw to it that Sir Thomas More, the former chancellor of England, Renaissance scholar, and friend of Erasmus, was executed for refusing to recognize the rights of the Protestant succession in England. Henry’s radical actions were in part an angry attempt to control his own marital status, to annul or divorce as he saw fit, but there was a clear national interest. An independent church meant that England’s diplomatic policies could now be formed without concern for papal scrutiny.
 Henry’s Reformation left some of the ritual and protocols of Catholicism in place, as well as some of the administrative structure of archbishops, bishops, priests, and parishes, but the result was a dramatic act of independence from Rome. That break not only gradually separated English politics from those of France and Spain but also added an ecclesiastical difference to the national rivalries that followed. In England, the ecclesiastical pyramid now stopped at the Monarchy and not at Rome. As the century wore on, “Englishness” came to identify a culture and language linked to a state religion. By the time the English decided to settle in America, their laws, political organization, arts and letters, and a new church were on display.
 THE ROANOKE DISASTER, THE ARMADA, AND THE HAKLUYT IMPERATIVE Two important criteria for English colonization had been established. The first was a method, rather than a policy, of royal support and authorization for private exploration, settlement, and profit. This system in the first phase of English colonization in America obliged the charter recipient to serve the interests of the nation and maintain English religious and legal standards while enjoying free rein in local governance and development. A second and necessary component was a class or culture of either individuals or groups ready and eager to use the charter system. Grenville, Gilbert, Raleigh, and others of their ilk drove the colonization engine. Raleigh had picked up Gilbert’s patent, to try to succeed where the former had failed.
 Before all that, in the first half of the seventeenth century, the Stuarts struggled to adjust to the changing moods and values in English political life. James’s reign (1603–1625) was a mix of good sense in economics, stubbornness in politics, questionable personal behavior (his penchant for having young handsome male friends as companions), and failed foreign policies. While insisting on protecting the Church of England’s status, he managed to alienate both England’s Catholic minority and the more radical elements of English Protestantism. The so-called Guy Fawkes plot to blow up Parliament in 1605 led to a purge of Catholics. There was more trouble for the Stuarts stemming from Protestant reformers. Protestant separatists attacked the Church of England, and the more radical of those ended up in Holland. Within the Church itself, the seeds of reform created a movement, later known as “Puritanism,” that is, a movement to “purify” the Church of England and go even further with the Reformation. The movement had formed in the later years of Elizabeth’s reign but became more aggressive because of what the reformers saw as Stuart ambivalence. As noted, James himself was a controversial figure and aroused much comment by contemporaries regarding his many talents as well as his foibles. Henri IV of France is alleged to have called James the “wisest fool in Christendom,” a not inaccurate epithet.
 As soon as the Pilgrims had distanced themselves from the other migrants, they quickly tied their ecclesiastical ends to their civil and economic needs. The use of “first comers,” to distinguish the original group, was a sign of the symbolic importance of “founders.” Still, the experiment rested on the principle of voluntary uniformity. The otherwise plain manner of worship and the participatory roles in congregational organization were upheld by fasting days, obligatory social behavior, mandatory attendance at prayers and services, and a strict regimen of charity and morality. The Plymouth colony was a commune. Although it acknowledged a spiritual and church leadership and the notion of “visible saints,” there was a plan to operate the colony as an economic collective. That plan was modified early. Lots were assigned to individual families, and farms were started. Land was deeded, that is, fixed to personal ownership with the individual’s right to its disposal. Gender roles favored males, as in England, in legal and political matters.
 A future New England pattern was first seen in Plymouth, where a covenanted group, a genuine community, also allowed for individual property ownership. Its social and economic model rested on the principle of family farms for basic needs and as a means of engendering personal and social responsibility. The church was also the meeting house for civil issues. Taxes were voted on, land was distributed, and roads built by tax assessment, all done in open public forums. The needs of the corporate whole merged with personal responsibility and spiritual conformity. Because of its separatist ethic, it was a somewhat closed, insular society, and the somewhat arbitrary territorial boundaries of the “little commonwealth” were narrowly and poorly defined. The Pilgrims were dreamers and optimists seeking a harmonious sanctuary in America, but they were also practical in how they went about fulfilling those dreams.
 Pictured in tall hats and dark capes, the Pilgrims have been caricatured in American folklore as costumed characters who invented the thanksgiving and turkey tradition. They are so much more important in ways that mark off the diversity of the early English colonizers and their settlements. They stand in contrast, for a start, to the avaricious but befuddled early Virginians, by having a sensible mode of organization and a clear communal order. The “Godly enterprise” they started in America included the American Congregational Church that appeared throughout New England with the Puritan migration of the 1630S.
 PURITANS The term “puritan” with an upper or lower case “p” was used in the sixteenth century as an epithet for the “precisionists” who sought to expunge the residual Catholic customs from the Church of England. Unlike the Pilgrim Separatists, the Puritans were committed to change from within. Also, in England, the movement was not isolationist in the way the Separatists tended to be but increasingly attached itself to Parliament and its growing conflict with the Stuarts. Indeed, Parliament’s triumph in the English Civil War in the 1640S was achieved with the support of an intensely religious rank and file that had been around for decades. English Calvinism had also become a highly politicized revolutionary ideology that went beyond a program of church reform. Ironically, the most extreme English Puritans did not make their way to America but stayed and appeared as “Levellers” in the war-torn England of the 1640S. These radical egalitarians sought the dismantling of hereditary privilege based on property, the end of the nobility and monarchy, and universal manhood suffrage. Before that, however, after Charles I became king in 1625, some groups of dissenters chose voluntary exile to Massachusetts.
 The decade of the 1630s was also marked by disputes over church and theological matters. The General Court established a college in New Town (Cambridge) in 1636 to train ministers. It was named for a benefactor, John Harvard, shortly after his death in 1638. Over time, the school became an important institution of classical learning, but, in the short term, it served to parallel the colony’s own Christian mandate. It also responded to the Puritan priority of having a literate community. Although Winthrop and the magistrates sought to control the colony’s development, there was never any chance of a full-blown theocracy, in large part because of the charter’s political specifications. Moreover, the practical necessity of establishing a sustainable economy engaged the population in ways that moderated the magistrates’ oversight of everyday matters. Nevertheless, the colony’s leaders did push their versions of church orthodoxy and their presumed supervisory role in the spiritual lives of the people. But there were flaws in the façade of orthodoxy. Roger Williams (1603–1683) arrived in the colony as John Cotton’s friend. The men soon parted ways. As minister in the Salem church, Williams immediately questioned the civil authorities’ attempts to control the forms and content of worship and, in 1635, was summarily banished from the colony. Williams’s view of Congregationalism was open and liberal. To Winthrop and others, that approach constituted political defiance. As John Cotton became more committed to a fusion of political and church authority, his eyes were closed to any form of spiritual pluralism. Williams’s views went in the other direction. When he left Massachusetts he took his theories with him, purchased land from natives, and founded a settlement at Providence in what would become Rhode Island. A faction had broken away within a few years of settlement. Ironically, after dissenting from the Church of England’s orthodoxies, the New England Puritan leadership had discovered its own problems with dissent and the need to suppress it.
 The founding and settling of Plymouth and Massachusetts were models of order and competence in comparison to the mess at Jamestown. But each of the early colonies and non-chartered settlements experienced a sharp lesson in the realities of colonization. Whatever was intended or expected by the early groups was subject to internal strain, environmental correction, and unanticipated violence. The futures of these colonies was planned in England but ultimately determined in America. After two generations, there appeared in mainland North America several quite distinct English communities, all coping with their necessary adaptations to the realities of colonial enterprise.
 From the beginning, for all the high purpose and aggressive optimism of its founders, Massachusetts was very much an experiment in voluntary conformity. The first chink in its façade appeared when the leadership sought to enforce conformity. The voluntary departure of Roger Williams and the forced exile of Anne Hutchinson in the 1630s attest to that. If the Puritan collective could be threatened from within, it certainly wanted to avoid external taint. Sectarian discrimination lasted to the end of the seventeenth century. In 1651, three Baptists were hounded out of the colony, and a handful of Quakers were imprisoned and expelled in 1656. The General Court went so far as to impose the death penalty on any Quaker who reentered the colony after being expelled. As a result, two Quakers were hanged in 1659.
 After the Dyer hanging in 1660, the newly restored Stuarts stepped in and ordered the Massachusetts Bay Company to release any Quakers in custody. But the magistrates continued to exclude Quakers and others from residency and reapplied a corporal punishment law against nonconformists. As early as 1641, the company had yielded to criticism of its policies with its “Body of Liberties,” legislation that appeared to soften its penal codes and limit the sometimes arbitrary power of the magistrates. But, in 1646, John Winthrop and the colony’s leadership defied criticism of these exclusionary policies and announced that “allegiance binds us not to the laws of England any longer [if we do not] live in England.” This was not so much a denunciation of citizenship or a declaration of independence as it was an affirmation of the prerogatives of local authorities far away from English settings. Puritans sought to replicate the English village or, in Boston, the English market town and seaport, but those social and economic models were inevitably modified, by the system of land distribution and the particular functions of the Congregational Church. Moreover, Massachusetts early on claimed a measure of political autonomy under the terms of its charter.
 As for the Congregational Church, an agreement, the Cambridge Platform of 1648, was endorsed by the Connecticut settlements and by the Massachusetts General Court. It announced the supremacy of the Congregational model. It emphasized the local authority of each congregation and rejected the hierarchical models of the Church of England and the synod model of the Presbyterians. But, in its own way, it advocated a centralized format for the many individual congregations adhering to Puritan principles. The result was an odd mix of a formal established church, with colony-wide authority, alongside local congregations with certain administrative rights. Quakers, Baptists, and others were still excluded, however, and the Cambridge settlement suggested a standardized, mandatory, colony-wide ecclesiology while allowing local control over the choosing, housing, and paying of ministers.
 The area defined by Connecticut was settled by English opportunists along with Massachusetts people seeking to preempt the Dutch. Its first formal governor was Winthrop’s son, John the Younger. The liberal-minded Reverend Thomas Hooker influenced the settlements’ “Fundamental Orders” of 1639, which formalized a group of semiautonomous towns into a functioning colony with political institutions that resembled those of Massachusetts. Some 15 towns were established in Connecticut before 1660 in the vicinity of the unchartered New Haven colony of 1638. New Haven was especially rigid and limited the franchise to church members. After the royal charter of 1662 created a unified Connecticut, the colony absorbed New Haven in 1665.
 Andros’s future in America depended on the ability of his patron, James II, to maintain power in England. But James’s ego and his blatant Catholic leanings had sparked a national uprising that deposed him within four years of his accession. The single-minded James allowed the admission of Catholics to high office and formally tolerated Catholics and nonconformists in his “declarations of indulgence.” Then, to top it off, in 1688 he fathered a son, a potential Catholic heir to the throne. By the time James’s supporters had prosecuted several Church of England bishops for refusing his declarations of indulgence, a major confrontation was clearly in the offing. In late 1688, a group of seven influential political figures, including the Bishop of London, invited William of Orange to lead an army to depose James. William landed with an impressive Dutch army of some 15,000 troops. James was deserted by his senior people and took refuge in France. He returned in 1689 and raised an army in Ireland, but he was defeated by William’s forces at the Boyne, near Londonderry, and sent into permanent exile. The so-called Glorious Revolution was secured when William and his wife Mary, a Stuart, agreed to assume the English throne. Mary legitimized the succession, and William became William III. However, in a very important way, a revolution had taken place, as a coda to the events of the Civil War of the 1640s, and Parliament had secured an unshakable role in the constitution. In 1701, it passed a new Act of Succession, which ensured a Protestant monarchy and allowed Parliament a say in the succession.
 The monarchy was certainly capable of engaging popular support for its actions and policies. Elizabeth had offered a model for it, but the Stuarts lacked her flexibility in domestic affairs, her certainty in foreign affairs, and her innate “Englishness.” James left his son Charles I, with at least two expectations that were redundant: one, that he could curb Parliament’s rising assertiveness and two, that he could stem the growing radicalism of some reformminded religious groups. By supporting the Church of England’s attacks on separatists and reformers, who were mostly Puritans, he ran afoul of many House of Commons members. Charles had substantial support at the highest levels as head of the Church of England, the nation’s most powerful institution outside Parliament. Because the bishops who sat in the House of Lords had the ear of the king, as did most of the privileged landed classes, support for Charles’s version of the royal prerogative was acceptable to an important stratum of English society. But, in Parliament, a serious division had developed in English politics that made Puritan reform of the church, for example, a form of political opposition.
 Cromwell left another imperial legacy. In the 1650s, he began to move Scottish settlers en masse into the north of Ireland as part of his strategy to convert the Irish to Protestantism and to displace as many Catholics as possible with an influx of mostly Presbyterian Scottish settlers. This has affected Ireland to the present, and the six counties of Ulster retain deep sectarian divisions. The northern Irish impact on America began in the early eighteenth century as thousands of the successors of those settlers, the so-called Scotch Irish, made their way to the American frontier, in particular, to Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the Carolinas.
 Massachusetts and Pennsylvania were each established as Christian “commonwealths.” But they were established several decades and several degrees of purpose apart. By 1700, Winthrop’s model colony had undergone some charter and ideological modification but remained Congregationalist and ethnically English. What Penn left behind was a political system that reflected the colony’s pluralistic religious and ethnic population. By the middle of the eighteenth century, Pennsylvania was home to the most socially and ethnically diverse community in the western world, with Quakers by then in the minority. German and Scotch-Irish immigrants outnumbered the English. Philadelphia became one of the most important ports in the empire, and the rural population of Pennsylvania was perhaps the most prosperous per capita in America. In contrast to the homogeneous populations of the New England colonies or the functionally elitist slave societies of the Chesapeake, the middle colonies after the Restoration introduced lively, polyglot variants to the North American settlements, which were by then expanding south of the Chesapeake.
 The plan for Carolina was a complicated mix of open political and religious freedoms that included a superstructure, which hoped to replicate the titled and landed hierarchies of England. The proprietors would each have a “seigniory” of 12,000 acres in each of the counties as they were formed. Below this ruling group would be “landgraves” with grants of up to 48,000 acres in total. Then there was a descending strata of landholders that included caciques, a term borrowed from the Spanish word for native chief, and below that manor lords and descending categories of landholding down to “freeholders” with 50 acres and voting rights. Although sectarian Christian worship was tolerated, the Church of England was “established” as the official tax-supported church. There was something dreamlike in the assumptions of those proprietors. America was not the place to replicate the English aristocracy.
 Cromwell had dissolved the Lords in 1649 with the view of abolishing it. It was restored in 1660. Following the Restoration and despite Parliament’s victory over the royalist excesses of Charles II, both houses were divided over policy, interest, and influence. The divisions were sometimes ideological but usually came down to contests over the distribution of patronage, of government contracts, and of “places” (offices). As the structure of government afforded the Monarch the authority to administer the law, parliamentary maneuverings rotated around the king and his successors after the Restoration. The divisions settled into two main groups, known by the originally derisive “Tories” and “Whigs.” The former term derived from an Irish word for bandit, and “Whig” from an English Civil War reference to Presbyterian rebels in Scotland. The “parties” had begun to appear before the Glorious Revolution, originally as “Court” (Tory) and “Country” (Whig). The Court party presumed to represent landed interests in the royal orbit of power and preference, while the Country party opposed Stuart policies and was strongly anti-Catholic. The terms were applied in interesting ways to the patriot and loyalist factions and their objectives during the American Revolution, with patriots (“rebels”) being referred to as “Whigs” and the loyalists as “Tories.” Between 1679 and 1681, the Whigs had introduced “exclusion bills” to prevent James II (then the Duke of York) from gaining the throne. As early as 1673, Parliament, in a generally nonpartisan mood, had pushed through a Test Act to exclude non-Anglicans by “testing” the faith and affiliations of potential officeholders. In the end, those Whigs were ultimately responsible for the accession of William and Mary and then Anne and then the Hanoverian Georges. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Tories, as an opposition party, attacked government corruption and national debt and fought with the Whigs over foreign and domestic issues. A measure of the instability in Parliament is best illustrated by noting that, between 1689 and 1715, twelve parliamentary elections were held in England (Britain after 1707) or roughly one every two years. These were expensive and rancorous and illustrate confused and shifting alliances and groupings inside and outside Parliament. The number of elections in that 26-year period contrasts with the thirteen elections that were held in the remainder of the eighteenth century. To put that in perspective, the number of general elections in the 1689 to 1715 period is greater than in any other comparable time period in British history.
 Absolutism prevailed in France, Spain, Prussia, Austria, and Russia, but it had failed to take root with the Stuarts in Britain. Britain was different. The Church of England was the state church, to be sure, and test and conformity acts continued to exclude all but conformists from important civil positions. However, Methodism, a minor but lively movement, offered alternatives, especially to the lower classes. Presbyterianism was a brake on Anglican hegemony in Scotland and Northern Ireland and, in Scotland, enjoyed the status of a national church. Ireland was nominally part of the British state but is best seen as a colony where English and Protestant landholders ruled over a persistent and aggrieved Catholic majority.
 There was a conscious attempt early on to follow established English patterns of land use, which saw private homesteads supplemented by commons. Local authority and governance borrowed heavily from older Tudor English statutes regarding the poor, the criminal, and the transient. The practice of “warning out” impoverished transients or unsavory, unsponsored, or unknown migrants reflected English vagrancy laws and reinforced the towns’ somewhat insular purposes. The most distinctive role of the towns was to serve as the representative units in the New England colonial assemblies. The elected members of the legislative assemblies of Connecticut, Massachusetts (including Maine), New Hampshire, and Rhode Island represented the towns that sent them. Towns, as communal entities rather than as groups of individuals, parties, or ethnic or religious delegates were the agents of representative government. New England’s politics evolved into a unique system that contrasted both with traditional, preferential British parliamentary representation and with the economic, ethnic, or proprietary priorities of West Indian and some other British North American jurisdictions. Counties were created in New England but had no political purpose apart from the administration of civil and criminal courts. In all of preindustrial America, the face of authority first presented itself at the local level, and, in New England, local meant town.
 New England’s Regional Culture and Society The hum of Boston commerce, the rural New England town as social organ, the legislative process, the agrarian nuclear family, and a common history defined a regional culture. The ethnic face of New England remained predominantly English, but what had been modified was the Congregational Church’s hegemony. The orthodox Calvinism of the first half of the seventeenth century had been softened. After the first generation of ministers and theologians, there was much lamenting of the weakening of the holy mission of the founders, the so-called declension thesis that focused on the decline of spiritual integrity. The “jeremiad” and the cautionary sermons of failure and defeat gave way in the eighteenth century to sermons that concentrated on self-help and personal responsibility. Preachers railed against idleness and social disorder as much as they attempted to retain, revive, or redesign Calvinist doctrine. Socially, even in the midst of visible demographic change, New Englanders were busy expanding north or west in search of fertile and accessible land. New towns continued to be created on the fringes of settlement and by subdividing existing towns. But there was also significant multigenerational residential persistence. Although the New England colonies attracted fewer immigrants than the rest of mainland British America, the high levels of natural increase, a healthy population, and longevity kept the population growing at an impressive rate. As noted, there were periodic outbreaks of diphtheria, influenza, and the apparently contagious “throat distemper” along with the dreaded smallpox, but, by any contemporary measure, anywhere in the world, New England was a healthy place.
 The American promise, the land of opportunity for the masses, appeared to be the frontier that ran from western Pennsylvania south to Georgia. There was no comparable settlement in New York’s western and northern reaches. In New England, by contrast, the Maine and New Hampshire frontiers grew, but they did so by replicating, for the most part, the institutional and cultural models of older, denser, settled southern New England. From the middle of the eighteenth century, the great surge of population into the backcountry created a rare social and political environment on the frontier.
 Thereafter, Morris served as governor of New Jersey, and his role in politics was somewhat reversed. He squabbled constantly with the New Jersey Assembly. As for James Delancey, he returned to provincial politics and, until his death in 1760, was a committed supporter of assembly rights. His son, James Delancey, Jr. was also active in New York politics until the imperial crisis, when his loyalist sympathies obliged him to move to England in 1774. While these political convolutions had popular objectives, it is worth noting that Morris and Delancey, the principal players in this case, were each members of New York’s landed elites. Popular politics in British America were still guided by men with means.
 Those reforms, seen by colonists as impositions, drew the colonies together politically and, at the same time, made each aware of its unique social and cultural qualities. Virginia, South Carolina, Maryland, or any colonial jurisdiction was “home” to its residents and not some historian’s “region.” Southerners, like northerners, were existentially bound to their respective localities because of the immediacy of day-to-day affairs in rural environments where communication and travel were slow and difficult. There was also an attachment to the colony because it represented political authority at the local level. Finally, the one common bond was with the British Empire as the overarching constitutional and economic guarantor and, of course, the vessel of colonists’ cultural heritage.
 Spiritually, the slave could trust in the hereafter, either as an animist or Christian, and, as the eighteenth century wore on, Christianity became increasingly important. The earlier exclusion of blacks from a Christian connection gradually gave way to white acceptance of Christianity for black people as irresistible. It became a way of accommodating the slave’s spiritual needs while affording an outlet for slave emotion—a control mechanism in the minds of many planters. Although blacks could be Christians, they remained outside the white church organizations and congregations. The Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1740s hinted at a measure of integration, but, in the end, black Christianity was left to develop its own segregated but vital devotion, worship, and outlook.
 Charles Woodmason’s mission was undertaken in the late 1760s, after the Seven Years’ War, when colonial protests over Parliament’s reforms were growing. He was concerned with the weakness of the Anglican establishment in the aftermath of both the Great Awakening and the revivals that had recently swept through the colonies, but he was also a critical observer of the rising political tensions in the 1760s. He often berated the South Carolina Assembly’s anti-imperial behavior as hypocritical because it was ignoring its own people in the backcountry. Woodmason could be tender, sarcastic, astute, and hostile by turn, especially as he railed against the Charleston elite. He had a flair for the ironic and was a decent satirist. He made keen notes on geography and society wherever he went. In the end, however, the difficulties he encountered defeated him. He consoled himself in the tone of the martyr, as follows: Thus You have a Journal of two Years—In which [I] have rode near Six thousand Miles, almost on one Horse. Wore my Self to a Skeleton and endured all the Extremities of Hunger, Thirst, Cold, and Heat. Have baptized near 1200 Children—Given 200 or more Discourses—Rais’d almost 30 Congregations—Set on foot the building of sundry Chapels Distributed Books, Medicines, Garden Seed, Turnip, Clover, Timothy Burnet, and other Grass Seeds—with Fish Hooks—Small working Tools and variety of Implements to set the Poor at Work, and promote Industry to the amount of at least One hundred Pounds Sterling: Roads are making—Boats building—Bridges framing, and other useful Works begun thro’ my Means, as will not only be of public Utility, but make the Country side wear a New face, and the People become New Creatures. And I will venture to attest that these small, weak Endeavours of mine to serve the Community, has (or will) be of more Service to the Colony, than ever Mr. Whitfield’s [sic] Orphan House was, or will be. (259) As he recounts his odyssey, the crusading Woodmason puts a positive face on an experience that at times thoroughly depressed him. The reference at the end is to George Whitefield (1714–1770), who, twenty years earlier, spearheaded a faith-based, cross-sectarian, born-again revival in the south. Here was the bane of Woodmason’s experience in the backcountry and later in his sojourn in tidewater Maryland: the Great Awakening had revealed some insecurity not only in the Anglican Church but also in conservative worship and church orders everywhere. Woodmason had discovered a very important development in 1760s America, a booming multiethnic medley of peoples and nonconforming sects in the backcountry and their convergence into a culture unlike that in any other part of British America.
 The stirring phrases that precede the free speech clause of the Bill of Rights of 1791 reflected established colonial practices. Eighteenth century Americans understood their “religion” to mean the Christian religion and if, over time, “free exercise” would eventually include the entire range of the world’s religions, in 1791 “free exercise” was understood to apply to Christian sects. Colonial America was too vast, its peoples too spatially and socially mobile, its growth too rapid, its doors too open, and its jurisdictions too diverse to allow any Christian variant to dominate the whole completely. By the middle of the eighteenth century, an assortment of sects, subsets, new strains, and long-established ecclesiastical organizations thrived in America. The Reformation had sent Protestantism along paths of adaptation, experimentation, and change, and while the Church of Rome, the “universal” or Catholic Church, held fast to a global standard of its doctrines, Protestant sects grew in complexity. As the latter became increasingly vernacular over time, that is, Dutch for the Dutch, English for the English, and so on, the Catholic Church retained one very important organizational feature, the global authority of the pope and the hierarchy that assumed to manage the church’s affairs throughout the world. There were various orders within the Church of Rome, the Franciscans and Jesuits, for example, but Catholicism’s practices, authority, and the style of its missions were less flexible than those of the Protestant denominations. It was not until the nineteenth century that the exclusive use of Latin in the mass was eased. In 1750, there were only 30 Catholic churches in only five colonies out of nearly 1500 churches throughout the thirteen British mainland colonies. Those 1,500 churches, or congregations, represented several major Protestant denominations and some smaller sects or subdivisions: Anglican (Church of England) After the Congregationalist Church of New England, this was the second largest church organization in the colonies in 1750, although both the Baptists and Presbyterians surpassed it in size by the 1780s. After its sixteenth century Tudor separation from Rome, the Church of England retained some of the cosmetics and functions of the Catholic Church, such as structured and ritualized worship, elaborate church furnishings, and a hierarchical organization. The Monarch was the head of the church and archbishops, bishops, and clergy at the parish-congregational level ran its affairs. So-called high church Anglicanism was too conservative for many and gave rise to a reform movement in England that attempted to “purify” the church in the Elizabethan era. The term “Puritan” was coined to describe these reformers, and, in the seventeenth century, Puritans became part of the English diaspora that went to America. They founded Massachusetts and shaped the Christian face of New England in a way that stunted the Church of England’s prospects to dominate colonial America, if, in fact, that had been possible. From the founding of Jamestown in 1607, Anglican services in America adopted a form of worship that was plain and closer to the Puritan than the “high church” style. There was an immediate modification in church governance so that the vestry was controlled by lay people who controlled the clergy in the absence of a strong bishopric. The vestry distributed charity or poor relief, which was a responsibility of the civil authorities, the town meeting, in New England. In nearly all jurisdictions, there was never enough clergy for the church’s plans. Woodmason’s South Carolina backcountry was not so much the exception as an extreme version of what the church faced everywhere: sectarian competition and weak or even absent administration. This held true even where the Anglican Church was made the established church, as it was in Virginia, part of New York, Maryland, the Carolinas, and Georgia. British missionary programs for white colonists, the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge (1698) and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts 1701) helped in the modest spread of the Anglican Church in America, especially in the Chesapeake and the lower south. In important and ironic ways, however, the Church of England’s relations with its colonial outposts did as much to foster nonconformity as to advance the interests of the church. When the Anglican Church in America dropped its affiliation with the Church of England after independence in 1784, it became the Episcopalian Church, a wholly American organization. In Canada, the Anglican Church remains strong in part because loyalists took it there after the Revolution and because the Church of England promoted itself in the creation of later Canadian colonies.
 Congregational Church (Puritan) This was the product of the Puritan mission to reform the Church of England in America. In the process, it created what became a powerful new ecclesiastical authority in New England. The initial Calvinist thrust of the Puritan crusade left its mark on the way spiritual and social communalism survived in colonial and revolutionary New England. Congregationalism was partly a top-down organization; the Cambridge Platform of 1648 in Massachusetts gave elders the power to limit who could speak in church, and the 1708 Saybrook Platform in Connecticut acknowledged the principle of “consociation” or the forming of standing councils to ordain ministers and discipline members. However, the Congregational establishment coexisted with local prerogatives, and, although worship, ethical values, and theological discipline were somewhat standardized, local congregations retained considerable control over their day-to-day affairs. A “Puritan ethic” of communalism and spiritual conformity survived well into the eighteenth century, even as other denominations arrived and settled. What changed in Puritan New England was the erosion of the predestination doctrine and its replacement with the prospect of salvation for all. The image of the stern, repressive, and repressed Puritan New Englander should really be replaced by the reality of a sober-minded, neighborly, community-oriented individual surrounded by a culture that took its heaven and hell alternatives seriously and that retained the greatest of the Congregationalist legacies, the town as the fount of civil and social order. But Puritan Congregationalism was fixed in its region. There were more Congregational churches (that is, a greater number of congregations) in British America in 1750 than there were churches of any other denomination, but 98 per cent of them were in New England.
 Presbyterian Church Presbyterianism was born in the Scottish Reformation of the sixteenth century and molded in the fiery Calvinism of John Knox and his followers, the founders of the powerful Church of Scotland (the “Kirk”). Presbyterian congregations grew in Northern Ireland as Scots occupied the Ulster counties in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Presbyterian doctrines and manners were close to those of Puritan Calvinism in practice and sentiment, but the “synod” as an assembly of congregations and “presbyters,” that is elders and lay officials, differed in important ways from the Puritan models. In Connecticut, for example, Congregationalists tended to become affiliated with the Presbyterian Church because of a preference for the synod. The steady influx of Scots and Scotch-Irish settlers into the middle and southern parts of the mainland colonies boosted the church’s numbers in America and greatly expanded its reach. In the eighteenth century, it became an important cultural and social force in the middle colonies and the backcountry and with the Baptist Church passed the Anglican Church in numbers of churches and adherents. The association of Presbyterianism with ethnic and cultural nonconformity is a bit ironic given its favored style of worship and sermonizing, which was often stern. The authoritarian structure of the synod model tended to make the church hierarchical. The Great Awakening’s impact on America hit the Presbyterian Church as it did others by challenging its centralizing and formal doctrines, but Presbyterianism survived as a formidable social and political force in Christian America.
 Baptist This popular product of the Reformation was considered radical as much for its flexibility as for its theology. Its individual congregations applied methods and models of worship and devotion that ranged from predestination to free will. The scriptures were taken literally, and the baptism of adults seeking redemption was a hallmark of its ethos. The great success of the Baptist movement derived from the autonomy enjoyed by its many individual congregations. From two small congregations in seventeenth century Rhode Island to the explosive rise in the sect’s popularity in the eighteenth century, the Baptist Church was the fastest growing denomination in the colonies. By the 1780s, it had passed the Anglican Church in number of congregations and was third in numbers of adherents behind Congregationalists and Presbyterians. Its adaptability, its apparent accessibility, and a basic egalitarian premise made the Baptist movement appealing and dynamic. It was open to novelty and innovation and was immensely popular in the backcountry. For all its popular appeal, the Baptist network respected the need to ordain and support educated ministers. Baptists received a charter for Rhode Island College (later Brown University) in 1764. In many ways, the Baptists became the quintessential revivalist movement during the Great Awakening of the 1730–1750 period. They encouraged itinerancy and benefited from the “born again” credo that marked the revivals.
 Dutch Reformed The Dutch Reformed Church is one of the oldest Protestant Church organizations in America. There were nine active congregations in New Netherland when the English took it in 1664, and they were tolerated by the Anglican establishment. The Dutch Reformed Church flourished in the middle colonies under the auspices of the Amsterdam Classis, the clerical supervisors of overseas congregations. There were over 100 functioning congregations on the eve of the Revolution. As in other denominations, however, there was internal fissure in the Dutch Reform Church in the eighteenth century. On one hand were traditionalist congregations that maintained ceremonial services and worship with a great deal of emphasis on theology. This was in some contrast to other Dutch Reform congregations, largely rural and often remote, that emphasized spontaneity and open expressions of faith rather than mandatory adherence to doctrine.
 German Reformed For most of the eighteenth century, the German Reformed Church operated under the ecclesiastical aegis of the Amsterdam Classis. This arrangement was more a convenience than a demonstration of affinity with the Dutch. The two groups were separated by the locations of their ethnic-based settlements. The German variant appeared first in New York in the first decade of the century, and, as the numbers of German immigrants rose, the church grew to embrace nearly 200 congregations by the 1770s. Perhaps a third of all Rhineland immigrants belonged to the German Reformed Church.
 Quakers (Society of Friends) In its earliest manifestations in England, the Society of Friends was among the most radical of sects. Its founder, George Fox (1624–1691) is quoted as saying, “When the Lord sent me forth into the world he forbade me to put off my hat to any, high or low.” Its rise in the seventeenth century to a vibrant global movement is a measure of the tenacity and deep spirituality of its membership and its martyrs, who were persecuted in the British Isles and New England. The movement’s founder, George Fox, was hounded, ridiculed, and jailed for his radicalism. Quakers threatened the order and authority of the established Church of England and its Puritan offshoot in New England because of their claim to an “inner light,” an individual communion with God. This assertion defied the usual sermonizing of most Protestant services and the liturgical thrust of Anglican public worship. The very term Quaker refers to the appearance of “quaking” or trembling that accompanied the believers’ experience of the “inner light.” In place of conventional church settings, Quakers held “meetings” to discuss spiritual matters in the absence of a trained or ordained ministry. Their focus on family and business led to tight communities and successful economic enterprise, in trade, land development, farming, and merchandizing.
 Other important Protestant sects thrived in the fluid Christian atmosphere of the eighteenth century. Mennonites, for example, led by Daniel Francis Pastorius took their name from an early Protestant, Menno Simons, and settled in Pennsylvania within two years of Penn’s charter. As noted, they were perhaps the earliest antislavery activists and in a 1688 resolution likened slavery to theft. They formed cooperative settlements and argued for strict church-state separation while blending Calvinist predestination theory with Quaker pacifism in their theology. The more conservative branch of Mennonites, the Amish, strove for simplicity and communalism in their tightly knit settlements. Minor German Baptist sects, Dunkards and the Ephrata Society, set up in the 1720s and 1730s in the middle colonies along with another exotic German offshoot, the Schwenkfelders, in Pennsylvania. Shakers were relatively late arrivals, showing up in 1774 during the imperial crisis. The eponymous Dunkers were pacifists who took their name from their immersion practices. The quiet, reflective Ephrata Society members promoted chastity. Methodists were an invigorating Anglican faction with an enthusiastic and informal approach to worship. They supported an itinerant ministry.
 It is a commonplace to see seventeenth century Puritans as dissenters seeking freedom of religious expression. That view is only partly correct and only so in its English variant. Once established, the Puritans of Massachusetts applied a rigorous exclusivity. The term given to the Puritan Church establishment, “Congregational,” should not be confused with the lower case word “congregation,” which simply meant the regular members and attendees of any denomination. Groups such as Quakers and Baptists persistently challenged the Congregational domain, and internal differences were evident throughout. However, as Anne Hutchinson and Roger Williams demonstrated early on, tensions inside the Calvinist communities eventually gave way to official moderation. Moreover, the Massachusetts Royal Charter of 1691 opened the door to other denominations to reflect the modest but legal levels of religious tolerance that prevailed in England in the wake of the Glorious Revolution. In 1650, all but two of the 59 churches in all of New England had been Congregational. By 1750, there were 7 Anglican congregations in Rhode Island and Baptist churches outnumbered Congregational churches by 30 to 12. Even in Massachusetts by mid century, the number of Presbyterian, Anglican, Baptist, and other congregations comprised about 20 per cent of all churches. While advocates of the holy commonwealth such as Cotton Mather had kept alive the corporate and theological values of earlier Puritanism, it was clear that even the most closed of Christian communities was now open to other denominations.
 In Virginia, the Anglican Church maintained official status from the start, but there was a persistent lack of parsons to fill the needs of the expanding population. The same thing happened in the Carolinas and Georgia later on in the century and all the way to the Revolution. In the 1630s, the creation of a Catholic refuge was part of the rationale for founding Maryland, but the need to fill the colony with settlers meant that almost immediately Anglicans and even Puritans moved in. The kaleidoscopic ethnic and sectarian future of the middle colonies was evident in the way those colonies came about. English New York was intended to have an official Anglican Church superimposed on existing Dutch sects, but, in a short time, a plethora of Protestant strains called New York home. Quaker proprietors in West Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware were intended to favor Quakers, but hardly had the doors opened when Europe’s army of Christian sects moved in and Quaker authority receded. In 1687, long before Charles Woodmason gasped at the jumble of sects in the Carolina backcountry, Catholic Governor of New York Thomas Dongan reported a bewildering congeries of “opinions” that included Anglicans, Dutch Lutherans, Dutch Reformed, French Calvinists, Roman Catholics, “Singing” and “Ranting” Quakers, Sabbatarians, Anti-Sabbatarians, Anabaptists, Independents, and Jews.
 In most places, in the early decades of the eighteenth century church, attendance was strong, but membership in some denominations was eroding. One estimate shows that fewer than 70 per cent of colonists were affiliated, a figure that varied with each region, being higher in New England and the tidewater and among certain sects, Quakers and Congregationalists, for example. In any case, the civil authority of the church hierarchies was weak. There were no bishops in Anglican America, and the various Church of England missionary programs, the Presbyterian Synod (a form of central authority), Congregational “consociations,” or any formal institutional organization found it difficult to enforce common standards, even though they maintained a thread of coherence through their far-flung congregations. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century, Philadelphia was a hub of sectarian variation and organizations, for example, the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting (Quaker), the Synod of Philadelphia (Presbyterian), the Philadelphia Baptist Association, and, in the 1740s, the German Reformed (Calvinist) and the Lutheran Ministerium of Philadelphia. Throughout the colonies, local clergy exercised varying degrees of political and social influence, although the lay vestries in the south usually outranked Anglican ministers in local affairs.

 The Awakening needs first to be seen in the light of sectarian pluralism. Also, within the conventional groupings of Anglicans, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Baptists, and so on, there were breakaway minorities, degrees of intensity, and outright failure to keep congregations in step with formal doctrines. The more open approach to Christian life practiced by Baptists in most cases did not exclude firm Calvinists from being Baptists. In other words, single definitions of denominational attitudes and practices do not work. Presbyterians in Pennsylvania shared much with Presbyterians in South Carolina’s backcountry, but it would be folly to see a backcountry congregation responding in the same way as Pennsylvanians to the Synod’s credos. A second and important root of the American Awakening is the European influence, first in the way immigrants brought new and occasionally flexible ideas and practices with them and second in the fact that revivals had, by the first quarter of the century, begun to influence most Protestant communities. George Whitefield, the name most associated with the Awakening in America, the very model of active, faith-based revivalism, was English. Not only that but he had been raised in the Anglican community and influenced by John Wesley’s Methodist alternative, a movement in England that was a clear prelude to transatlantic revivalism. Whitefield made twice as many “tours” of Scotland as he did of America.
 Theodorus Frelinghuysen (1691—ca.1747) was a German-born Dutch Reformed pastor who came to America in his late twenties and was a seminal figure in the Awakening in the middle colonies. Another strain of revivalism came from William Tennent (1673–1764), a Scotch-Irish Presbyterian, and his sons Gilbert (1703–1764) and William (1705–1777). These and other preachers remind us that the Awakening was driven by the tenacity and innovations of dozens of itinerants who either preceded Whitefield’s appearance in America or followed in his path. Not only itinerants but some conventional clergy incorporated a “born again” message into their sermons and lessons. The Awakening benefited from the advance publicity its major speakers received, especially in Whitefield’s case. The appearance of several thousand people to hear an open-air sermon by Whitefield was a polished, organized affair.
 The contemporary explanation for the duration and reach of the Awakening was that even the most active of Christian organizations and the healthiest congregations needed to find ways to rejuvenate their spiritual lives. In New England, for example, the standard sermons from many Congregationalist pulpits were increasingly sociological. Lectures on behavior became commonplace. It was not simply that American Protestantism had lost its fervor but rather that it was stuck in routines. The Awakening is important because it applied a fresh activism to congregational culture and is best understood as a reform movement rather than a revolutionary one. It was encouraged by zealots and fundamentalists whose egalitarian and often informal approaches shook the complacency of many churches. It is important to note that, for all its appearance of promoting alternative ways of worship, the Awakening did not destroy the existing church organizations. What it did was modify the authority of many clergymen and encourage more emotion and enthusiasm in much of the population. It could also be divisive and split some congregations between conservatives and liberals. The itinerants were capable of dividing the massive Congregationalist and Presbyterian organizations into “New Light” and “Old Light” (conservative) factions. Perhaps the best way to consider the Awakening is to note its origins within the churches themselves. In America, the early signs of revivalism occurred at the local level.
 By the 1720s, there were signs of dissatisfaction with the conservatism and pedantry of some clergy in all denominations. In the more doctrinal organizations and congregations, the guilt of “original sin” was being challenged by the perceived ability of individuals to wash away the sin with an enthusiastic faith—one emphasizing the heart over the mind and the “born again” principle. The stage was set, in fact, for an eruption of evangelicalism. For example, the Presbyterian Church authority was seen by some to be the source of dull and somber sermonizing; Dutch and German Reformed authorities resisted giving services in English, and the absence of American-trained Presbyterian ministers was resented by many in the Presbyterian orbit. A revival in New Jersey in the late 1720s, known as the “refreshings,” was an early sign. It involved the collaboration of Theodorus Frelinghuysen of the Dutch Reformed Church and William Tennent, the Presbyterian. These two immigrant ministers promoted unusual policies. Each preached messages of spiritual rejuvenation, and they went so far as to exchange pulpits. They kept this up for years and together inspired similar revivals in the neighborhood.
 Gilbert Tennent, the eldest of William’s four sons, became the most prominent revivalist in the middle colonies. He was intense, vibrant, and disruptive, creating a serious breach in the Presbyterian Church that lasted for many years. Long before the arrival of Whitefield, the Tennents aroused a great deal of enthusiasm for reform and itinerancy. Preachers moving through settled areas on horseback—swaying audiences with new and animated versions of redemption and conversion—worried conservative Presbyterians, Baptists, and others. Gilbert Tennent was especially disruptive to the Presbyterian Synod with his loud, fearsome, and animated sermons. He was, like most Awakeners, a human dynamo, and he gave the renowned Whitefield some pointers on sermonizing. Although the movement fueled by the Tennents eventually eased and its proponents became more moderate, the Awakening left a permanent impression on religion and culture in the middle colonies. The Tennent-inspired “Log College” of 1735 was established to train revivalist ministers and was the seed for the later College of New Jersey (ultimately Princeton University). There is also no doubt that Gilbert Tennent’s seminal tract The Danger of an Unconverted Ministry (1740) put the matter of revivalism on a long-term logical plane. His premise was straightforward: what hope was there for the restoration of faith in common people if the preachers themselves had not been “born again”?
 Of the prominent Awakeners who turned America on its head for a few years in the 1730s and 1740s the most important was George Whitefield. He was the touchstone for all the revivalists. His collaboration or simple association was as important to the Tennents as it was to Jonathan Edwards and, at the other end of the spectrum, to the likes of James Davenport. The great English-born revivalist-itinerant was born an Anglican, raised in a tavern, graduated from Oxford, and, by the mid-1730s, was an accomplished orator who could deliver spellbinding sermons. He knew Charles and John Wesley and picked up on the evangelizing spirit of those two innovative Anglican priests. He followed them to Georgia in 1738 and began his American career there. Whitefield and John Wesley shared similar ideas on faith conversion and itinerancy, but Wesley had no success in the primitive precincts of Oglethorpe’s Georgia, so he went back to England and began to preach in the open air. He traveled extensively for a half century in an English version of the Awakening, covering 250,000 miles and delivering as many as 40,000 sermons, a measure of his energy and vision. Wesley was hounded, insulted, and had his life threatened, but he left behind a great legacy, Methodism, an originally pejorative term for his small group of Anglican followers, which grew in importance over time in England and America. His brother Charles also has a legacy that can be found in hymnbooks everywhere in the Protestant world; he wrote over 6,000 devotional songs.
 By then the apogee of the Great Awakening had passed, and Whitefield had been contained by the New England clergy that had offered him their pulpits a generation earlier. If the Old Lights, in modified form, had recovered somewhat in New England and the middle colonies, the Awakening continued to flourish in parts of the lower south, especially in the backcountry. If we think of the Great Awakening as the first great trans-colonial social event, we should note that it also revealed regional differences that were there to begin with and persisted beyond the era. Its causes and effects were as varied as the peoples whom it touched. The common thread of “faith over reason” meant something to Baptists in South Carolina but something else to Congregationalists in Massachusetts. By the 1750s, in the north, there was a counter-revival that attacked the angry God of the itinerants. A more beneficent God, the God that looked kindly upon all men and allowed for redemption of the soul for good works and morality, without the need for emotional displays of faith, had crept into sermons. In 1750, Charles Chauncy of Boston’s First Church wrote a manuscript that he called “pudding” to keep its explosive contents secret. Between 1782 and 1785, he published some of these musings, and his The Benevolence of the Deity 1784) can be read as a counter to the revivalists’ “wrathful” God. In other words, there were other ways to redemption, but, by the 1750s, the Awakening had made its mark. It had thrust Christian commitment back into the mainstream of colonial life. It had also left behind a set of colleges.
 Before the Awakening only three had been established in the mainland colonies: Harvard (Congregational) in 1636 in Massachusetts, the College of William and Mary (Anglican) in 1693 in Virginia, and Yale (Congregational) in 1701 in Connecticut. These were joined by The College of New Jersey (Presbyterian) in 1746, which later evolved into Princeton University; Rhode Island College (Baptist) in 1764, which would become Brown University; Queen’s College in New Jersey (Dutch Reformed) in 1766, which would become Rutgers; and Dartmouth College in New Hampshire (Congregational) in 1769. The designations were real and intended to promote the cause of the founding denominations and produce well-educated clergy. These schools were not as focused on theological training as their origins might suggest, but offered mostly liberal arts instruction. Benjamin Franklin’s Philadelphia Academy, which opened in 1751, was nonsectarian and later became the basis of the University of Pennsylvania. King’s College in New York City was established in 1754 under an Anglican administration but was effectively nonsectarian. It closed during the War for Independence and reopened in the 1780s as Columbia College. Public universities were slower to develop and appeared later, during and after the Revolution.

 In the fi rst place, the Church of England was internally divided among  three primary camps. The High Church or Anglo-Catholic position was cham- pioned by the Tractarian Movement of the 1830s–1840s and led by Oxford  divines like Edward Pusey, John Keble, and John Henry Newman. It sought to  reestablish the apostolic and therefore institutional authority of the Church in  relationship to its Catholic origins. The Low Church movement began as part  of the Evangelical Revival of the eighteenth century and was in the nineteenth  century one attempt to compete with the growing popularity of Nonconform- ist evangelical and Biblical fundamentalist Christianity. Representative fi gures  were the Seventh Earl of Shaftesbury, Bishop J. C. Ryle, and Bishop C. J.  Ellicott. The Broad Church or Latitudinarian position was typifi ed by A. P.  Stanley, Benjamin Jowett, and John William Colenso, Bishop of Natal, and  by the publication in 1860 of Essays and Reviews. The authors of those pieces  strove for national unity among the diversity of Anglican positions, but in- stead they alienated evangelicals and Anglo-Catholics alike by advocating “for  a thoroughly historical and critical approach to the Bible, for recognition of  the moral and spiritual worth of religious traditions outside the Bible, and for  acceptance of the fi ndings of science concerning both the age of the earth and  its geological history” (Parsons, “Reform” 41).
 At the same time, the Church was under assault, both theologically and  politically, from other denominations. By the 1830s there was intense pressure  from Whig or Liberal parliamentarians in the direction of disestablishment of  the Church’s privileged status as the state-sanctioned institution it had been for most of three hundred years. The Test and Corporation Act of 1828 granted  Nonconformists the right to hold public offi ce, and Catholics were extended  similar rights by the Roman Catholic Relief (or Catholic Emancipation) Act of  1829 (though with much less immediate impact, given that Catholics consti- tuted only about 4 percent of the church-going population in England at mid  century). These acts were precursors of religious legislation in subsequent de- cades that gradually reduced the legal exclusivity of the Church and extended  greater political equality not only to Nonconformists, but to Catholics and  Jews; indeed, the century charts the step-by-step, de facto disestablishment of  Anglicanism.
 A major turning point in this process came with the 1851 Census of Re- ligious Worship.9 It revealed two ground-shaking facts. First, in a nation that  considered itself unequivocally and thoroughly Christian, the total percentage  of the population that attended church of any kind was only around 60 per- cent. Second, of that number, the percentage who claimed to be Anglicans  was only 51 percent, a number that would decline in the second half of the  century to below 50 percent. The fi rst of these facts became a clarion call to  action for British Protestants regardless of denomination. The second fi nally  toppled the long-standing claim that the Anglican establishment represented  a substantial majority of Britons, which had been a primary rationale for its  privileged status.
 The 1851 census also revealed the extremely robust and diverse state of  Non conformity. It identifi ed thirty different Nonconformist denominations  or sub-denominations of adequate size in membership to merit separate  counting.10 The largest three were the Methodists, of which seven different  subgroups were counted, the Congregationalists, and the Baptists, with six  subgroups. It included the four most noted denominations of “Old Dissent”— Congregationalist, Baptist, Presbyterian, and Quaker—and the four largest de- nominations of “New Dissent” that had emerged from the Evangelical Revival:  Methodist, Calvinist Methodist, Baptist (the minority of total Baptists), and  Unitarian. One traditional distinction between old and new dissent concerns  the difference between Calvinistic theology, according to which only the elect  or predestined can be saved, and Arminian theology, according to which salva- tion is available to all through faith. But even in the eighteenth century only  the minority of dissenters were true Calvinists, and the nineteenth century saw  Calvinism become increasingly unpopular. What most distinguished new from  old dissent was the heightened emphasis on evangelicalism, the spiritual and  moral imperative to spread the word of God.
 While evangelicals were motivated, as Elisabeth Jay notes, by “the heart’s  consciousness of sin and the need for Christ’s redemptive power,” the “insis- tence on the primacy of the individual’s relationship with his Saviour, main- tained through prayer and the search for guidance from Scripture, allowed considerable variation in the interpretation of these ‘vital simplicities’ ” of evan- gelicalism (Jay 1). Indeed, the focus on individual responsibility for one’s salva- tion and individual communion with Scripture and with God—unmediated by  clergy, church, or state—was endemic to Protestantism from its beginning in  the Reformation. It was part of the logical historical trajectory of Protestantism  that each individual could in theory become his or her own minister and his  or her own congregation. This explains why there were an estimated 63,000  non-denominationally-affi liated worshipers in “isolated Congregations” in  England in 1851(groups like the Church of Christ or the Brethren, as vividly  portrayed in Edmond Gosse’s 1907 memoir Father and Son [Parsons, “Dis- senters” 102]). Congregationalists and Baptists were so wary of hierarchical  institutional control that they placed the fi rst-order of authority over theology  and practice with each congregation of individual worshipers.
 For such reasons, Max Weber in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Cap- italism (1905) forwarded a theory of the parallel historical development of   Protestant individualism and the self-satisfying individual of laissez-faire capital- ism. That theory appears to be fully realized in the case of nineteenth- century  Nonconformity. As Gerald Parsons writes in this regard: “Nonconformist the- ology, politics, social leadership, church organization and attitudes to social  reform all reinforced one another. At the heart of this synthesis was a commit- ment to individualism. . . . Thus, paradoxically, commitment to the moral prior- ity of the individual conscience gave early and mid-Victorian Nonconformity a  unity of purpose and an essential common identity and standpoint” (Parsons,  “Dissent” 87). For very good reasons, then, the success of Nonconformity in  the nineteenth century was founded upon “a network of Nonconformist bank- ing, manufacturing and professional families committed to the ideals of mid- Victorian free trade and laissez-fair individualism” that later in the century was  “peculiarly open to an alliance with Gladstonian Liberalism” (Parsons, “Dis- sent” 88). I will return to these features of Protestant individualism in analyz- ing Victorian constructions of Buddhism, but the point to be made now is that  in theory there could have been as many “Christian” responses to Buddhism  as there were individual Protestants, with Catholic responses added on top of  these.
 Thus Deism represented a compromise between the traditional foundation  of Christianity in revealed theology and the rationalism and humanism of the  Enlightenment. From the seventeenth century, “natural religion was used to  uphold the centrality of a reasonable religion embodied in the faith and liturgy  of the Church of England” (Turner, Contesting 47). The signature expres- sion of Deism was the well-known “argument from design,” which was given  clearest articulation in Natural Theology (1802) by William Paley, an Anglican  clergy man and naturalist. The large majority of eminent scientists in eighteenth  and nineteenth-century England were in fact good Anglicans; the history of  British science overlaps signifi cantly with the history of the Church. That is,  until Darwin, when “the house of science so carefully constructed by the pri- marily Anglican founders of the British Association [of Science] collapsed as did  the tradition of British natural theology that had fl ourished for two centuries”  (Turner, Contesting 57). The Descent of Man (1871) undercut the consoling  belief in a benevolent natural universe centered by its creator on the privileged  species, humankind. The failure at mid-century of natural theology to stand  up to scientifi c naturalism created a crisis within the Anglican establishment  and only confi rmed the suspicions of those who from early in the century had  argued not only that the Anglicans were complicit with materialism but that  Christianity in general, however purifi ed by the Protestant Reformation, had  lost touch with genuine spirituality.
 2. They nevertheless were unavoidably a product of the history of Protestantism.  They carried Protestant individualism to its logical extreme, centering heavily on indi- vidual vocation and will, and they distrusted the imposition of institutional structure  on spiritual practice. They also were inherently if not explicitly anti-Catholic.

These trends did not apply to Catholicism, which almost alone resisted plu- ralism, maintaining unity of doctrine and church, and did so while reestablishing  bishops in England for the fi rst time in centuries in 1850 and while the number of  Catholics increased to the end of the century as the number of Anglicans declined.  Catholic commentators, though not theologically pluralistic, generally tended to be  intellectually curious and thorough in their treatments of Buddhism.

 Having large numbers of clergy readers utilizing the British Museum’s  collection of Bibles, commentaries, and concordances did more than con- tribute to the Reading Room’s prestige. From clergy readers, the British  Museum had a sure supply of theological and biblical knowledge due in  large part to their need for sermon resources. As a major labor force within  the Reading Room, clergy readers possessed a unique type of social cur- rency in that they were learned, titled, and intermediaries of the divine.  Their sacred vocation within the Christian church afforded them high lev- els of influence over both elite and working classes. As readers, their social- ization within the Reading Room would have attuned their theological  and biblical knowledge production toward elite power. Furthermore, such  knowledge production would have had immediate dissemination in that  they delivered it weekly through their sermons. In this way elite power  structures had access to a God-fearing public through clergy readers and  their sermons. For the British Imperial State, clergy readers commanded  an assemblage of authoritative currency—the title of Reverend, the church, 110 “The British Museum and the People Who Go There,” 217. 111 Edward B. Aveling, “Some Humors of the Reading Room at the British Museum,” Progress 1 (May 1883): 312. 112 Ibid., 312–13.
 the Bible—all of which could be instrumentalized to impart the ruling  ideology. With clergy readers, the British Museum and its supporting elite  power structures were not only in position to shape theological and bibli- cal discourse but also harness it to perpetuate imperial rule.
 8. The conditions Cockburn enumerates includes “the fall of old sys- tems on the French revolution; the strong feelings of resentment at  our own party intolerance; the obviousness that it was only through  the press that this intolerance could be abated,” and the “dotage of  all existing journals” (LLJ I:125–6).

If the ground of the Edinburgh was economics, then the Quarterly was  founded on a notion of character, and this critique of the Edinburgh  emphasizes Jeffrey’s (like Horner’s) assimilationist view of the relation  of Scotland to England. In 1807, Walter Scott had accused Francis  Jeffrey: “Little by little, whatever your wishes may be . . . [y]ou will  destroy and undermine until nothing of what makes Scotland Scotland shall remain” (Harvie 90). A decade later, Blackwood’s would  similarly  construct its identity in opposition to the Edinburgh’s assimilation- ism (Flynn “Early” 46–8).

 * In February 2006, the Archbishop of Canterbury apologized for the ‘shame and sinfulness of our predecessors’, explaining that ‘the body of Christ is not just a body that exists at any one time, it exists across history’. The previous year he had apologized for the sinfulness of missionaries in imposing Hymns Ancient and Modern on the people of Africa. The empire is very much alive in the Anglican Church. Indeed, the tensions between its different overseas sections may well be the death of it.
 The first large-scale British Protestant missionary movement devel- oped at the end of the 18th century was driven by a mixture of religious beliefs and the growth of the second British Empire.150 The London Missionary Society (LMS) had been founded in 1795 as a non-denominational body at first but increasingly became mainly congregational. Their first goals were the South Sea and India. A mission to China, however, was also contemplated at a very early stage.
 Back in Britain, he set out to rally the merchants and manufacturers in the industrial and commercial towns in the north against the EIC charter. He was joined by the advocates of free trade, who also cam- paigned for the Reform Bill, Catholic Emancipation and the repeal of the Corn Laws.111 The EIC was attacked as a prominent example of ‘Old Corruption’ and its supporters as the typical exponents of those forces that worked against parliamentary reform.112
 The benefits of free trade for society were thus merged with the civilising mission of the British, an issue over which evangelicals and free traders joined their efforts. The adherents of free trade have traditionally been seen as victors in this debate. This does not mean, however, that their opinions were unopposed at the time, nor that criticism of them ceased after 1834.
 The EIC supporters belonged to the ideological spectrum of the ortho- dox Tories, later Conservatives,122 who had developed an alternative political economy, adverse to the evangelical free trade liberalism of their fellow Conservatives, Lord Liverpool, Robert Peel, Henry Goulburn and the like. Their economic protectionism was aimed at preserving the constitutional status quo. Therefore, any measures which might devalue property, such as a repeal of the Corn Laws, were seen as dangerous impingements on private property by the state. In their eyes, it was not competition but rather experience and the continuation of the revolu- tionary settlement of 1688 that provided the best society. At the same time, they believed that through tariffs the government could preserve social stability by providing sufficient consumers for British products. Equally, they saw the Reform Act as dangerously unbalancing the sys- tem of virtual representation, which also included the residents in the British colonies. In addition to this, the abolition of the EIC’s adminis- tration in India would mean direct control by the British government over Indian patronage.123

 Just as Wakefi eld’s father had been deeply concerned with the pressures  of population in Ireland and his work was studded with references to Mal- thus, A Letter can be read as initiating an argument about population that  rejected the claims of Malthus, who saw plans for emigration as at best a  “slight palliative” for the pressures of population and who saw emigration as  plagued with “dangers, diffi  culties, and hardships” that  were not conducive  to building civilized society.20 Despite Malthus’s skepticism of the power of  migration to resolve Britain’s population pressures, Gouger and other asso- ciates of Wakefi eld tried to press- gang Malthus into supporting their visions  of colonization. Aft er the provisional committee of the National Coloniza- tion Society was established in March 1830, Gouger, the Society’s secretary,  held meetings with Malthus, in which Malthus articulated his reservations  about colonization and the Society’s plans. He was subsequently surprised,  therefore, to discover that the Society had represented him as a “decided  approver” of its scheme. In August Malthus underlined his skepticism of  the scheme again in a letter to Sir Robert Wilmot- Horton, the former under- secretary for war and the colonies, who had earlier championed the idea  of assisting British pauper families to resettle in Upper Canada, reaffi  rm- ing his misgivings about the plan to produce “artifi cial concentration” and  his broader doubts about the value of colonies as a solution to population  pressure.21 Th is is an important reminder of the extent to which Wakefi eld’s  advocacy of colonization was pushing against powerful established ideas  about demography, economics, and politics.

 To have the Empire centralized and the Commonwealth de­ centralized, to have the two groups developed on two different  lines, raises grave questions for the future. Is this duality in our  group safe? . . .  I know as a fact that wherever I have gone in the  colonial Empire I have found criticism of this situation.

 In this passage Smuts first projects his political ideals of unselfish mutual ser- vice, loyalty, and duty into the cells of an organism, in the next twist he sug- gests that human politics should aspire and strive for the same ideals, and in the final sentence he binds it all together with a religious allusion to the cre- ation of the world. The humanization of nature and the naturalization of hu- manity needs a religious blessing that can “save the world of matter from ut- ter chaos and change” and bear out the goodness of the creation.
 Following Catholic Emancipation in 1829 there emerged a new and  more independent catholic clergy, and people. It became obvious to the  powers that be, that a system of education along lines acceptable to the  catholic majority was necessary, even as a political expedient. The failure  of the many state-supported education projects, the growth of a more  tolerant attitude to religious beliefs and civil rights, and the widespread  extent of uncontrolled popular schools, the recommendations of suc- cessive commissioners of education inquiry—all these factors prepared  the way for direct state intervention in the provision of education in  Ireland. There was, in addition, the important element of seeing educa- tion as a means of social control, and secondly, the Whig attitude of see- ing it as a panacea for the on-going ills within society. Allied to this was  the concern that the provision of a national system of education would,  it was hoped, bring harmony into Anglo-Irish relations, and effect a dif- fusion of English values, while expunging what was particularly Irish.4
 In the early part of the century it was hoped that ‘the Irish youth  may soon have the English habit and in one or two generations, be true  sticklers for the protestant Church and Interest’.5
 The increasing involvement of Protestant evangelical agencies in  Ireland since the beginning of the nineteenth century led up to the great  Protestant missionary drive known as the ‘Second Reformation’ of the  1820s. With a shared objective of carrying the reformed faith to all alleg- edly in need of spiritual enlightenment, the movement united pious indi- viduals from the major strands of Protestantism under a single banner. By  the early nineteenth century, a number of agencies largely under the aus- pices of the Anglican Church were active in Ireland. These included the  Hibernian Bible Society, established in 1806, the Sunday School Society,  founded in 1809, and the Religious Tract and Book Society, established  in 1810. Some of these societies were supported by the state.
 Other than those mentioned, schools initiated and supported by  protestant Societies peppered the education landscape in the second  half of the eighteenth century and into the nineteenth. All the various  Protestant denominations throughout Britain and Ireland had been  touched by the evangelical revivals associated with the Wesleys in the  eighteenth century and which re-awakened the conscience of Anglicans  and dissenters in the nineteenth. Missionary societies, Bible societies  and other organisations interested in social reform proliferated, and  from amongst these came many concerned with the improvement both  of morality and literacy amongst the poor.13
 A foremost feature of the precepts of the National Board was that  Church and State would become independent of each other-at least in  theory!
 At first, Protestant denominations disagreed with the National  System and its ‘Godless schools’, while Catholics accepted the schools  in the short-term as they were concerned about the levels of illiteracy  within their flock. Subsequently, Catholics came to disagree with the  system on the basis that the pupils were exposed to pro-British and  anti-Catholic influences.
 This system began with a non-sectarian emphasis on the business of  schooling: religion did not form part of the curriculum—it should be  taught outside of school hours by a clergyman from respective religions  or by another person agreed by the community, and not necessarily in  the school building. No material peculiar to any denomination was to  be used in schools, and ministers and priests were excluded from teach- ing posts. This policy encountered stumbling blocks from the begin- ning. Protestant interests first found fault, followed later by Catholic  authorities, and within twenty years the system had become de facto  denominational.1
 Opposition from the Presbyterian Church, led by Dr. Henry Cooke,  led to a protracted series of negotiations, until a formula was devised  in 1840 that allowed for Presbyterian participation in the national sys- tem without scruple. The Church of Ireland established its own Church  Education Society in 1839, and whose schools included Catholics. Sir  Robert Peel denied them a grant, thereby causing financial difficulty,  and they returned to the national system in 1870.2
 The Catholic Church largely accepted the system from the start, and  Archbishop Murray was on the National Board of Education. In 1836  the Christian Brothers withdrew from the system.
 Archbishop MacHale of Tuam was strongly opposed to the national  school system, and later, with the death of Murray and his replacement  by the redoubtable Archbishop Cullen a significant shift in attitude by  the Catholic Church emerged, especially following the Synod of Thurles  in 1850.
 There is some evidence that many hedge schoolteachers in Munster  spoke Irish in the early eighteenth century. The demand, among par- ents, for Irish seemed low. While certain vested evangelical inter- ests, such as The Baptist Society [1814] and The Irish Society [1818]  established schools for teaching Irish-speaking pupils, they were not  responding to a widespread interest or demand. It is ironical that the  organizations that produced Irish and bilingual texts and recruited Irish  speakers as teachers were The Association for Discountenancing Vice and  The London Hibernian Society, along with the other organizations with  an evangelical agenda. They tended, however to be of short duration.16
 The National Schools Loss of faith in the Kildare Place Society project led to the Catholic  community to lobby the government for an alternative educational  provision. The Society was accused of proselytism by Catholic church  leaders and by Daniel O’Connell who resigned from his post as a  member of the KPS board of governors. Following a half century of  government reports and debate, a commission of inquiry was estab- lished in 1824, which produced more reports-nine in total. Following  these a select committee was set up in 1828 under the chairmanship  of Thomas Spring-Rice, a Limerick MP. Its remit was to examine the  various reports on education which had emerged over recent decades.  This committee proposed an education board which would take charge  of combined education of Catholic and Protestant denominations, but  ‘free from the suspicion of Proselytism’.35 Proposals were put forward,  some which highlighted the twin aspects of the new system: secular  instruction by the teacher for four or five days per week and religious  instruction by a cleric to members of his own flock separately from  other denominations. A six-day week was also proposed.
 The national school system was established in the midst of Catholic  Emancipation (1829) and the Reform Act (1832). The new education  system for Ireland was a Whig initiative, reflecting Anglican liberal  thought regarding social issues. The 1830s also witnessed the intro- duction of a new police force along with a new health service. The new  schools were expected to act as institutional proof: …that politically warring factions were in fact both reconcilable and  compatible. In the 1830s this entailed a demonstration of the similari- ties not between rich and poor, nor between the indigenous and the for- eign, but between the Anglican and the Dissenter, the Protestant and  the Catholic, that is between the religious groups newly admitted into  polity.38
 One of the chief ambitions of the national school system was to recon- cile Catholics to the British state: when Stanley introduced his plan in  1831 he remarked that government ought not ‘to oppose the Catholic  priesthood and the people, but to bring the priesthood, and the people  through their influence, into an amicable and friendly relation with the  government.’39
 Scriptural extracts avoided any possibility of denominational bias.  Moral fables, prayers and religious poetry were denominationally neu- tral. The Board appointed inspectors. Model Schools would provide  teacher training, a practice which had been begun by the Kildare Place  Society. The preference of the different creeds was for denominational  education. Early in the life of the National School system Catholic  authorities accepted the type of system offered by the government.  Archbishop Murray of Dublin was one of the catholic prelates who sup- ported the system. On the other hand, Dr. Paul Cullen, later Catholic  Archbishop of Dublin, was quite hostile to mixed education. In his  pastoral letter, he spoke of ‘Catholic education, on Catholic principles,  Catholic masters and the use of Catholic books’. The gradual erosion of  the mixed principle led to a situation by 1850 that national schools had  become sectarian where Catholics went to catholic schools and protes- tants went to protestant schools. By mid-century E. G. Stanley’s ideal of  non-denominational education was crumbling in the face of a sectarian  onslaught.
 The curriculum propagated by the Commissioners who were the  overlords of the national school system included virtually no history-  apart from ancient, distant material. Since Catholics were the majority,  the costs of allowing inculcation of disloyalty among Catholic children might be deemed to outweigh the benefits of bolstering loyalty among  Protestants. The attraction for this approach was that all history was  intrinsically subversive in an already divided society.
 During the nineteenth century, the Commissioners acted on the  premise that non-partisan history was unfeasible. Since their rules  prohibited lessons that might offend anybody on religious or political  grounds, they simply eliminated all systematic teaching of history from  the curriculum. Ironically, an Irish history reader was adopted by the  Church Education Society in 1854 and, and again in 1857.44
 The absence of an authentic Irish cultural, historical, geographi- cal and religious dimension was corrected, to a limited extent, in the  new editions from 1867 onwards. However, the overall aim of develop- ing loyalty to the British administration was paramount. Within their  own terms the Commissioners, together with their compilers were quite  enlightened and well intentioned in ensuring the content of the books  was non-controversial and neutral in terms of religious denomination.
 The Third Book of Lessons The Third Book of Lessons (for nine-year olds) continues in a similar  ideological vein to the other books at the more junior levels. It con- tains fifty pages of Old Testament extracts, interspersed with religious  poetry, dealing with the period from the birth of Isaac to the time of  the Ten Commandments. The preface to the Third Book explains  that it is expected pupils reading this book will also ‘be made to read  the scripture lessons recommended by the Commissioners’.1 The  Commissioners’ mindset favoured a curriculum in schools which was  Christian but non-confessional2: …it was not that Stanley and the British government favoured non-  confessional education, but that it was the best a Protestant adminis- tration could hope for in an Ireland where Catholic political power was  advancing steadily. The dismal reality for the government was that the  schools soon established themselves largely on confessional lines, and in  the system’s early days it was, ironically, the Protestants who, unsettled by  the political earthquake of Catholic emancipation, were most hostile and  suspicious about issues of church access and control.3
 By mid-nineteenth century the national schools were functioning along  confessional lines. The books in use were aligned perfectly with the  wishes of the commissioners and conformed to the system’s regulations.
 The unrealistic perspectives of the compilers, who came from a dif- ferent social class to their audience created a tone of insensitivity and  superiority that was quite unsympathetic and patronizing; it helped  perpetuate class divisions, which, from our perspectives, were dis- tinctly feudal. The Rev. James Carlile, the chief compiler, was largely  responsible for the Presbyterian ethos, the strict moral tone and the  virtues of unquestioning obedience, equable temper and respectful  deportment. A combination of Evangelical fervour and an empha- sis on duty and subservience gave the book an unattractive preachy,  self-righteous tone.
 An ideal mechanism or strategy to ensure religious, cultural, social,  and political accord within the long-established colonies, such as  Ireland, and the more recent ones, such as Australia, was to introduce  a state-supported system of education which was liberal (and gener- ally acceptable to all the vested groups). As Kevin Lougheed puts this:  ‘There was a transformation in the nature of state policy from a tool for  proselytising children to a governmental technology aimed at shifting  the behaviour of the whole population.’62
 One of the aims of the 1831 experiment with education in Ireland  was to unite the different denominations under one roof, as it were.  However, it seems likely that the national school system copper-fastened  the walls between them. Within twenty years, a de facto situation had  emerged, where segregation had replaced integration. ‘The school sys- tem that had been intended as an antidote for Ireland’s sectarian prob- lem had become not the solution but part of the problem’.3

 Fundamental variations in church architecture also accorded with denomina- tional di�erence. Christianity in early modern Britain was divided into distinct  groups: the Protestant Church of England (or Anglicans), Roman Catholics,  and nonconformist Protestant groups who broke away from the Church of  England, such as Puritans, Quakers, and Methodists. Within Britain, religious  a�liation and dissent were the source of political and cultural con�ict, and  British colonial history is as much delineated by the migration of religious  groups from Britain caught up in these troubles as it is by trade or war with  foreign powers.
 Churches also played a significant role in imperialist activities that took place  within Britain in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In Scotland, following  the religious conflict that underpinned the Jacobite Uprising (1745–6), with the  Highland clans supporting the Catholic Stuarts over the Protestant Hanoverians, 32 See L. P. Nelson, The Beauty of Holiness: Anglicanism and Architecture in Colonial South Carolina  (Chapel Hill, 2009).
 https://www.flickr.com/photos/billread/449558802/ https://www.flickr.com/photos/billread/449558802/ the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK), funded the  construction  of Protestant, Church of Scotland, churches and schools—often in a single, multi- purpose structure—throughout the Highlands in the later eighteenth century.  �is programme of church building was intended to ‘civilize’ the mostly Roman  Catholic Gaelic population. �e presence of these plain geometric buildings in the  Highland landscape was deeply signi�cant.
 In Ireland, as part of the programme of plantations in the seventeenth century,  Protestantism was forced upon the Roman Catholic population through the con- �scation of all lands and buildings belonging to the Catholic Church. All Irish  churches, dating from the medieval period to the seventeenth century, were recast  as ‘Church of Ireland’ (the name for the Anglican church in Ireland). For example,  the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Dublin has been the seat of the Church of  Ireland since the sixteenth century. However, the church itself dates from the  twelfth century and therefore was the seat of the Roman Catholic Church in  Ireland for over four hundred years. By the eighteenth century, new churches were  built to re�ect the wealth and taste of the Anglo-Irish establishment. In Dublin,  the centre of Anglo-Irish culture, the work of neoclassical architect John Smyth is  prominent, as seen, for example, in the pedimented portico of St Catherine’s  (1760–9) (see Figure  5.4) and the interior of St Werburgh’s (1754). At both  churches, in a direct act of colonial image-making, Smyth’s task was to classicize, Figure 1.12. St Mary’s Church, Madras (1680–1795) (Sylvia Murphy).
 �e other major attempt at perpetuating this urban planning tradition in British  North America was the city of Savannah, in the Province of Georgia (Georgia  Colony), developed in 1734 by soldier and Jacobite sympathizer, James Oglethorpe.7  Oglethorpe, who was ably assisted in his endeavour to promote the colony of  Georgia by John Perceval, founded his idea on the traditional notion that Britain’s  overseas colonies were places where the less savoury yet conscientious and able in  British society ought to be sent to ‘improve’ themselves—in e�ect, social dumping  grounds. Given its proximity to Spanish Florida, the colony was also intended to  serve as a territorial bu�er between the existing Spanish and established English  colonies on the eastern seaboard of the North American continent, with many of its  new settlers envisaged as ‘farmer-soldiers’.
 �e marked di�erences in the plan for Annapolis raise obvious questions about  the correlation between urban planning and visions of social and political order.  Francis Nicholson (1655–1728) was a royal governor, a member of the Royal Society  (which had also claimed Wren and Evelyn among its ranks), and an unabashed  monarchist. His extension of an aristocratic social and political structure with a Figure 2.5. ‘A Ground Plat of the City and Port of Annapolis’ (Maryland) by James  Stoddert (1743) (Collection of the Maryland State Archives).

 RELIGION, ARCHITECTURE, AND EARLY  COLONIZ ATION: THE FIRST TWO CENTURIES �e half century between the Restoration in 1660 and the rise of the Hanoverians  in 1714 included an important sequence of events that turned attention to the  challenge of church construction, especially Protestant church construction, both  in England and across the English (later British) colonial world. �e restoration of  the episcopacy in 1660 opened the door to an intensive wave of church inspection  and repair across England after twenty years of neglect. If the Diocese of York is  any indication, more than half of England’s churches required and received some  repair in the latter decades of the seventeenth century.4 Indeed, despite Victorian  aspersions of neglect, the regular maintenance of churches was a continued prac- tice through the eighteenth century.5 �e great London �re of 1666 launched a  massive church building and rebuilding campaign in that city that would last into  the early years of the eighteenth century. At around this time, on 16 June 1701  to  be precise, King William III issued a Royal Charter to the Society for the  T.

 Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) to commission and send minis- ters to England’s colonial territories in America, including the West Indies.6 �e  in�ux of ministers that resulted triggered a wave of church building across the  colonies. In 1710 Queen Anne signed an act for the building of �fty new churches  in the cities of London and Westminster, largely as a response to rapid population  growth after the Great Fire. While few of these were built, they provided models  for city churches across the empire. In addition, she established the Board of the  First Fruits in 1711, funded by a tax on clerical incomes, as a means to assist the  Church of Ireland to build new Protestant churches and glebe houses among  Ireland’s majority Catholic population (see Chapter 1, p. 41).7 �roughout this  period, Anglicans built new churches in places ranging from Ireland to New England  and the Caribbean, although the greatest concentrations were in the colonies of  Virginia, South Carolina, and Jamaica.8 �us, the late seventeenth and early eight- eenth centuries were a fruitful age for church construction in England and its  empire.
 Conditions in the colonies, of course, were di�erent from those in England.  During the seventeenth century, the Church of England had functioned as the  state church in a number of England’s colonial territories. �ese included Virginia  on the North American mainland, and Barbados, St Christopher, and Jamaica in  the West Indies. In Ireland Anglicanism was instituted as the state religion through  the concomitant Church of Ireland (est. 1536). As local representatives of the state  church, Anglican parishes became political districts, and Anglican vestries were  given the responsibility of ensuring regular worship in the parish church and car- ing for the poor.9 But the in�ux of new priests funded by the SPG bolstered  Anglican worship and political authority. �e Church of England became the state  church in Maryland and South Carolina by legislation in 1702 and 1706 respec- tively. While Anglicans were present and active throughout the more northerly  colonies on the North American mainland, the church was not established as a  state church in the same way that it was further south. Given the absence of any  bishops in colonial places, all American colonial parishes fell under the jurisdiction  of the Bishop of London. In many of these places, one of the stated responsibilities  of the  colonial church—at least in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centu- ries—was to concentrate on the conversion of ‘natives’: Native Americans on the  American mainland, Africans in the American South and the West Indies, and 6 On the SPG, see D.

 native (Catholic) Irish in Ireland. �e Anglican Church was inextricably linked  with the project of empire.
 Furthermore, the social, cultural, and political complexity of Britain’s empire  also meant that colonies claimed populations of other religious adherents. �e  colonies therefore abounded with congregations of non-Anglicans, the greatest  concentration of which were to be found in New England. �e New England  meeting-house, for example, is a distinctive building type that emerged from the  settlement of religious dissidents and refugees as they made their way to the ‘new  world’ to establish colonies of their own. Moreover, in certain parts of the British  empire, especially Ireland and Quebec, Roman Catholicism was the predominant  denomination. As we shall see, this had architectural consequences of its own.  Social and professional networks were also drawn upon in constructing these com- peting visions of the New Jerusalem, where congregations of believers (Quakers  and Jews among then) found themselves in regular communication with one  another, not just within individual colonies but right across the British world,  fostering very particular concepts of identity and experience.
 Beginning with Anglicanism, we �nd that ecclesiastical buildings erected by  adherents of the Church of England across the English (and then British) empire  varied quite widely in plan and appearance. Yet, as Nigel Yates has shown, the  majority of Anglican churches defaulted to a conservative tradition that espoused  the material distinction of the church interior into two chambers: a nave for ordi- nary service and a chancel for the celebration of the sacrament.0 At least one-third  (but more likely something closer to one-half ) of all churches newly erected across  England in this era took this form, achieved either through a narrow, deep chancel  projecting from a wider nave, or the installation of a chancel screen creating two  chambers out of one longitudinal footprint, or both. �is segregation into distinct  chambers gave primacy to two of the three liturgical centres of the church, with the  preaching pulpit dominating the nave while the communion table sat either cen- trally within the chancel or against the east wall. �e third liturgical centre, the  baptismal font, generally retained its ancient position near the main or west door  of the church. �is arrangement resulted in a fairly common building form con- sisting of a large mass for the nave (with or without a smaller chancel projection  from the east end) and, commonly, a western tower. �ere is abundant evidence of  this building form across the colonies in the late seventeenth century. Surviving  examples that represent this pattern include Ballinderry Middle Church in Lisburn,  Co. Antrim (c.1668), St Patrick’s Church, Waterford (c.1680), and St Mary’s,  Dublin (c.1700) in Ireland (see Plate 9); Newport Parish church (c.1685) and  St  Peter’s Parish Church (1701–3, tower 1739–40) in Virginia; the Valley  Church—St Mary’s Parish (c.1689), Antigua; and possibly St Anne’s, Sandy Point,  St Kitts (late seventeenth century).
 Even so, the Great Fire of London set the stage for the �rst broad experimentation  with Anglican church planning. Christopher Wren has been widely recognized 0 N. Yates, Buildings, Faith and Worship: �e Liturgical Arrangement of Anglican Churches, 1600–1900  (Oxford, 1991, revised edition 2000), chapter 4.
 as  the architect who popularized the Anglican model of an ‘auditory church’.  Writing near the end of his career, Wren drafted a letter that expounded at length  on his experience in London parish church design. In addition to commentaries  on materials, building in an urban setting, and the inappropriateness of urban  cemeteries, he also argued that church plans should respond to the practical con- straints of audibility, an extension of his scienti�c interest in sound. To that end,  Wren argued that churches should not be more than 60-ft wide and 90-ft long in  order that everyone inside might be able to hear the preacher, since ‘a moderate  Voice may be heard 50 Feet distant before the Preacher, 30 feet on each side, and  20 behind the Pulpit . . . without losing the Voice at the last Word of the Sentence’.  He further argued that given di�erences in emphasis, ‘a French Man is heard fur- ther than an English Preacher’, reinforcing the idea that his recommendations  resulted from experimentation. When providing an exemplar in his letter, Wren  o�ered St James, Piccadilly (1676–84)—a compact, rectangular auditory church.  However, to assign the introduction of the auditory Anglican church entirely to  Wren is to misunderstand the historical development of architectural typologies.  As Peter Guillery has demonstrated, London had a number of pre-�re examples of  ‘auditory’ churches and meeting-houses, most especially the Broadway Chapel in  Westminster. Furthermore, the development of auditory planning for new  Anglican churches occurred beyond London before and during Wren’s city church  building programme.4 Similar meeting-houses could be found on the Continent  as well, from France to the Netherlands.5 �us, while the very fact of the auditory  church cannot be assigned to Wren, the signi�cance of his church architecture lies  most securely in his experimentation and articulation of auditory principles.6
 A brief survey of those churches erected by Anglicans in the American colonies  o�ers a telling perspective on various aspects of late seventeenth- and eighteenth-  century church building practices. Carl Lounsbury has made the critical observa- tion that the establishment date of a colony appears to have played a role in shaping  local traditions of Anglican church design. In comparing the Anglican churches in  the adjacent colonies of Virginia and Maryland, for instance, Lounsbury notes  that, generally, longitudinal parish churches in Virginia parallel their counterparts  See ‘Letter on Building Churches’, in L. M. Soo, Wren’s ‘Tracts’ on Architecture and Other Writings  (Cambridge, 1998), pp. 107–11; see also P. Gouk, ‘�e Role of Acoustics and Music �eory in the  Scienti�c Work of Robert Hooke’, Annals of Science, vol. 37 (1980), pp. 573–605.

White, Protestant Worship and Church Architecture (Oxford, 1964), pp. 78–117.
 in England throughout the seventeenth and well into the eighteenth century. Yet,  in Maryland (a much younger colony than Virginia), parish churches correlate  strongly with the more compact auditory planning of the fashionable urban  churches built in London in the very late seventeenth century and early eight- eenth. Without the inscription of the older tradition in the landscape, Lounsbury  argues, the younger colony of Maryland adopted the newer auditory formula  more freely.7
 A second signi�cant pattern among eighteenth-century colonial Anglican  churches is also observable. Dell Upton’s careful analysis of parish churches in  Virginia makes clear that during the seventeenth century churches were generally  longitudinal, with a conceptual division between the nave and the chancel, similar  to those in contemporary England. When these parishes required larger buildings,  they often expanded by adding an extension perpendicular to the main building,  resulting in a ‘T’ plan. But some early eighteenth-century parishes, faced with  the  prospect of building anew, opted instead for cruciform planned churches  (Figure  5.1). Upton understands these buildings as accommodating the new  demands on audibility in large church buildings.8 But the cruciform church was  not unique to colonial Virginia.9 Even though newly built cruciform churches  were rare in eighteenth-century England, and were a sizable minority in Virginia  and in South Carolina, they were in the majority in Jamaica and Bermuda. �ey  were also common in the rural parishes of eighteenth-century Ireland.0 In add- ition to accommodating the increasing sensitivity for audibility, it seems likely that  the cruciform shape was also intended to be symbolic. St Paul’s parish church in  South Carolina was described as bearing ‘the form of a cross’, while St Andrew’s in  the same colony was described as enlarged ‘in the form of a cross’. In their desire  to distinguish or set apart their new churches in a newly colonized landscape,  Anglicans revealed a theological parallel between the baptism of a child and the  consecration of a church. Both were ritual acts of inscription that extended a claim  about the spiritual dwelling of God—one in a person, the other in a building.  Making the sign of the cross on the forehead of a child consecrated him or her for  service in the church. Similarly, the use of a cross in the form of the church might  have been seen as consecrating the land upon which it stands and protecting it  ‘against sin, the world, and the devil’. Even so, the shape was never entirely theo- logical. �e cruciform plan in Jamaica might simply have been a comforting and  familiar cultural marker of Englishness in an environmentally dangerous and  racially unfamiliar landscape. Anglicans in colonial contexts built churches that 7 C. Lounsbury, ‘Anglican Church Design in the Chesapeake: English Inheritances and Regional  Interpretations’, in A. K. Hoagland and K. A. Breisch (eds), Constructing Image, Identity, and Place:  Perspectives in Vernacular Architecture IX (Knoxville, 2003), pp. 22–38.

 One of the most prominent non-Anglican Protestant building traditions to  emerge as a result of English colonial expansion was that of dissenting meeting-  houses erected in New England in the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries  (see Figure 1.9). �ese colonies and their religious communities were established  as safe havens of dissenting worship set apart from the clear authority and oversight  of Anglican-dominated England. �e single open space of the typical meeting-  house interior was usually focused upon an elaborate, centrally located pulpit on  the long wall opposite the main door. �e other three sides were often surrounded  by a broad gallery elevated over a warren of box pews on the �oor below. �e   typical meeting-house was essentially an auditorium, and nothing more. In a  recent study of more than two thousand such buildings in New England and on  Long Island between 1622 and 1830, Peter Benes has demonstrated the gradual  transformation of the meeting-house from a square type in the seventeenth cen- tury to a more ‘churchly’ building in the early nineteenth. Over this period  building use evolved from a public space for almost any use—including adjudicat- ing civil cases—to sanctuaries reserved for the worship of God. So-called ‘Four- square’ meeting-houses were the earliest and most predominant form in New  England through the seventeenth century. �ere is a debate, however, as to whether  P.

 Complicating the range of sources is the fact that William Andrews, the builder  of the foursquare New Haven meeting-house (1639), had likely spent time in the  Netherlands before immigrating to New England, where numerous examples of  similar buildings erected by Reformed congregations were to be found. Such  buildings also existed in France and Scotland. �is suggests that the meeting-houses  erected in early seventeenth-century New England were part of an emerging con- vergent Protestant tradition which reached its apogee just as the congregations in  New England began to build, positioning New England’s early Puritans—all too  frequently thought of as fringe dissidents on the edge of empire—as participants  in a self-aware Reformed community that stretched across the British Isles,  Northern Europe, and the Americas—a migration made possible only through the  politics and reach of England’s then emergent empire.
 While Protestants were certainly in the majority among Christian communities  across the British empire, there were other denominations scattered throughout,  the greatest concentration being the Catholics of Ireland. A 1732 survey of church  buildings in Ireland indicates that in that year Ireland maintained over 900  Catholic churches, 200 of which had been recently erected. Even so, the majority  of datable surviving examples are from the later eighteenth century.8 �ese build- ings di�ered markedly from their Church of Ireland (Anglican) counterparts,  which usually enjoyed the bounty of state co�ers for their construction. As a result,  Catholic churches were generally simpler, box-like buildings, not dissimilar in  external appearance to Presbyterian meeting-houses. Most of the surviving urban 8 M. Craig, �e Architecture of Ireland: From the Earliest times to 1880 (Dublin, 1982), pp. 212,  216.
 Roman Catholics maintained a substantial presence in North America as well,  particularly in the predominantly French north (Acadia) and Spanish south (New  Spain). At the end of the Seven Years’ War the colony of New France (what is now  essentially Quebec) was formally ceded to the British at the Treaty of Paris (1763).  Quebec, or Lower Canada as it became known, was thus subsumed within the  British empire. Crucially, however, the residents of Quebec were allowed to keep  their language, religion, French civil law, and seigneurial system. What this meant  was that the substantial amount of religious architecture produced in Quebec not  only belonged to a di�erent European tradition (French) but continued to respond  to this tradition well after the province had become British territory. Indeed, in the  decades following the conquest of New France, the Catholic Church used its posi- tion deliberately to revive and promote traditional Acadian ecclesiastical forms as  a gesture towards nationalism and an expression of its renewed authority.9 A good  example of this is the Église Sainte-Marguerite at L’Acadie (1800–1), erected under  the direction of Abbé Pierre Conefroy (1752–1816), the vicar-general of the dio- cese of Quebec for the Montreal region. In many respects this is a classic French  colonial church that embodies planning principles dating back to the time of  François-Xavier de Montmorency-Lavalde Montigny, �rst Bishop of Quebec  (1674), as well as several Jesuit missionary features. It was also constructed using  rubble stone, with the west gable surmounted by a clocher with open belfry—both  characteristics of the French colonial manner.0 Not surprisingly, the French man- ner of ecclesiastical architecture in Quebec continued well into the nineteenth  century, and may be seen in its own way as a form of religious and cultural resist- ance to wider British, and therefore Protestant, values and ideals.
 In addition to broad denominational patterns that shaped religious architecture  across the empire, the rapid urbanization of eighteenth-century England and its  colonies was a major catalyst for new church construction. In 1710 Parliament  appointed a building commission to undertake the construction of �fty new  churches in the expanding suburbs of London and Westminster. While this pro- gramme resulted only in eleven �nished churches, it triggered a lively conversation  among architects and churchmen on the proper form of an Anglican church—one  that would generate scores of architectural drawings, sixteen wooden models, and  have an impact across England and its burgeoning empire. �e rapid expansion  of many cities and towns beyond London, including those such as Birmingham  and Bristol, required the subdivision of urban parishes and the construction of a  D.

 substantial number of new urban churches.4 Over the course of the eighteenth  century, Parliament passed 114 separate acts concerned with the construction or  reconstruction of parish churches, the majority of which were in locations outside  of London.5 Not limited to the motherland, this urban church building phenom- enon marked the urbanity and identity of Anglicans during the eighteenth century  through the erection of monumental city churches.
 But if the study and emulation of speci�c ancient or biblical buildings was not  widespread, the general emulation of antique temples was commonplace in city  churches across the empire. In his monumental study of the eighteenth-century  church in Britain, Terry Friedman has argued convincingly that by the early eight- eenth century architects designed churches intentionally in the form of antique  temples. �ese designs ranged from the peripheral temple with free-standing col- umns entirely surrounding the body of the church, to the more common practice  of designing the primary façade of a church with a portico or temple-front.4 An  excellent example is St Catherine’s Church in Dublin (1760) by John Smyth  (Figure 5.4). Here a monumental temple-front commands the central three bays of 4 See W. M. Jacob, Lay People and Religion (Cambridge, 2002), pp. 201–3; P.

 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY: DAWN OF A NEW ERA By the time we reach the nineteenth century revived Gothic becomes the most  common architectural language for ecclesiastical buildings in Britain and its  empire. �e advance of this style throughout the colonies was pegged �rmly to  increased church extension and missionary activity. Indeed, as outlined above, the  Christian missionary enterprise in its broadest, non-denominational sense had 4 Ibid., pp. 609–10; R. Tavernor, Palladio and Palladianism (London, 1991), pp. 181–7; S.

 long been a concern to Britain as a colonizing power. But it was only in the late  eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that a serious organizational imperative  arose, both among Nonconformists and the established Church of England. But  the Church of England, despite having three a�liate missionary organizations by  1800—the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (1699), the SPG (1701),  and the Church Missionary Society (CMS, 1799)—had accomplished little in  terms of evangelizing the non-European world.
 It was not until around the beginning of the 1840s that the perceived need to  promote Christianity as part of British imperial policy took root in the ‘o�cial  mind’ of the ruling elite. �e powerful religious sensibilities of Victorian society  necessarily a�ected the way Britain perceived itself and its moral obligation to the  wider world, particularly its own colonial empire.44 �us, the Colonial Bishoprics’  Fund (CBF) was founded in 1841 for the purpose of establishing o�cially sanc- tioned Church of England dioceses abroad. A number of such dioceses already  existed by this time, including Nova Scotia (1787), Calcutta (1814), and Jamaica  (1824), but the advent of the CBF, along with the reinvigoration of the somewhat  moribund SPG, provided considerable impetus in terms of motivation, money,  and manpower. In the thirty years between its inauguration and c.1870, the CBF  was responsible for erecting around forty new dioceses, where only ten had been  founded in the previous 250 years of British colonial expansion.
 With this came a wave of church building activity. As the ideas of A. W. N. Pugin  (1812–52) regarding the Christian basis of Gothic architecture began to penetrate  Anglican circles, societies dedicated speci�cally to the promotion of medieval archi- tecture were formed, including the Ecclesiological (formerly Cambridge Camden)  Society and the Oxford Society for Promoting the Study of Gothic Architecture,  both founded in 1839. �e Ecclesiological Society’s ideas were particularly wide- spread and in�uential, and under its auspices the Gothic Revival acquired the lustre  of a serious, ‘scienti�c’, and even crusade-like endeavour.
 Importantly, the ideologies entrenched concerning medieval architecture’s  claims to origins, authenticity, and ‘truthfulness’—all notions that appealed to the  morally encumbered Victorian frame of mind—were carried to Britain’s colonies  via a new and younger breed of Oxbridge-educated clergyman. �ese clergy saw it  as partly their responsibility to promulgate Gothic architecture within a wider  regime of orderliness and propriety concerning the religious character, moral  veracity, and loyalist sympathies of colonial society, including a greater sense of  urgency towards evangelizing indigenous peoples.
 In this sense, the rather sudden deployment of this style of architecture had a  four-fold purpose: to inspire and thereby transform the state of Christianity among  the expatriate settler communities of the British empire through its perceived  beauty, integrity, and solemnity; to introduce higher levels of reverence, spirituality,  and propriety through reformed liturgical practices; to mark out and identify the  urban and rural landscapes of Britain’s empire as being associated with a particular 44 G. A. Bremner, Imperial Gothic: Religious Architecture and High Anglican Culture in the British  Empire, c.1840–70 (New Haven and London, 2013).
 �e early leaders in this endeavour were clergymen, not architects, as very little  if any architectural expertise existed on the colonial frontier. �ere are numerous  examples of clergymen acting as both designers and builders of churches, such as  the Rev. F. H. Cox (1821–1906) of Tasmania. Cox, like his bishop, the Rev. Francis  Nixon (1803–79) of Hobart, were typical of this new breed of Anglican cleric who  took the idea of ‘correct’ church architecture seriously. �e Tractarian spirit with  which they were imbued necessitated that they hold the proper ordinance of the  sacraments in high regard, along with their formal con�guration. It was here that  organizations such as the Ecclesiological Society proved particularly useful. Seeing  the British colonial world as very much within its authoritative ambit, the Society  sent three church designs by R. C. Carpenter to Tasmania. �e designs were for  three buildings of varying sizes, to be used depending upon circumstance, with  Cox using the smallest as the basis for the parish church of St John the Baptist  (1847), Prosser Plains (Buckland), near Hobart—among the very �rst Anglican  churches of its kind in the British empire (Figure 5.6).
 �is approach, which exploited the extensive network of Anglican clerical ties  throughout the ever-expanding British world would become something of a pat- tern as more and more Anglican dioceses were erected across Britain’s empire  during the nineteenth century. �ere are numerous other examples one could  point to, including the assistance given to bishops G. A. Selwyn of New Zealand,  John Medley of New Brunswick (see Figure  7.12), and James Chapman of  Colombo (Sri Lanka). Indeed, when asked how many churches around the world  had been a�ected by the ideas of the Ecclesiological Society, John Mason Neale  (one of the Society’s co-founders) is reputed to have replied: ‘It would be as di�- cult almost as to count the stars on a clear frosty night.’46 �e increasing ease with  which architectural literature in the form of journals, magazines, and pattern  books could be accessed by this time also played a role in the transmission of this  new architectural economy (for Selwyn and New Zealand in this regard, see  Chapter 10, pp. 363–4).47
 If Anglicans, initially at least, were less well prepared, the same cannot be said of  the Roman Catholic Church and its missionaries. Church ritual and ceremony,  including its proper architectural setting, were of course central to Catholic wor- ship. �is concern followed Catholics more or less wherever they went, including  into British colonial territory. �rough emancipation (1829), enhanced seminary  education, and the e�orts of internationally orientated organizations such as the  Association for the Propagation of the Faith, plans to extend the presence of the  Catholic faith in Britain’s colonies were well underway by the early part of the nine- teenth century.48 Again, Australia was targeted early on by Catholics owing partly  to its large Irish immigrant population (both convicts and those escaping poverty  and starvation), and partly because of the potential it o�ered to extend Roman  Catholic in�uence in a society that was often characterized as irreligious.
 5 Architecturally speaking, the Roman Catholic Church was of course active throughout the British  empire. For Canada, see M. �urlby, ‘Joseph Connolly in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kingston,  Ontario’, Journal of the Society for the Study of Architecture in Canada (  JSSAC ), vol. 30:2 (2005), pp. 25–38.
 By the 1850s Presbyterian and Nonconformist congregations had begun mov- ing in the direction of Gothic as well. Although there were a number of experi- ments in so-called ‘Dissenting Gothic’ among Unitarian and Congregationalist  communities in Britain dating from the 1840s, this approach was not common.  Until this point Nonconformist architecture had largely been a utilitarian a�air.  �e otherworldly theology of orthodox Protestantism had not necessarily encour- aged the pursuit of such lowly matters as architecture—almost any building could  serve as a Methodist chapel, for instance. If any ‘style’ was adopted at all, it tended  to be a plain form of classicism—what the Rev. Frederick Jobson referred to as the  ‘usual style’. To be sure, John Ruskin’s elegant musings on the nature and meaning  of medieval architecture had begun to liberate Gothic architecture from ‘popish’  associations, but it was not until the publication of Jobson’s Chapel and School  Architecture (1850), followed by James Cubitt’s Church Design for Congregations  (1870), that Gothic forms among Nonconformist communities began to acquire  broader and more consistent appeal.56
 Chapel (1845–50), Grahamstown, with its elaborate Gothic façade.57 Although  not a sophisticated use of the style, it nevertheless demonstrates that Methodists  were open to Gothic forms. Why this occurred so early in some cases is di�cult to  ascertain, but it probably had something to do with the perceived liberty to use  medieval styles in a context where the Church of England was not established, and  where the taint of Roman Catholicism and its associations was largely absent.

 context as ‘Tropical Pointed’.60 Indeed, as Webb’s friend and colleague A. J. B.  Beresford Hope reminded the Society’s members: Our present studies proceed upon the ever-present assumption that the Christian  Church is a living and an energizing body. . . . We must not . . . con�ne ourselves to  England or to the Western Church, we must penetrate to the East and her venerable  hereditary uses. . . . We should remember that Great Britain reigns over the torrid and  the hyperborean zone, that she will soon have to rear temples of the True Faith in  Benares and Labrador, Newfoundland and Cathay.6
 Culturally speaking, adaptation was also important. In foreign contexts, and  on the mission �eld, especially where clergymen encountered large numbers of  non-Christian indigenes, means of controlling access to church buildings  became a problem. In such contexts the resurrection of medieval spatial devices  such as porches and narthexes became necessary. Such devices were adopted, for  example, in the context of East Africa under the auspices of the Universities’  Mission to Central Africa (UMCA), where careful liturgical arrangements were  made in the design of churches to separate ‘inquirers’ and catechumens from  Christians.66

 CONSTRUCTING INSTITUTIONS: EDUCATION,  ARCHITECTURE, AND EMPIRE Closely allied to religion and the missionary endeavour was the extension of  European educational practices to the non-European world. �ese were not only  forms of cultural imperialism, but they also went hand in hand with colonial  expansion to the extent that it was often left to religious institutions to establish  schools, particularly during the initial phases of settlement. If we are to view  Ireland as an English colony, then Trinity College, Dublin, is the earliest such  institution, founded by Royal Charter in 1592. A staunchly Protestant enterprise,  the college was intended as a bastion for the political elite in tightening their grip  on power in Ireland. It was perceived by its supporters as surpassing even the zeal  of Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1584), upon which it was  modelled, in ‘sus- taining a godly curriculum and environment’.70 Beyond the British Isles, the  earliest such establishment, and another descendant of Emmanuel College, was  Harvard College (originally ‘New College’) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded  in 1636, the college would eventually take the name of its initial benefactor (1638),  the London-born, Cambridge-educated Puritan minister, John Harvard (1607–38).  �e �rst buildings at Harvard were existing houses purchased from town residents.  But by the early 1640s it had been decided that the students were to be ‘brought  up in a more Collegiate Way of Living’, and so a new, purpose-built facility was  erected. ‘Old’ or ‘Harvard’ College, as this ‘very faire and comely’ structure became  known, was monumental in scale and based on aspects of Eton College in England.  It was also the largest building in New England at the time. Eventually an informal  open quadrangle would take shape around ‘the Yard’, including a President’s  Lodge, Go�e College, and an Indian College (1650s). Like the structures that  would replace these in the 1670s, the initial foundation buildings at Harvard were  generally large, singular blocks with �oors housing all the various functions neces- sary of an educational institution (Figure 5.11).7 Both Trinity College, Dublin,  and Harvard College demonstrate the close ties education was seen to have, ideo- logically speaking, with religion in the expansion of the British state during the late  sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.
 dissenting Protestant communities. As a result, these colleges were founded and  then expanded without a chapel, which was a marked departure from the English  Oxbridge precedent.
 By the beginning of the nineteenth century the �rst educational establishments  of this kind began to appear in British India. �e missionary connection was  strong, with the CMS, the SPCK, and the SPG all leading the charge for the foun- dation of what would become Bishop’s College, Calcutta (est. 1820). By this time  the Anglican diocese of Calcutta had already been established (1814), with arch- deaconries in Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay. �e Rev. �omas F. Middleton  (1769–1822) presided as �rst bishop over what was a huge see, including all of  India and Australia. Initially wary of Christian missionary intervention, the EIC  donated the land upon which the new College would rise. Rendered in a simple  but clear Gothic Revival idiom, its cultural and religious intentions were clear. Its  purpose was fourfold: to train Indians for the service of the Church; to o�er secular  teaching to other Indians; to translate Christian literature; and to prepare new  missionaries.75 Over £50,000 was raised for the cause, with Middleton observing 7 Ibid., pp. 33–7. 74 �ese plans are by the military engineer Christian Lilly. Although supplied to the college, these were quite elaborate and later abandoned. �ere is now evidence from the SPG archive in Oxford that  an architect, by the name of John James, was engaged to pare back the design and produce new draw- ings, which were used to erect the building. See K. Jones, ‘“A college for the mission?” Codrington  College, Barbados (1710–1743)’, unpublished MA thesis (Courtauld Institute of Art, London, 2009).
 �is close connection between education and religion continued into the latter  part of the nineteenth century. As Iain Jackson and Ola Uduku observe in  Chapter 11, the missionary connection was strong in tropical West Africa espe- cially, with evangelical Anglican, Methodist, and Presbyterian societies all vying  with one another in erecting schools in places such as Sierra Leone, Gold Coast,  and Nigeria. Notions of ‘godliness and good learning’, wedded to concepts of  ‘muscular Christianity’, were in the ascendency throughout the British world,  owing in part at least to the Arnoldian reform of the English public school  system.77  Evidence of this can be found in the numerous faith-based schools established in  the settler dominions, including Church of England, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian,  and Methodist institutions.78 Even with the establishment of universities at around  the same time, which were non-religious foundations (like London and Edinburgh,  but unlike Oxford, Cambridge, and Trinity College, Dublin), we �nd a�liated  colleges of residence along denominational lines. �is is clear at the universities of  Toronto, Sydney, Melbourne, and Hong Kong, for instance, established between  the mid-nineteenth century and the early twentieth.79

 Institutions of this kind sought to establish in their own way pedagogical imper- atives the ultimate purpose of which was to inculcate Western values and ideals  into a native Asian elite, thus �tting this class for a life of leadership and service  within the empire. Indeed, as Peter Cunich has argued, Hong Kong University was  set up with the speci�c aim of helping create just such a class of graduates—drawn  from Hong Kong, the mainland, and nearby British territories—who could act,  among other things, as agents of British scienti�c, industrial, and economic expan- sion within the foreign spheres of in�uence of Imperial China.98
 If recent scholarship has implored us to consider that British imperialism was as  much a cultural phenomenon as it was a political and economic one, then both  religion and education were at the forefront of the endeavour to transplant  European values and ideas, as well as transform indigenous societies. More often  than not, religion and education went hand-in-hand in this process, especially up  until the end of the nineteenth century. Religious buildings, as the physical expres- sion of faith, were very important to early settlers in what would eventually become  Britain’s worldwide empire, and were often among the �rst buildings erected. �ey  were important primarily because they were fundamental to the identities of these  settlers, many of whom required emotional and spiritual strength and guidance 0 T.

 in leaving their homes and families to forge new lives abroad. Even for later waves  of colonists and missionaries, church architecture remained symbolic of this  undertaking.

 From the second half of the nineteenth century we see the profound ways in  which architecture and spatial planning were a�ected by both the Revolt and its  aftermath. Even while the British sought to segregate themselves increasingly from  Indians, the emergence of modern public institutions and shared spaces resulted in  the creation and expansion of what may be termed a ‘joint public realm’. Here,  statues and busts dedicated to Indian worthies would join those raised to British  ones. Distinct from both real and imagined ethnic, religious, and class enclaves,  this ‘joint public realm’ was a spatial arena that, in theory, was owned by and open  to all citizens which helped in the construction of an imagined common  public.4

 imposed a grid of streets on the limited �at land available at �orndon and Te Aro,  forming the armature for the modern city. In Auckland, however, the Colonial  Government’s Surveyor General, Felton Mathew, adopted the additional formality  of crescents and quadrants in an attempt to accommodate the undulating topog- raphy of the site, although with limited success. In order to revive its �agging for- tunes, the New Zealand Company’s later settlements were adapted to appeal to  speci�c groups of settlers and re�ected particular social, cultural, religious, and  even national identities. �us in Otago, established as a predominantly Free  Church of Scotland settlement, the names of Dunedin’s main streets perpetuated  those of Edinburgh; while in the Church of England settlement of Canterbury to  the north, Anglican associations were evoked by naming major streets in  Christchurch after English bishoprics, including, in a response to the global expan- sion of Anglicanism, Irish and colonial sees (see Plate 3). �e growing recognition  by mid-century of the need for cities to incorporate ample open space is also seen  in the reservation of extensive Town Belts, green spaces �anking the central areas  of Wellington and Dunedin.

 strong, ensuring that ecclesiological principles were in�uential well beyond New  Zealand.
 Ecclesiological ideals were also in�uential in Canterbury, founded in 1850  under the auspices of the Canterbury Association, whose President was the  Archbishop of Canterbury.9 Canterbury was intended as a model Church of  England settlement and was a clear expression of many of the most potent themes  of mid-century British culture: religious reform, idealistic immigration theory, and  the social critique implicit in Victorian medievalism. �e Gothic Revival in  Canterbury became the architectural embodiment of these ideals.0 From the out- set the Canterbury Association was intent on shaping the architectural develop- ment of the colony, commissioning a model design for a combined chapel, school,  and master’s house from William Butter�eld in 1849. George Gilbert Scott also  designed a timber church for Canterbury around 1850, although this, like  Butter�eld’s chapel school, remained unbuilt. �e dominant �gure in Canterbury 9 L. C.

 Initially, this was very much an unregulated and haphazard form of develop- ment, lacking any real sense of coherent planning, including sanitary provision,  until the later initiation of colonial town planning ordinances. Christian mis- sionary organizations—mainly but not exclusively the CMS, the Methodist and  Presbyterian missions—produced some of the largest structures in Sierra Leone,  Gold Coast, and Nigeria, largely in the form of churches, assembly halls, and  schools. �ese structures were basic in design, utilizing materials either locally  available or carried in ship ballast for construction. Later, structures would  include prefabricated iron kits imported from Glasgow or Liverpool.5 �e most  prominent schools were among those founded by the CMS, such as Fourah Bay  College (Sierra Leone, c.1900), and the British Colonial government’s advanced  secondary colleges, including Achimota College (Legon, Gold Coast, 1924), with  its campanile clock tower topped with a chateau-like roof, and King’s College,  Lagos (est. 1909)—both erected by the PWD. Missionary organizations were  also responsible for the founding of educational institutions in the Gold  Coast, at Mfantsipim (Methodist, 1876), and at Adisadel, Cape Coast (Anglican,  1910), and Akropong (buildings date from 1927), near Accra, with sparsely 5 �e most famous foundries in Glasgow were the Carron Company, Lion Foundry, and Walter  McFarlane’s Saracen Foundry.
 Roman Catholicism had long been present in the Holy Land; the Franciscans  even enjoyed the title ‘Keepers of the Holy Land’ owing to the number of build- ings they superintended. But Protestantism had little physical presence and, more  importantly, had no actual control over any monuments in the Holy Land.5 �e  sites and structures associated with the foundations of Christianity were controlled  by France and Italy, predominantly Catholic nations. In the mid-nineteenth cen- tury, Britain and Germany, the two great Protestant nations of Europe, founded a  joint bishopric in the Holy Land, which was to be based in Christ Church.  Possession of the bishopric was to have alternated between a German and a British  bishop, but with the deterioration in relations between Germany and Britain in  the 1880s, this was abandoned. �e Germans founded their own bishopric, located 5 �e importance of Gordon’s ‘discovery’ of the Garden Tomb is not so much whether the site is  actually Christ’s tomb or not, but that it was controlled by Protestants, as opposed to every other site  of religious signi�cance in Jerusalem, which was controlled by Catholics.

 3. It is important to recognize the links between the Anglican/Episcopal church and empire. As one historian has noted, “When all is said, the nearest thing the Empire had to a religion of its own . . . was the rite of the Anglican Church, diffused in such mysterious ways across the World” (James Morris, Heaven’s Command: An Imperial Progress, 334).
 The reference to Dulles’s Presbyterianism is helpful; it points to one tip of the iceberg of values Acheson’s criticism of Dulles reflected. In the hierarchy of social prejudices nurtured among the Anglican Ulstermen from whom Acheson descended, the largely working-class Scottish Pres- byteriansofUlster rankedonlymarginally above thegenerally lower-class Irish Catholics. In Acheson’s case, the disdain this nurturing encouraged had been reinforced by wealth and high status. Dulles thus represented a religious and social group Acheson had little cause to admire. In addition, Acheson believed that Dulles, as secretary of state in the Eisenhower administration, not only worked to dismantle major aspects of Acheson’s foreign policy, but also committed the cardinal sin of disloyalty to the British and French allies at Suez in 1956.

 This colonial pursuit of “Art” and “Science” that was the very opposite of  “cheap & mean” exposes some of the ideological, social, and po liti cal pa ram- e ters of intellectual culture in British America and beyond. Colden and  other imperial agents in New York played a constitutive role in the so- called  Moderate Enlightenment during the first half of the eigh teenth century.  The Moderate Enlightenment was a mainstream and state- sponsored fusion  of tradition, tolerant and reasonable religion, and new science and philoso- phy. It was typically reformist not revolutionary, and had its origins in the  religious and po liti cal turmoil of the seventeenth century. The Moderate  Enlightenment had an especially strong presence in Britain. Recoiling from  the po liti cal volatility of the 1640s and 1650s, En glish and Scottish governing  classes sought to establish an extended period of calm, order, industry, and  innovation after the Glorious Revolution (1688–1689). In the early eigh teenth  century, Newtonian natural philosophy, particularly as it was espoused by  latitudinarian clergymen, gave ideological support to this effort. It seemed  that a new era of stable politics and useful knowledge was indeed possible.
 The Revolution Settlement so clearly favored one religious and po liti cal  group that it left Scotland deeply unsettled for de cades. Sectarian conflict  continued into the 1690s as militant Presbyterians seized control of the  General Assembly of the Church and proceeded to dismantle Scottish   Episcopalianism. Visitation committees sought out “insufficient, negligent,  scandalous and erroneous ministers.”21 Six or seven hundred churchmen even- tually lost their posts either through the actions of these committees or at the  hands of rabbling mobs. Even though Scottish Episcopalians retained consid- erable religious and po liti cal clout, especially north of the Tay and among the  nobility, they suffered a severe blow as Presbyterians regained Scottish pulpits  that had been under Episcopalian control for de cades.22
 With his curiosity about the natural world ignited in this fashion, Colden  graduated from Edinburgh determined to become something other than a  clergyman. This resolve should not be confused with atheism. The minis- ter’s son retained a strong appreciation for established religion, which he con- sidered to be an essential component of a stable society. Accordingly, he  abandoned his Presbyterianism and joined the Anglican fold in America, a  common move for transplanted Scots involved in the imperial administra- tion. He confirmed his social and religious status by purchasing half a pew  in New York’s newly expanded Trinity Church in 1724, surely spending  many subsequent Sundays sitting there among the colonial elite. Later, in the  1740s, he gleefully speculated that his grandson, Peter DeLancey, then just  eight years old and from a wealthy family, might eventually become an Angli- can minister in America. Colden thought such a role was ideal for a colonial  gentleman and lamented that too few elites  were entering the clergy.58
 Separated by three thousand miles of ocean and most probably at a young  age, Elizabeth Hill and Janet Colden would have had limited contact. For  this reason, it seems likely that Hill abruptly sought out her Scottish relations  shortly before or after her husband’s death, with a view to bringing them  over to America to ease her widowhood. Such an occurrence would help to  explain why in 1708 the American Presbytery asked Colden’s father to as- sume the pulpit at Hill’s hometown of Lewes. Or ga nized Presbyterianism  was very much in its infancy in America at that moment. Just a handful of  churches existed along the mid- Atlantic coast, and the American presbytery  was itself no more than two years’ old. The securing of a pastor for Lewes,  where Presbyterians had lived since the 1690s, was one of its earliest orders  of business. In March 1708, the presbytery instructed one of its members,  the Reverend Francis Makemie, to invite “Mr. Alexander Coldin [Colden],  minister of Oxnam” to take on this role. Two months later Makemie re- ported back that he had completed this task.30 Nothing more was said of the  matter in the presbytery’s minutes, but it can be assumed that Rev. Colden  received the invitation and turned it down.
 Social and intellectual aspirations underpinned Franklin’s scheme. Like  Colden and many others in the eigh teenth century, Franklin took it for  granted that learned British gentlemen and aristocrats knew more and knew  better than the lower orders of society. Artisanal and folk knowledge  were  valued, but elite institutions such as the Royal Society of London assumed  ultimate authority for collecting and evaluating information. Colonials ac- cordingly made a set of social claims when they identified themselves as in- tellectuals. Colden had been carefully cultivating his genteel persona since  at least 1716, when he arrived in Philadelphia with a periwig and a plan to become a colonial physician. Franklin’s refinement was newer and less com- plete. The Philadelphian printer had just begun to shed his artisanal back- ground. It would take him another five years to retire from his craft and to  confirm his transition to gentility, a change he made without abandoning his  desire to advance the colonial and transatlantic circulation of knowledge,  and without fully embracing the aristocratic neo- Stoic ideals of Colden.31
 Colden’s eldest son, Alexander, became one of Newburgh’s most  important  mid- eighteenth- century leaders. Schooled there in Latin by an Anglican  missionary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, Alexander  Colden settled permanently in the town, bought up land, built a mill, estab- lished a ferry ser vice across the Hudson, and won election as a trustee of the  glebe. In 1751 he and fifteen others petitioned the governor for own er ship  of the glebe acres, where they planned to establish an Anglican church and employ a schoolmaster. A patent issued the following year formally cre- ated the Parish of Newburgh. Today an avenue called Colden Street runs  parallel to the river.48
 Episcopalianism was a rising cultural and po liti cal force in mid-  eighteenth- century New York. A majority of the colony’s French Hugue- nots, including James DeLancey, had switched to the Anglican Church by  the 1730s. Many members of the Dutch Reformed Church made a similar  transition by the 1740s.15 Trinity Church could no longer accommodate the  growing Anglican community, so another church was built. St. George’s  chapel was completed and consecrated in 1752. In confident mood, New  York’s Anglicans looked to found a university they could call their own.  Harvard, Yale, and the College of New Jersey (now Prince ton)  were either Congregationalist or Presbyterian institutions. The College of Pennsylvania  was for all intents and purposes nondenominational. The College of Wil- liam and Mary was Anglican, but far to the south. When a series of public  lotteries was held in New York to raise funds to support a university, Angli- cans pushed hard to create an Episcopalian establishment founded by royal  charter and capable of countering the republican tendencies of New En- gland, as well as the enthusiasm earlier spread by the revivals known as the  Great Awakening. They had influence in the Assembly; by one contempo- rary assessment, the House was filled entirely with Episcopalians, except for  “two Presbyterians and two or three corrupted Dutchmen and one En- glish.”16 Just as significantly, seven of the ten trustees appointed to or ga nize  the new college  were Anglican. Furthermore, in 1752, New York’s Trinity  Church donated land for the university.
 The Reflectors opposed the creation of a sectarian university. It was ru- mored that James Alexander was the “father” in charge of the protests, but  in reality Livingston led the movement.17 In six issues of the In de pen dent   Reflector, and with more polemic than politeness, he warned that bigoted  churchmen  were taking over the college and called for a nonsectarian uni- versity chartered by the provincial Assembly, not the Crown. Livingston’s  writings sparked a heated and extensive paper war. The Reverend William  Smith (a recently arrived Scottish Episcopalian unrelated to the New York  Smiths) published a response. Samuel Johnson also took a central role in the  dispute, initially as an adviser to the New York Anglicans, and later as the  first president of the new university, King’s College. He complained to  the Archbishop of Canterbury in June 1753 that the “Reflectors . . .  endeavor  to spirit up the people against us and to make it a sort of free thinking   latitudinarian seminary.”18 Anglican pressure shut down the In de pen dent  Reflection, but the Reflectors simply created another mouthpiece for their  views, the Occasional Reverberator (1753). A series of “Watch- Tower” articles  published in the New- York Mercury (1754–1755) additionally espoused the  position of the Reflectors, while Anglican arguments appeared in the New-  York Mercury and in a short- lived periodical, John En glishman: In Defence of  the En glish Constitution (1755). The  whole controversy came to an end when  the Assembly agreed to a compromise by which only half of the available  lottery funds  were granted to the college.

 Chapter 6 investigates the British colony in Morocco in the context of a rather neglected theme in the history of Britain’s presence overseas. Power projection here is regarded through the lens of, chiefly Protestant, churches and cemeteries. Leaving aside the issue of proselytising, the consolidation of British communities in the Near East and North Africa, as elsewhere, inevitably led to the need for Protestant churches and for cemeteries. Their well-being and their survival were often seen to mirror the fortunes of the British community, in terms of its identity, self-image and prosperity. This was particularly true as, by the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, British political and commercial ascendancy in Morocco had begun to wane. Long-standing British expatriates, many of whom were intimately connected with Protestant worship in the towns Introduction  xxv and cities of Morocco, generally guarded their religious observance jealously.  So too burial and memorialisation were important facets of identity, as well as  of status. The shifting political backdrop in Morocco, with the establishment of the French Protectorate from 1912 – which demonstrated starkly what could be achieved in Morocco, and, in a sense, what the British Government had forfeited – and then the transition to independence in 1956, highlighted the increasing marginalisation of the British community.
 The fragmentary evidence concerning worship and memorialisation among Britons in Morocco is illustrative of many of the issues that arose in this regard. The protection of such sacred spaces became highly charged, not least as they often appeared to symbolise the security of the British community. This was true concerning notions of the preservation and sharing of British values as well as commercial fortunes. Often, the Church of England struggled to project its influence in such places. Ambiguous and also shifting diocesan control tended to exacerbate existing concerns within expatriate communities about their future. Missions and missionaries were often called upon to furnish chaplains but it was common for such appointments to be seasonal and there was a recurring sense of spiritual needs, as well as missionary work, being neglected.95 The discussions that occurred of the shortcomings of some of those men appointed to minister to expatriates, seemed to reinforce a sense of unease relative to the colony’s prospects. Encroachments, whether of the physical variety, for example from the reconfiguration of public space, from the authorities in the French Protectorate or from the Moroccan authorities, had to be resisted as unwelcome intrusions into the old Morocco, in which Britain had been the dominant power. The Foreign Office and its representatives in Morocco were sometimes found wanting concerning the support offered in this context. Typically, issues bearing upon sacred space were dealt with at consular level but, so closely interwoven were they with the fabric of Britain’s power projection, that it was not uncommon for their discussion to raise questions about national prestige and the prestige of the Church of England, as the Established Church.

 In fact, the Trotters had wider involvement in missionary activity. In retirement, Lt. Col Henry Trotter served on the council of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. His grandfather was William Otter, Bishop of Chichester, an outspoken defender of the British and Foreign Bible Society. His half-sister, Lilias Trotter, was a celebrated missionary in North Africa, and his brother, the Archdeacon Edward Bush Trotter, took a keen interest in Anglican missionary work.79
 During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Foreign Office, and its personnel, in London and overseas, was manifestly and understandably more preoccupied with living rather than with deceased Britons. Historians of British foreign policy have also, in general, eschewed the church and the churchyard and related issues bearing upon sacred space, although, of course, discussion of the role of missionaries and their interaction with the Foreign Office has begun to increase.1 This chapter examines aspects of the relatively neglected subject of Foreign Office involvement in British graves located in British, European and international cemeteries in Morocco. It also considers issues that arose concerning Protestant Churches there and touches, briefly, on matters raised by the presence, from the mid-1870s, of various Protestant missions which were active in Morocco from that time.2 The chapter does not explicitly discuss, in detail, issues bearing upon war dead and the relatively small number of British servicemen who died in Morocco, its airspace or in its waters during the Second World War.3 Rather, it presents a case study of the interface of administrative and international history in peace time, and of the use and control of sacred space, and, to a lesser extent, of public space, against a changing political backdrop.4
 These fore-mentioned cemeteries had considerable importance for expatriate Britons: their preservation was frequently regarded as an issue of personal, as well as national, prestige. The April 1904 Entente Cordiale between Britain and France did not eviscerate official British interest in Morocco, but it did wane in varying degrees thereafter. The expatriate British population, which was often referred to, not least by itself, as the British ‘colony’ and later ‘community’ struggled against this trend. It also resisted the threatened cancellation of various capitulations which, from their inception in 1856, until their abandonment in 1937, were seen to embody British rights and interests in Morocco. So too,  in a sense, did the cemeteries, which, as the twentieth century progressed, were a constant reminder of the ‘old Morocco’, in which Britain had predominated in commercial and diplomatic terms. Their importance was accentuated by their location. In several cases, they stood next to places of worship, either in buildings which were readily identifiable as churches, such as St Andrew’s, Tangier, and St John the Evangelist, Casablanca, or buildings which had been consecrated for worship. Typically, these places of worship were overseen by committees, comprising leading expatriate Britons, which the local consul chaired. At Tangier, the church became closely intertwined with local expatriate politics and social hierarchies.12 These churches were central to expatriate life. As that existence came under threat, first from French political and commercial ascendancy, then from increasing levels of Moroccan administrative self-sufficiency, as well as from urban development, cemeteries attained increasing symbolic importance. However, as memories of old Morocco faded, and as the surviving British colony dwindled, and with it, funds to maintain the cemeteries, official support for their upkeep became more muted. In fact, for some time the attenuation of official support for expatriate Anglicans, had been apparent. From the mid-nineteenth century, if not before, financial constraints led the Bishop of London to derogate ministrations on the European Continent to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The latter body, as well as the Society for Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK), were also constrained by reductions in funding received from government.13
 Consular staff and diplomats, where present, were also at the heart of  the British colony. They were pivotal to local efforts to maintain patriotism and British values. In Tangier and in other Moroccan towns and cities, consuls also played a key role concerning churches and cemeteries. They were, for example, closely involved in fund-raising efforts and in discussions about the maintenance and upkeep of churches.14 They acted as a conduit for enquiries about graves from relatives of the deceased.15 At Tangier and at Casablanca, consuls sanctioned or vetoed alterations to headstones, a function which reveals a good deal  about the communities over which they presided. At the most basic level, consuls, as the enumerators of births, marriages and deaths within the British colony, recorded the key indication of its well-being. Often, they, and British diplomats, where present, led church services, played a leading part in church fund-raising and festivals, and made representations to the local authorities on church-related matters.16 They were also closely involved in efforts, in other areas of the colony’s life, to improve cohesion among its members, notably commerce.17 Soon  after the establishment of the French Protectorate in 1912, this was one further area in which the British colony began to feel increasingly insecure. The  striking development of French Morocco completely overshadowed correspon - ding developments involving Britons. Moreover, the construction of French Morocco and then of independent Morocco, often quite literally impinged upon these sacred spaces. At Casablanca, the Anglican Church of St John the Evangelist, built in 1906, and its cemetery, stood behind solid stone walls, and was rapidly surrounded and dwarfed by the new town, with the Place de France at its centre, and by a network of servicing roads, the expansion of which periodically threatened the cemetery’s continued existence. Thus, the church and cemetery, as with other British churches and cemeteries in Morocco, often appeared to echo the fate of the British colony.
 Mogador The Protestant cemetery at Mogador (Essaouira), where British merchants had sought to establish and expand their interests for some years, faced threats of a different kind.33 Consecrated in 1870, it served a small community of apparently largely transient Europeans and at some point, it was divided into Protestant and Catholic sections.34 Its upkeep and maintenance fell initially to European residents and then to the consular corps. Some of these residents attended Anglican services, which were led by the British consul or his nominee. Services were held in a building specially granted by the Sultan through the administrations of Sir John Hay Drummond-Hay, when minister to Morocco.35 Regular congregants expressed concerns about obtaining sufficient sums for the maintenance of the cemetery and church from expatriates, and bemoaned their neglect concerning pastoral provision. In July 1894, Robert Johnston, Vice-Consul at Mogador, wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, noting that since his arrival at  Mogador in 1878, he remained ignorant if the Moroccan coast was under the authority of any bishop. He considered that occasional visits by clergymen in search of health or en route to other countries, was insufficient and he suggested that members of the Church at other Moroccan ports would agree with this view. Johnston’s concerns were possibly heightened by the death of two of his children in the previous five years.36 The Archbishop’s Chaplain, Colin Campbell, provided limited reassurance in July 1894, as did the Bishop of Sierra Leone, in whose see the city then stood, and who visited Mogador in 1902.37 But these gestures did not fully assuage the sense of neglect, something which was amplified by concerns about attendance at services. In July 1902, Archibald Madden, who in 1900 had suggested the addition of an evening service, proposed to close the church from the early summer to late autumn as he needed a day off from his combined consular and pastoral functions. During that period, many of the congregation were absent.38 Here, as on the European Continent, the issue of Britons who chose to live abroad was not a priority.39
 Concern for the cemetery was also reflected in discussions that had occurred in 1927 for the appointment of a permanent chaplain and a furnished parsonage. Previously, chaplains were generally temporary appointments funded by the British colony, aided by the Colonial and Continental Church Society.64 This practice was disruptive, and so, in the summer of 1927, the church committee appointed Gerald Selous to chair a sub-committee to investigate the feasibility of a more permanent arrangement. Selous explained the broader purposes of the sub-committee when writing to the Earl of Selborne in June 1927, in order to request his involvement as honorary president of its campaign: ‘A well-chosen married Chaplain is a great power for good in this small British community, spiritually, socially, and educationally, for it would be expected of him to inculcate the British outlook into the British children here. . . .’65 Such an appointment could only strengthen British interests in Morocco at a time when the future of the capitulations was uncertain. Concerns about the Britishness of the colony, which had emerged before the First World War, and which continued during it, persisted. Elsewhere, Selous estimated the British colony at between six and seven hundred. Of these, however, only between one hundred and one hundred and fifty were Protestants.66 Furthermore, he calculated that there were merely thirty-eight English children, but a further eighty Gibraltarian and ninety-six Maltese children.67 As such, the chaplain’s role as educator was particularly important. As Selous explained to Lord Maclay, the shipping tycoon, and patron of the Southern Morocco Mission, when seeking his ‘moral and material support’ in July 1927, many English children attended French schools. Inevitably, they acquired a French outlook: it is evidently essential that British children should be convinced to the very core of their being that Britannia rules the waves and Wellington won the battle of Waterloo etc., etc. To be thoroughly British one must in childhood have absorbed the British doctrine.68
 When these discussions resumed in 1934, it was hoped that the Bible Churchmen’s Missionary Society (BCMS), whose mission had begun work in Morocco in 1931, would provide a permanent chaplain for St John’s. This duly occurred, with the appointment of Fred Morris, who remained in post until 1939. The appointment appeared to be relatively straightforward but the issue of his accommodation less so. As the society pointed out, if, as was being proposed, a parsonage or other accommodation were to be built in the church grounds, this would potentially afford the church control over the appointment.71
 The excitement provided by very large congregations of American soldiers, and various gifts bestowed by them, not least a beautiful oak pulpit from General George Patton, soon gave way to renewed concerns about the fabric of the church. As Cecil Green, who was officially Chaplain at St John’s since 1939,  but an assistant there from 1934, noted in August 1948, discussions about the acquisition of church ground by BCMS in order to construct a house for the bishop, had revived discontent among the British community towards the mission and at a public meeting the British community had, with one abstention, unanimously voted against the cession of land.74 Rented accommodation in Casablanca was extremely scarce. This became apparent in the case of the Rev. Philip Meldrum, and his wife, who had come to Casablanca, ostensibly on a temporary basis, with a view to assuming the chaplaincy for the small British community at Rabat. Alfred Houghton, BCMS’s General-Secretary, wrote to the Consul-General at Casablanca, at Meldrum’s request, in order to reserve for purchase a prefabricated house in the Quartier Bourgogne.75 Thus, in various ways the importance of St John’s as a symbol of Britain’s presence persisted. At a time of street protests and unrest in mid-July 1955, Cecil Green noted with amusement that the Sunday service was attended by only six people: a motley, if interesting group. While the service proceeded, the Church Secretary abstained, preferring to seek Divine guidance by mowing the Church lawn.76
 It was perhaps a good thing that he did so. Threats, of one kind or another, to the church persisted. By way of example, in 1975, a petition from businessmen prevented the removal of the Church and cemetery to make way for a new road.77 The association of British consuls at Casablanca with the Church Council ensured that such matters did not escape official notice. So too did Cecil Green’s long tenure as chaplain. In early 1981, Paddy de Courcy-Ireland, the Consul- General, and chair of the Church Council, wrote to Green’s colleague at BCMS Headquarters, the Rev. John Ball, to express his concerns about Green’s health and his future and also that of two of his colleagues who ran a clinic at Amizmiz.78
 Occasionally, the church fringed with high politics. At a time of heightened international sensitivities, in July 1912, and when regular church attendance within the British colony was dwindling, the minister at Tangier, Sir Ernest Satow, had sought advice as to how to respond to requests for the use of the church from German and French Protestants. The possibility that, one year, the church might be loaned to a French pastor but refused to a German might cause problems.85
 When making his case in 1936, Ellis had accentuated the official con  nection, arguing that Tangier was a diplomatic centre and was seen as such by other nation - alities. He further noted that the relationship between the Church of England  and the English Crown was well-known and that the prestige of the Church of England as a whole would decline if the connection was severed and the church handed to a missionary body. Ellis explained that the British Crown held the church yard in perpetual lease and the church had been built by private sub - scription.103 Indeed, upon the chaplaincy’s incorporation into the new bishopric its amended rules were signed by Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary, as well as by Cosmo Lang and by Bishop Wright.
 When confronted with such developments, members of St Andrew’s displayed a degree of determination as well as resistance to change. A case in point was their lukewarm attitude towards efforts, from the mid-1970s, to encourage ecumenical activity among the various churches in Tangier. Mary Bull, who was the People’s Warden and Ecumenical Secretary, was personally extremely dedicated to this task but there is a strong sense that relatively few of the regular congregants at St Andrew’s had any real interest in becoming personally involved in these initiatives.117 Indeed, Bull herself bemoaned the fact that St Andrew’s had gone ‘too high’, a view which she felt was shared by many other members.118
 Rabat The marked sensitivities surrounding St Andrew’s and its British-by-birth congregants, was apparently in stark contrast to the small British diplomatic community at Rabat during the late 1960s. As there was no suitable place for worship for Anglicans in Rabat, its members occasionally used the Chapel of the Little Sisters of the Assumption and were also offered accommodation in the French Cathedral Presbytery or in the Franciscan Friary.121 When Herbert Ward, Honorary Chaplain at the British Embassy, contemplated his retirement, he suggested that one of the friars of the Society of Saint Francis might replace him. Conceivably, also, because the settled British presence at Rabat was very limited, no objection was made to the removal of the remains of two Britons from the old European cemetery, Place de la France, Rabat to Cimitière de Khébibat in Rabat.122
 On a more general note, the chapter is illustrative of a still neglected facet of Britain’s presence overseas during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: expatriate communities. At a macro level, in certain places and at certain times, there is evidence to suggest that the Foreign Office and its representatives on the spot regarded them largely as a nuisance or did not actively seek to establish further British enclaves without the settled empire. Much more research is needed to expose the extent and nature of connections between expatriates and officialdom as well as the extent to which, collectively the strength and well- being of expatriates might be regarded as an indicator of national strength and well-being. One of the few individuals to articulate the view that they ought to be so regarded was Henry Knight, Bishop of Gibraltar (1911–20). Writing during the First World War, he noted that expatriates were in effect representatives of their country, embodiments of the Christian life of the Anglican Communion as well as of the national character. Moreover, he perceived British colonies  in his diocese as ‘avenues and channels of British trade’, where British capital  and interests were involved. As such, he argued that their religious and temporal interests ought not to be neglected.142

Clarendon had also expressed the view that chaplains must be carefully selected. It was essential that they should not seek to disrupt established arrangements in terms of existing chaplaincies or to proselytise.

 were in place. Similarly, “all landed and commercial transactions were now recognizably English.”50 During the eighteenth century, Ireland had its own parliament, suggesting a degree of autonomy. Yet, as Thomas Bartlett has pointed out, this was not unique to Ireland; at the time, representative institutions also existed elsewhere in the British Empire.51
 2 A “great body corporate” 1857 and the sinews of empire Within hours of receiving a request for assistance from the governor of Bombay, George Grey sprung to action. The Cape Colony governor immediately proposed the transfer of regiments, horses, artillery, and even money to support the British cause in India. In doing so, he claimed to be motivated by a sense of imperial responsibility. In moments of crisis, he explained to the Colonial Office, it was essential that all parts of the empire “simultaneously stir themselves to meet the emergency”; furthermore, he insisted, they needed to do so without first contacting London. The empire, after all, was more than a loose collection of isolated colonies. According to Grey, it was “a great body corporate” and each colony a “useful” member of the whole.1 Although one of the first to assist the British in India in 1857, Grey was not the only colonial administrator to do so; nor was he the only Briton to recognize the potential strength of a unified empire in which different colonies supported each other during moments of crisis. Throughout the empire, colonial officials and settlers scrambled to provide assistance for their kinsmen overseas.
 While press networks provided a crucial means of spreading news of the rebellion, other colonial connections often shaped reception. In par- ticular, familial connections ensured that the news reports would be read with interest throughout the empire. In 1857, it was not unusual for impe- rial participation to be a family affair. Many of the individuals famously associated with the suppression of the uprising – John Lawrence, Henry Havelock, and Frederick Sleigh Roberts – came from families with long military traditions. Some even had family members who were also serving in India in 1857 or stationed elsewhere in the empire. John Lawrence had two brothers, Henry and George, who were also noted for holding key military positions in India during the uprising. Similarly, the Graham family, originally from Ulster, had five family members in India when the rebellion began. These families of the empire were not restricted to the military; similar stories emerged within the empire’s missionary enterprise and among other colonists.
 The colonies respond The same connections that shaped individual reactions to the uprising also conditioned official and collective responses. Initially, colonial offi- cials and settlers relied heavily on imperial networks to generate support for the British project in India, and many scrambled to provide assis- tance. This flurry of support, however, quickly gave way to concerns. With time, and as the situation in India worsened, many in the colonies raised questions regarding colonial obligations. The following sections will examine these more formal contributions to British efforts overseas and the resulting questions regarding colonial responsibility and imperial unity.
 In preparation, the bishop circulated prayers to be included in service on three consecutive Sundays. Furthermore, he suggested to his fellow members of the clergy that they provide their congregations with “some brief explanation of what has been peculiar in the service for the day.” He warned, however, that the explanation should not be mistaken for an opportunity to dwell on the violence in India; when it came to “those 70 Dublin Evening Mail, October 7, 1857. Although many Protestants observed the day, some Irish nationalists mocked it. The Nation, for example, noted that the day of humiliation was “rather unnecessary” as the British had already experienced months of “humiliation” at the hands of the Indian sepoys. See Nation, October 3, 1857.
 When news of the uprising reached the colonies, the response was varied. Many individuals and colonial bodies responded immediately with offers of assistance. Others recommended transporting disbanded sepoys and suspected mutineers to new colonial locations. In each of these exam- ples, colonial officials and settlers debated both the colonial and imperial impact. Indeed, support for British efforts in India was rarely offered unconditionally; relief did not come without questions, debate, or even stipulations. When providing spiritual, military, or economic relief, indi- viduals and colonial bodies wanted recognition for their efforts. Further- more, many wanted assurance that the potential promise and strength of the “great body corporate” would also be there to assist them in their hour of need.
 While the idea that the Indian rebellion might represent the begin- ning of the end for the British appeared plausible in Ireland, it is more difficult to trace in other regions of the empire. Certainly, the empire witnessed an increasing number of indigenous and pan-tribal organi- zations, often developed as resistance measures against the British. In 1858, for example, Maori chiefs unified under the King Movement and selected the aged and hesitant warrior Potatau te Wherowhero as the Maori king.92 According to James Belich, the King Movement rep- resented an “unprecedented” show of pan-tribalism.93 Although the movement did not include all of Maoridom, it was an option for all Maori to join. This “very embryonic and incomplete sense of col- lective identity” can be traced in part to “a vague sense of shared unEuropeaness.”94 It cannot, however, be traced to the 1857 Indian rebellion. The King Movement had been taking shape throughout the 1850s and was proposed prior to the uprising in India. Even after the Indi- ans rebelled, I have found no direct evidence that the King Movement or any Maori unrest drew inspiration from the Indians or anyone else overseas.
 Furthermore, members of the press in New Zealand drew distinctions between colonized peoples and wrestled with efforts to “divide and rule,” mix regiments, and create a defense policy that both involved colonial people and reinforced British control. As in 1857, a number of different colonized people and possible solutions came under review. Although Wilson placed his faith in the Gurkhas, not everyone agreed that the Nepalese soldiers presented the best option. Major General H. Troup, one of Wilson’s most vocal opponents, had long advocated the use of Sikh troops. According to Troup, the Gurkhas were expensive, inferior soldiers, and prone to mutiny. The Sikhs, on the other hand, had “few prejudices, either religious or social,” and, “if properly treated,” could be “easily managed.” As a result, a Sikh would prove to be the better “man” and could benefit the colony as “either as a soldier or agriculturist.”73
 Similar calls for decisive action emerged elsewhere in the empire, and not just among people in positions of military or administrative power. Members of the armed services, the clergy, the colonial press, and indi- vidual colonists all pointed to the violence of 1857 as a legitimate reason to dispel potential unrest. As early as 1859, having received word of nationalist efforts in Belfast, James Graham wrote to his sister in Ire- land, “I cannot make out what your Belfast Phoenix Club people want; a landing of the American in Ireland to assist them in getting what!” While Graham seemed confused by the movement, he did not hesitate to suggest a response. “They ought to be put down with a strong arm. Give them [the authorities] a special commission as they did formerly, and hang not only all concerned but everyone that harbours them. They will then have met the just reward of their ingratitude.”124 Graham suggested that, like the sepoys in India, the nationalists in Ireland had expressed a lack of gratitude for British rule. And, fresh from suppressing the Indian rebellion, he recommended a similar “strong arm” response.
 In the end, colonial officials performed a balancing act. They openly acknowledged and rewarded “loyal” Maori leaders, but embraced force at the first signs of dissent. The Maori representatives remained a part of the colony’s political institutions; in fact, the number of Maori repre- sentatives increased during the early 1870s. As Bowen explained to the Colonial Office, it was “at once more politic and more humane to out- live the King Movement” than to “suppress it by the strong hand.” The colonists, he continued, needed to encourage “the turbulent natives” to “live peaceably.” The strong hand, however, would still come out when- ever necessary. “[M]urderous onslaughts whether on the Europeans or on the friendly Maori,” he explained, “should be punished with the rigour necessary to prevent a recurrence of unprovoked aggressions.”73 Hand in hand, these methods sought the same outcomes: to ensure Maori loy- alty and reinforce British authority. Force provided a means to establish power, and political institutions provided a method to maintain control.

 As I studied the archives from the 1960s, it seemed to me that the  neglected dimension of decolonization lay in the transformation of  international society at the United Nations.74 In 1968, Conor Cruise  O ’Brien analysed the changing personality of the United Nations by  showing how it had come to foster multiculturalism, multiracialism,  and decolonization as well as peace.75 The moral authority of the  United Nations endowed it with a charisma and a quasi-religious qual­ ity—with Dag Hammarskjöld as the secular Pope on the East River—  and the new priorities in Turtle Bay took on an air that was at once sa­ cred and chic. To those within the British government following these  ideological developments, the consequences for the British colonies  were dangerous because they were irrational yet compelling. Never­ theless, the British public, on the whole, still believed that the United  Nations symbolized the hope of humankind.
 The smallest of the colonial empires in the twentieth century  was the Spanish. The loss in 1898 of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Phil­ ippines to the United States, and the Pacific islands to Germany,  reduced the Spanish empire mainly to the Canary Islands, Spanish Sa­ hara, a protectorate in part of Morocco, and Spanish Guinea in Equa­ torial Africa (the only colony of any economic value, mainly in cocoa).  The tradition of the old Spanish colonial system nevertheless proved  to be significant It was authoritarian, legalistic, and paternalistic—  the forerunner of the twentieth-century colonial regimes. Of the last­ ing Spanish legacies, perhaps the most remarkable was the assimila­ tion of the Filipinos to Catholicism and the Spanish way of life. The  effective colonizers were not the Spanish sea captains and conquista­ dors but the friars and monks who built churches and created parishes  and schools. The class structure of the Spanish era remained intact,  and the system of patronage continued into the era of independence.
 was a solution to which some Congo reformers never agreed.84 It was  a  conditional solution, to be accepted only if Belgium would promise  to  abolish the Leopoldian system and to administer the Congo in the  'spirit as well as the letter’ of the Berlin Act.85 It was, above all, an ex­ pedient, an excellent way to prove that the Congo reform movement  was not motivated by territorial or commercial greed.
