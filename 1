Recently, economic historians　have presented evidence from England showing that the dramatic reversal in distributional trends --　from a steep secular fall in wage-land rent ratios before 1800 to a steep secular rise thereafter -- must　be explained both by industrial revolutionary growth forces and by global forces that opened up the　English economy to international trade. This paper explores whether and how the relationship was　different for Spain, a country which had relatively poor productivity growth in agriculture and low　living standards prior to 1800, was a late-comer to industrialization afterwards, and adopted very restrictive　policies towards imports for much of the 19th century. The failure of Spanish wage-rental ratios to　undergo a sustained rise after 1840 can be attributed to the delayed fall in relative agricultural prices　(due to those protective policies) and to the decline in Spanish manufacturing productivity after 1898.　Joan R.

Growth and Distribution: How Was Spain Different?　A large literature has emerged over the past fifteen years in which economic　theorists (Goodfriend and McDermott 1995; Hansen and Prescott 2002; Lucas 1999,　2002; Galor and Weil 2000; Jones 2001; Doepke 2004; Cervellati and Sunde 2005;　O’Rourke, Rahman and Taylor 2007) have attempted to model the dramatic structural　break in European living standards which occurred at some point between 1750 and　1850. Real wages and labor productivity were relatively stagnant before the late 18th　century, when it appears that both depended positively on land-labor ratios and when　population growth depended positively on real wages, all of which is consistent with the　famous model offered by Thomas Malthus (1826). After 1850, real wages and labor　productivity enjoyed a sustained and impressive increase that continues to this day,　experience clearly inconsistent with Malthusian thinking since population has continued　to increase, and at a faster rate. The prevailing view is that the industrial revolution must　have been responsible for the abrupt secular change in these productivity trends.　However, a recent paper by two of the present authors (O’Rourke and Williamson　2005) exploited new data documenting relative factor price trends over the very long run,　and pointed out that there was another, equally dramatic change in income distribution　trends which occurred in northwest Europe at about the same time. Prior to the 19th　century, there had been a long epoch during which the wage-land rent ratio declined,　implying a rise in inequality (since land owners were at the top of the income distribution　while landless laborers were at the bottom: Hoffman et al. 2002). This trend is consistent　with a Malthusian world in which an increasing population pressed on a fixed 　4　endowment of land, to the benefit of landlords. At some point in the 19th century this　pattern reversed dramatically in England, the Lowlands and the rest of northwest Europe:　wages started to rise relative to land rents, implying a decline in inequality. This more　modern trend is inconsistent with a Malthusian world in which wage-rent ratios were　determined by the land endowment per worker, since the land-labor ratio continued to　decline over the two centuries following 1800.　In short, the ancient link between factor prices and factor endowments was broken　in the early 19th century, at least in northwest Europe. What explains the break? One　obvious explanation is that it was caused by the same industrial revolutionary forces　underlying the break in living standards and labor productivity trends. While not　everyone agrees on the exact timing, all scholars agree that the rate of technological　advance accelerated in English industry about this time (Clark 2007; Crafts and Harley　1992; Mokyr 1990, 2002, 2005). In a specific factors model in which two commodities　are produced – agricultural products (using land and labor) and manufactured goods　(using capital and labor), productivity advance and accumulation in English industry　should have drawn workers out of agriculture and into the cities, raising wages, lowering　agricultural land rents, and inflating the ratio of the two.　 These industrial revolutionary forces are the focus of the theoretical papers cited　earlier, and they were certainly important in explaining the reversal in distributional　trends as well. However, that reversal can also be explained by an epochal change in the　world economy that coincided with the Industrial Revolution: Europe became　dramatically more open to trade in the decades following the French Wars (O’Rourke and　Williamson 1999, 2002a, 2002b; Findlay and O’Rourke 2007). Only in the 19th century 　5　did intercontinental trade have its effects on commodity and factor price convergence　which was the focus of those two famous Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher and Bertil　Ohlin (Flam and Flanders 1991). Thus, global market integration helped cut the links　between domestic factor prices and domestic land-labor ratios. For England at least,　globalization and the industrial revolution made equally important contributions to the　dramatic change in secular distribution trends (O’Rourke and Williamson 2005).　 But what about other parts of Europe where the industrial revolution came late,　where the modern commitment to free trade was less passionate, and where modern proglobal transport revolutions might have been more modest? And what about those parts　of Europe where productivity growth and population increase were both slower in the　pre-modern, closed-economy era? In this paper, we ask whether wage-rent ratios behaved　the same way in Spain as in England and the rest of northwest Europe between 1500 and　1913, and whether industrialization and global forces played the same roles there as they　did in the leading European economies. Given that Spain and the rest of the European　periphery were much more protectionist than the industrial core, we expect to find a less　dramatic rise in the wage-rental ratio and we expect that trade policy played a big role in　accounting for the difference.　 We use the specific factors trade model (Jones 1971), with exogenous　endowments and technology, to explore Spanish experience in a comparative context.　Section 2 reviews just how Spain differed from England and the rest of northwest Europe　in terms of globalization experience and productivity performance in the very long run.　Section 3 documents Spanish relative commodity and factor price experience over the　four centuries before 1913, and compares it with England and Holland. Section 4 exploits 　6　the price dual to extract estimates of Spanish total factor productivity growth in both　agriculture and industry. It also compares these new (quantitative) estimates with the　traditional literature, based as they are on older, more qualitative evidence, especially for　the pre-1800 period. Section 5 explores the determinants of relative commodity and　factor prices before and after the early 19th century transition, sorting out the influence of　domestic endowments, domestic productivity and global forces. Section 6 explores some　counterfactuals that allow us to make explicit comparisons between Spain and England.　Section 7 concludes.　2. Globalization and Productivity Growth: Spain versus Northwest Europe　since 1500　Going Global: Comparing Spain with the Leaders　An extensive literature now documents clearly the timing and importance of the　first global century, the 19th century. It is not our purpose to review this evidence in　detail, but only to show that while Spain was certainly part of that global century, there　were powerful anti-global forces at work there that made a difference. Where countries　had liberal attitudes toward trade, commodity prices converged between trading markets　as global market integration took place (O’Rourke and Williamson 1999, 2002a) and　world trade boomed (O’Rourke and Williamson 2002c, Estevadeordal et al. 2003).　Furthermore, there was nothing like this move towards world market integration between　1500 and 1800, an era of discovery and enterprise without liberal trade policy and cheap 　7　transport. The economic leaders in the Atlantic economy – Great Britain and Holland –　were, of course, central actors in this globalization drama.　The mainstream literature divides Spanish foreign trade experience since　Columbus in to three periods. Up to the 1820s, American domestic and re-export trade　had an important impact on total Spanish trade. The loss of the colonies introduced a　short but difficult period of adjustment from the 1820s to the 1840s when Spanish trade　contracted dramatically as it struggled to shift from American to European markets.　During the century and a half after the 1840s, Spain underwent an impressive increase in　trade.　In the first period, the Spanish traded goods sector shrank: many commodities in　which Spain was once self-sufficient -- such as corn, rice, and sugar -- became imports;　and even those goods Spain previously exported -- such as leather manufactures, iron,　and alum -- began to be imported by the early 17th century. Mauricio Drelichman (2005)　attributes this collapse in traded goods sectors to a Dutch disease caused by the massive　influx of precious metals from America. Spanish monarchs developed a series of　mercantilist policies to control their returns on this trade: several privileged trade　monopolies were established, only a few ports were allowed to participate in the　American trade, and most of it remained in hands of merchants in Cadiz. While a very　large share of Spanish exports to America were European re-exports, Spain also exported　wool, spirits, wine, raisins and other primary products to Europe and imported cotton　yarn, linen and wool textiles and flour in return (Prados de la Escosura 1988). Restrictive　mercantilist trade policies were reinforced by wartime disruptions at the end of the 18th　century (Findlay and O’Rourke 2007: Chp. 7): total exports declined by one third from 　8　1784 to 1820. Spanish foreign trade did not grow again until the 1840s. Thereafter,　Spanish exports grew at rates similar to the rest of Europe (Prados de la Escosura 1988:　183). As in earlier centuries, 19th century Spain mainly exported food, raw materials and　semi-finished goods and imported raw materials and manufactures (Prados de Escosura　1988: Table 5.5). About 60 percent of Spanish trade involved Western Europe, Britain　and France being the major trading partners (Tena 2005: Table 8.7).　Was the evolution of Spanish trade policy different? Not on the basis of the pre1800 anti-global policies just summarized, since they were common throughout Europe.　Yet, Spain went global with much less enthusiasm during the first global century up to　1913. Consider trade shares: for the UK, the share of exports and imports in GDP rose　from 52 to 55% over the 55 years between 1855-59 and 1910-14 (Mitchell 1988: 453,　836); for Spain, the trade share also rose, from 7.9 to 21.3% over the sixty years between　1850-54 and 1910-14 (Tena 2005: Table 8.8). While trade boomed in both countries,　Spain was clearly much less open than Britain, in the sense that it had much lower trade　shares. And while Spanish commercial policy got increasingly liberal across the late 19th　century -- the average tariff rate fell from 14.9% in 1865 to 8.2% in 1913 (Williamson　2006b), it was still much more protectionist than free trade Britain.　The big difference between free trade Britain and protectionist Spain lay with　agriculture and the grain trade. The Spanish government imposed an embargo on grain　imports in 1802, and it was used many times up to 1869, after which protection of local　wheat producers was achieved instead by relatively high tariffs (Montañés 2006). In　contrast, over the same period Britain removed its embargo soon after the French Wars,　reduced the tariff on grain over the two decades prior to Corn Law Repeal in 1846, and 　9　then stuck to free trade thereafter. As we shall see, this difference in policy had a very big　impact on trends in the relative price of agricultural products in 19th century Spain and　Britain (Figure 10).　When Did They Go Global?　Let us start with the leader. Were English commodity prices more closely linked　to English endowments prior to the 19th century? And if so, when did this traditional,　closed economy relationship break down? A previous paper explored the question of　when the structural break took place (O’Rourke and Williamson 2005: Figure 6): it　assumed a simple relationship between relative commodity prices (agricultural vs　manufacturing) and the land-labor ratio, and plotted Chow test statistics for every year　between 1502 and 1935 to see where a structural break in this relationship was most　likely to have taken place. There was a slow, hardly noticeable rise in the test statistic　between 1500 and 1700, followed by a significant rise from 1700 to 1750, and a larger　rise from 1750 to 1800. This timing coincides well with what we know about the gradual　opening of the English economy to international trade during the course of the 18th　century. While the Chow tests suggested that traditional links between relative　commodity prices and endowments were already breaking down during the 18th century,　the sharpest acceleration in the test statistic occurred between about 1800 and 1840. The　best candidate for a structural break was the second quarter of the 19th century, with the　peak in the series occurring in 1838. Strikingly, this 1838 peak is very similar to the　timing of decline in both the Atlantic freight index (Harley 1988: Figure 1) and the grain　price gap between the US and Britain (O’Rourke and Williamson 2005: Figure 3). 　10　Furthermore, it is consistent with qualitative accounts regarding the liberalization of　British trade policy which have long been a staple in the economic history literature. That　is, prior to 1828, grain imports were prohibited if domestic prices fell below a certain　‘port-closing’ level, and during the early postwar years grain imports were effectively　excluded much of the time. In 1828, the Duke of Wellington’s government replaced these　import restrictions with tariffs which varied with the domestic price, a policy that not　only lowered British grain prices but also increased the integration of British with　Continental grain markets. Moreover, this adoption of the sliding scale tariff came when　several other moves towards freer trade were in motion: a reform of the Navigation Acts　in 1822; tariff reductions across the board; and the repeal of more than 1,100 tariff acts in　1825. Of course, prior to 1815 the French Wars had severely restricted international trade　(O’Rourke 2006). In short, by 1838 there had already been a radical liberalization of　British commercial policy (Williamson 1990), and Britain stuck with that proglobalization policy stance up to the more famous 1846 Repeal of the Corn Laws and　beyond.　 Was Spanish pro-global experience any different? Let us begin by exploring the　same Chow test statistic that emerges from the simple closed economy regression, as in　the British case. In order to see if the answers we obtain depend on the specification of　this regression, we provide four versions. The first is the specification given in equation　(4) of Table 1 below, in which relative commodity prices are regressed not just on the　land-labor ratio, but on total factor productivity in agriculture and manufacturing, as well　as on a time trend, with an AR(1) term added as well to correct for serial correlation. The　second excludes the time trend and AR(1) correction; the third further excludes TFP in 　11　manufacturing (so that relative commodity prices are taken to be a function of the landlabor ratio and agricultural TFP alone); and the fourth lets relative commodity prices　depend solely on the land-labor ratio, as in previous work on England. All variables are　expressed in logs. Figure 1 plots the Chow test statistics for every year. In each of the　four cases, the Chow statistic rises slowly over the two centuries before 1800, and then　leaps dramatically upwards after 1800 or so. The large Chow statistics peak in the late　1840s and early 1850s, a little later than Britain. In what follows, we will take 1840 as a　benchmark year after which an open economy specification is more appropriate for the　Spanish economy, but Figure 2 shows clearly that it was a long transition.　Thus, Spain underwent very much the same kind of pro-global transition as did　the European leader, or at least so say the statistics. As Leandro Prados de la Escosura　(1988) points out, however, the 19th century trade boom was not without slumps.　Furthermore, we have already seen that trade shares were much lower in Spain and tariffs　much higher. A break in the Spanish export series is clearly observable after the 1830s　and 1840s (as Spain struggled with the loss of her American colonies), two decades　during which they grew at a rate half of those typical of Europe. Over the half century　1853-1899, exports accelerated and grew at rates (3.3 percent per year) that exceeded　those in Europe. Finally, between 1899 and 1913 trade growth fell below the European　average, partly as a consequence of the loss of the Cuban, Puerto Rican and Philippine　colonies in 1898, and partly as a consequence of rising protection, domestic regulation,　and diminished competitiveness. In short, while Spain was clearly less pro-global than　Britain, its transition to openness followed much the same timing as Britain, except that　Spain underwent a late 19th century anti-global backlash which Britain did not. 　12　What about Comparative Productivity Performance?　Section 4 will estimate total factor productivity for Spanish agriculture and　industry over the very long run. Here we ask what the traditional literature tells us so that　later we can gauge our estimates against that standard .　 With the exception of late 19th century agriculture and industry, estimates of　Spanish sectoral total factor productivity growth are relatively scarce. However, the　qualitative literature argues that productivity advance in these two sectors was limited, or　even negative, from the 16th to the 19th century. The mainstream view is that an absence　of technological change was produced by anti-growth institutions and ecological　constraints. While the Spanish economy only underwent extensive, as opposed to　intensive, growth during the 16th century, even that was followed by a dramatic decline in　the 17th century, before an 18th century recovery. On net, therefore, the standard view is　that very little, if any, productivity growth took place in Spain across the three centuries,　while there was significant productivity growth in Britain.　A lively debate has emerged regarding the evolution of agricultural total factor　productivity over the long 19th century. Employing controversial and scarce quantitative　evidence, Jaume Vicens Vives (1977) was the first to assert that land productivity　stagnated over the century, thus delaying Spanish economic development. Nicolás　Sánchez-Albornoz (1977), Jordi Nadal (1974) and other economic historians supported　this pessimist argument emphasizing the absence of technological innovation. Several　authors have also emphasized the ecological limits to Spanish agricultural development　due to limited (and uncertain) rainfall and poor soil (Huguet del Villar 1969; Tortella　1981, 1994). 　13　 In the 1980s, a new generation of economic historians began to express some　doubts about this pessimist view of the 19th century. The GEHR (1983, 1989) concluded　that a notable increase in productivity took place between 1891/95 and 1931, while　Ramón Garrabou and Jesús Sanz (1985) estimated that cereal productivity grew by 57　percent from 1800 to 1895. More recently, Prados de la Escosura (1988, 1989) estimated　that labor productivity grew at 0.4 percent per year from 1800 to 1910, while land　productivity grew between 0.2 and 0.6 percent per year. Thus, he concluded that　agricultural output grew decidedly faster than population over the 19th century, although　less than in other European countries. James Simpson (1989, 1995) is more pessimistic,　arguing that agricultural output only grew a bit faster than Spanish population, and that　significant technological change had to wait for the second half of the 20th century.　Finally, Bringas Gutierrez (2000) has employed both the primal and the dual TFP　measures, concluding that productivity advance in Spanish agriculture from 1800 to 1905　was 0.49 percent per year, although his estimates suggest that a large part of this progress　was concentrated in the last third of the century.　 Comparative studies underline the relative backwardness of Spanish agriculture.　Recent work by Robert Allen (2000) has found that Spanish relative agricultural labor　productivity declined between 1500 and 1800: in 1500, Spanish labor productivity was　89 percent of England, while it was 70 percent in 1800. Allen concludes that Spain　missed the agricultural revolution. The situation had not changed much by the end of the　19th century: Spanish labor productivity was 62 percent of Britain in 1890 and 68 percent　in 1910 (O’Brien and Prados de la Escosura 1992). 　14　 Opinions about the evolution of Spanish industrial productivity can also be　divided into optimists and pessimists, and, like agriculture, the debate is also plagued by　the absence of quantitative evidence. Nadal (1974) has forcefully argued for a rapid　productivity advance over the 19th century. More recently, Albert Carreras (1990)　advanced a similar view stressing the importance of progress during the 1830-1860　period. Pessimists have sharply challenged this view (Tortella 1994; Prados de la　Escosura 1988; Fraile Balbín 1991), stressing instead the relative backwardness of　Spanish industry.　3. Relative Commodity and Factor Prices: Spain versus Northwest Europe　since 1500　 Figure 2 reports secular income distribution trends as measured by the ratio of the　wage to land rent (w/r: 1900=100). The experience between 1568 and 1913 is plotted for　three countries, two economic leaders in the European northwest – England and Holland　– on the one hand, and Spain, on the other.1　 The difference between them is striking.　The first notable difference is in their secular trends before the modern era. The　northwest underwent a great secular fall in w/r, or equivalently a great secular rise in　inequality over the 300 years between the mid-16th century and the mid-19th century.　True, the spectacular fall in the English w/r up to the early-17th century was not quite so　dramatic in Holland, and the latter underwent a partial rebound in the first half of the 18th　century which England did not share. Still, the big secular fall in w/r over the 300 years　before the mid-19th century was common to both: in England, it fell by 76% between　　1　 While the Spanish series in Figure 2 may appear to be more volatile, this is simply because the w/r data　for Spain are reported by year, while the data for England and Holland are averaged over longer periods.　See Appendix 1 and 2. 　15　1568-1588 and 1848-1868, while in Holland it fell by 57% over the same three centuries.　It fell by only 9% in Spain over the same period, or hardly at all. Up to the mid-19th　century, the European northwest underwent an impressive rise in inequality favoring the　landed rich while Spain did not.　The second notable difference between Spain and the northwest lies with the　modern era of globalization and industrial revolutions. Industrially-leading northwest　Europe underwent a complete reversal in distribution trends after the mid-19th century,　recording an egalitarian rise in w/r up to 1913 (and beyond). Spain did not. Whatever it　gained between mid-century and the 1880s, it lost from then to 1913. While there is　volatility in the Spanish w/r series 1850-1913, there is none of the secular trend reversal　we see in northwest Europe, or at least if there was, then it was sharply reversed in the　1880s.　Figure 3 reports secular trends in the price ratio of agricultural to industrial　products (PA/PM: 1750=100), using annual data wherever possible (the English data are　however decadal up to the early 19th century, which explains why they are smoother than　the other series). Figure 4 presents smoothed versions of these three series, generated　using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, with a smoothing parameter of 300. England underwent　a steady and impressive rise in the relative price of farm products (alternatively, a fall in　the relative price of manufactures), recording about a tripling in PA/PM over the three　centuries before 1800. The relative price of farm products also rose in Holland over the　same period, although the magnitude of the increase was somewhat smaller, less than a　doubling. There was also an increase in Spain between 1500 and 1800, although the long　swings in relative prices were so pronounced there that it is hard to be sure that this was 　16　in fact a trend. In both Spain and Holland there was an increase for the first century or so,　followed by a decline, and then another rise during the 18th century. Relative agricultural　goods prices seem to have fallen sharply during the Napoleonic Wars in both Spain and　the Netherlands, which can presumably be attributed to the trade-destroying effects of　that conflict making manufactures scarcer on the Continent (O’Rourke 2006). By the　middle of the 19th century, relative commodity prices were stabilizing in all three　countries, with declines in relative food prices in the Netherlands after the 1850s or so, in　Spain after the 1880s, and (less obviously) in England after the 1840s, declines which　might plausibly be attributed to the effects of declining transoceanic freight rates.　However, in the Spanish case this eventual decline was preceded by several decades of　rising relative food prices, which might perhaps reflect the somewhat later integration of　Spanish markets with those of the rest of the world.　4. Estimating Spanish Productivity Advance 1568-1913 from the Price Dual　Using the Price Dual to Infer Productivity Trends　 In order to assess the impact of Industrial Revolutionary forces on Spanish factor　prices, we need some measure of industrial technological progress. Moreover, since　Spain was primarily an agricultural economy for all but the very end of our period, we　also need a measure of technological progress in agriculture if we want to explain trends　in income distribution. To obtain such a measure, economic historians typically estimate　total factor productivity growth, or the share of output growth not explained by the　growth in factor inputs. In order to compute this, one needs data on such inputs as capital 　17　stocks, which are increasingly difficult to obtain the further back in history we reach.　Fortunately, price data offer an alternative called the dual (for a recent example, see　Antràs and Voth 2003): total factor productivity can be calculated as the rate at which　output prices decline relative to an appropriately weighted average of factor input prices.　Since there exist relatively abundant factor and commodity price data for early modern　Spain, we can calculate total factor productivity back to the late 16th century, for both　agriculture and manufacturing.　 More formally, let　(1) Y = A F(K, L)　where Y is output, K and L are inputs of capital and labor respectively, and A is a measure　of total factor productivity. If payments to capital and labor exhaust output, then it is a　straightforward to show that　(2) ΔA = ΔY - ηK ΔK - ηL ΔL　where Δ indicates growth rates, and the ηi are the shares of income going to factor i.　Alternatively,　(3) ΔA = ηK Δr + ηL Δw - ΔP　where r represents real profits, and w is real wages. Equation (2) is the usual (primal)　expression for the Solow residual or TFP growth: the difference between the growth rate　of output and a weighted sum of the growth rates of factor inputs, with the weights being　the shares of each input in total output. Equation (3) is our dual measure of total factor　productivity growth: the difference between the growth in (value added) output prices　and the weighted sum of the growth rates of real factor prices. 　18　 For agriculture, we take the two inputs to be labor and land. We have combined　these using a Divisia Index, weighting land rents and agrarian wages by 0.35 and 0.65　respectively. Data on rents came from a variety of sources (see Appendix). In order to　generate a national series we have weighted each regional rent series by the share of that　region in total cultivated land.　 Our manufacturing TFP series is based on the textile industry, the most important　manufacturing activity during the period. The first step was to obtain a Divisia Index of　value added, as opposed to gross output, prices. This was done by subtracting the growth　rate of intermediate input prices from the growth rate of textile prices, with a weight for　intermediate inputs of 0.35. As for factor prices, we have only used textile wages (with a　weight of 0.65 in value added) up to 1850. Therefore, we implicitly assume that profits　were constant over this early period. For the period after 1850, however, we have　combined data on wages (with a weight of 0.65 in value added) and data on interest rates　(with a weight of 0.35) using a Divisia price index.　 The first panel of Figure 5 shows the evolution of TFP in Spanish agriculture　from 1568 to 1913. The figure appears to correspond closely with the pessimistic view of　Spanish agriculture surveyed in Section 2. Four periods are clear: (1) an initial　contraction that lasted up to 1650; (2) a subsequent period of expansion over the　following eighty years (1650-1730); (3) a second contraction that lasted up to the end of　Napoleonic Wars; and (4), finally, a moderate 19th century expansion of TFP.　Productivity gains in agriculture seem inversely related to the expansion of Spanish　population up to the 19th century, perhaps indicating that when population grew, marginal　and less productive land was exploited. 　19　 The second panel of Figure 5 documents the evolution of TFP in Spanish textiles　from 1568 to 1913. Once again, the figure corresponds quite closely with the qualitative　accounts of the Spanish economy reviewed in Section 2. The rate of growth of TFP in　textiles was moderate up to the early 18th century, after which it experienced a slow　acceleration, particularly during the second half of the 18th century. TFP stagnated during　the turbulent first third of the 19th century, but then it increased dramatically as a　consequence of the arrival of British machinery and the adoption of the factory system　(Rosés 1998). After the cotton famine of the 1860s, textiles experienced a second phase　of dramatic TFP growth before it was choked off by a crisis produced by the loss of　colonial markets and consequent excess capacity.　5. What Determined Spanish Commodity and Factor Price Trends 1580-1913?　 If sustained global commodity market integration only began in the 19th century,　then it follows that while the distributional implications of international trade should not　have been manifested in the centuries before, they should have afterwards. This　hypothesis has been successfully tested using English factor endowments, commodity　prices, productivity and factor prices from 1500 to 1936 (O’Rourke and Williamson　2005). Now we want to do the same for Spain. To do so, we have constructed time series　1580-1913 for land-labor ratios (LANDLAB, agricultural land in hectares divided by　population), the ratio of agricultural prices to industrial prices (PAPM), the ratio of daily　wage rates to farm land rents per hectare (WAGERENT), total factor productivity in　agriculture (TFPAG), and total factor productivity in manufacturing (TFPMAN). The 　20　sources of the total factor productivity data have already been discussed in the previous　section, while the rest can be found in Appendix 2. Figures 6 and 7 present these five　series as they are entered into the regressions below, that is in logarithmic form.　　What Determined Spanish Commodity and Factor Price Trends Prior to 1800?　 For the closed economy between 1580 and 1800, Table 1 estimates a simple loglinear OLS regression2　 of PAPM on land-labor ratios, TFP in agriculture, and TFP in　manufacturing, Since LANDLAB is trend stationary, we include a time trend in all　regressions. All coefficients have the signs that economic theory suggest they should, and　typically have very high t-statistics: whenever there was population pressure on the land,　it raised the relative price of farm products (the elasticity of PAPM with respect to the　land-labor ratio ranges from -0.7 to -0.9); whenever there were improvements in　agricultural total factor productivity, it lowered that relative price (the elasticity of PAPM　with respect to TFPAG lies between -1.2 and -1.3); and whenever there were　improvements in manufacturing total factor productivity, it raised that relative price (the　elasticity of PAPM with respect to TFPMAN lies between 0.8 and 0.9).　 In equation (1) we just include the land-labor ratio on the right hand side of the　regression, and here the coefficient on the land-labor ratio is statistically significant at　conventional levels. However, when an AR(1) correction is included in equation 2, as the　Durbin-Watson statistic suggests it should be, the coefficient on the land-labor ratio　becomes statistically insignificant. Part of the reason for this may be seen in Figure 6.　Over the first 150 years or so, the land-labor ratio and PAPM appear to rise and fall　　2　 Ordinary Least Squares is acceptable since logPAPM, logTFPAG, logTFPMAN and logWAGERENT　are all stationary, while logLANDLAB is trend-stationary. 　21　together, whereas they should be negatively related, ceteris paribus. In order to explain　this apparent anomaly, we need to appeal to other factors, such as movements in total　factor productivity in agriculture. Agricultural TFP declined and then rose over these first　150 years, which may explain the initial rise and then fall of PAPM. When TFPAG is　included in the regression, the coefficient on land-labor ratios becomes statistically　significant regardless of whether we correct for serial correlation (equation 3) or not　(equation 4). Equation (4) is our preferred specification. Note that the R2　 is 0.97,　suggesting that the closed economy model works very well, and that exogenous world　market conditions had little influence on PA/PM over those three pre-modern centuries.　We can use the estimates in Table 1 to decompose the sources of those long　cycles in PA/PM before 1800 (Figures 2 and 3), namely its sharp rise over the 16th century,　its equally sharp fall across the 17th century, and the rise again to 1800. Figure 8 presents　the movements in PAPM that according to equation (4) should have occurred as a result　of changes in land-labor ratios and TFP in the two sectors. As can be seen, the most　important influence on PA/PM appears indeed to have been total factor productivity in　agriculture. As mentioned above, movements in the land-labor ratio were working to　lower PAPM during the first fifty years of our sample, and to raise it thereafter, whereas　in fact PAPM rose and then fell. Similarly, movements in TFPMAN served to lower and　then raise PAPM, and were thus working in the ‘wrong direction’ for most of the period　as well. The rise and fall in PAPM is thus completely accounted for by the fall and rise of　TFPAG, at least until 1720 or so, when all three factors were serving to raise relative　food prices. 　22　 What about wage-rent ratios in pre-19th century Spain? In a closed economy, a　decline in land-labor ratios should lead to a fall in the wage-rent ratio, and for standard　Malthusian reasons. Rising industrial productivity, due either to rising capital-labor ratios　or to better industrial technology, should raise wage-rent ratios. The impact of better　agricultural productivity on wage-rent ratios will depend on whether it was labor-saving　or land-saving. Table 2 estimates these relationships by regressing the wage-rent ratio　(WAGERENT) on endowments (LANDLAB), industrial productivity (TFPMAN), and　agricultural productivity (TFPAG), for the years 1580-1800. (Once again, all variables　are expressed in natural logarithms.) As hypothesized, the wage-rent ratio is positively　related to the land-labor ratio (with an estimated elasticity of over 2.3 and a very high tstatistic). On the other hand, industrial TFP had no economy-wide impact on wage-rent　ratios, consistent with the heavily agricultural orientation of the Spanish economy at that　time. The wage-rent ratio was positively related to agricultural productivity (with an　estimated elasticity of about 0.9 and with very high t-statistics), suggesting that farmbased productivity-enhancing technical change, organizational change or output mix　change between arable and livestock tended to be labor-using and land-saving in premodern Spain. Interestingly, it was labor-saving and land-using for England during the　same period (O’Rourke and Williamson 2005), a result which is consistent with the　traditional literature on England, including the writings of Marx and Dobb. We urge　others to offer explanations for this difference in English and Spanish factor-saving　experience in agriculture. 　23　What Determined Spanish Commodity and Factor Price Trends After 1840?　Now consider the determinants of relative commodity and factor prices after　Spain went global some time in the 19th century. We analyze the issue econometrically　for the period 1840-1913. As we argued in section 2, this period was chosen since it　seems likely that the transition from a relatively closed economy to a relatively open one,　in which relative commodity prices were effectively de-linked from domestic　endowments, was only complete by about 1840. Our econometric analysis thus ignores　the 40 years or so during which Spain underwent this globalization transition.　As before, stationarity tests (both augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron)　indicate that wage-rent ratios, the relative price of food, and TFP in both manufacturing　and agriculture were stationary during this period. However, the same tests　unambiguously indicate that the land-labor ratio was non-stationary. The implication is　that the land-labor ratio cannot have been a determinant of either PAPM or WAGERENT　during this period. If relative commodity prices were no longer influenced by domestic　endowments, this was presumably because, in the relatively open Spanish economy of the　time, PAPM was primarily driven by world prices, and possibly Spanish tariff policies as　well. The question thus becomes, what was the impact of these exogenous relative　commodity prices on Spanish wage-rent ratios?　 Table 3 estimates a (log-linear) open-economy model of the wage-rent ratio over　the period 1840-1913. Once again simple OLS regressions are valid, given that all　variables are stationary, although in regressions (1) and (3) we include a time trend to　take account of any omitted variables, and in regressions (1) and (2) we include an AR(1)　correction for serial correlation. In an open economy, WAGERENT could still be a 　24　function of TFPAG and TFPMAN, but it should also be a function of relative commodity　prices PAPM, which are now taken as exogenous in a newly globalized world. The　specific factors trade model predicts that as the relative price of food declines, resources　should be transferred out of agriculture, and land rents (returns to the immobile factor)　should fall relative to wages (returns to the mobile factor): thus WAGERENT should be a　negative function of PAPM. The model is confirmed: the estimated elasticity of　WAGERENT with respect to PAPM ranges from -1.5 to -2.6, with very high t-statistics.　TFPMAN now has a positive impact on WAGERENT, with estimated elasticities ranging　from 1.3 to 2.8 and again with very high t-statistics. The fact that TFPMAN was now　having an effect on economy-wide factor prices is consistent with the growing　importance of manufacturing in Spain during this period: the share of Spanish　employment accounted for by manufacturing, mining and construction rose from 12.8%　in 1798 to 17.3% in 1860. Another important difference between the regression results　for the pre-1800 and post-1840 periods concerns the impact of TFPAG, which had a　positive impact on wage-rent ratios before 1800, but a negative impact after 1840, as　Table 3 shows. This suggests that technological progress in agriculture switched from　being labor-using and land-saving to being labor-saving and land-using, as was the case　in England. The new results are consistent with conventional narratives of the Industrial　Revolution, suggesting that unbalanced productivity growth favoring manufacturing　should have raised WAGERENT. 　25　6. Historical Counterfactuals　 We can now turn to the issue of what explained the post-1840 trends in Spanish　wage-rent ratios, in particular the rise through 1880 or so followed by the gradual decline　until the outbreak of World War I. In order to do this, we take our preferred econometric　specification in Table 3 (equation 1), and use it to ask three counterfactual questions.　First, how would Spanish wage-rent ratios have behaved if the relative price of　agricultural products (PA/PM) had remained constant between 1840 and 1913, rather than　rising until the mid-1880s and then declining? Second, what would have happened if total　factor productivity in Spanish manufacturing had remained constant after 1840, rather　than rising as it actually did (with notable interruptions in the early 1860s and following　the Spanish-American War)? And third, what would have happened if total factor　productivity in Spanish agriculture had remained constant after 1840, rather than　fluctuating as it did?　 Figure 9 provides the answers to these questions. The top panel plots the actual　movements in Spanish wage-rent ratios over the period (or more precisely, the predicted　values emerging from equation 1), as well as the three counterfactuals also generated　using that equation. ‘Constant TFPAG’ keeps TFPAG fixed at its 1840 level; ‘Constant　TFPMAN’ keeps TFPMAN fixed at its 1840 level; and ‘Constant PAPM’ keeps PAPM　fixed at its 1840 level. By comparing these three counterfactual with the actual series, the　contribution of each of these three independent variables to Spanish wage-rent ratios can　be assessed. These contributions are measured by the vertical distances between the　actual and counterfactual series, and are given in the lower panel of Figure 9. 　26　 The first point is that it would have made little difference to Spanish wage-rent　ratios if TFPAG had remained constant. This can be seen from the fact that the actual and　‘Constant TFPAG’ series are extremely close to each other throughout. The only point　when the two diverge significantly is around 1880-85, when agricultural TFP was at its　post-1840 nadir (Figure 7). The fact that the ‘Constant TFPAG’ series lies below the　actual series in the 1880s indicates that the agricultural TFP slump was raising wage-rent　ratios (as the negative coefficients on agricultural TFP in Table 3 indicate). For most of　the period, however, the movements in agricultural TFP were simply too modest to　matter much for economy-wide relative factor prices.　 TFP in manufacturing, on the other hand, seems to have had an important impact　on Spanish wage-rent ratios after 1840. Since TFPMAN was, for the most part, rising,　WAGERENT should have risen due to this effect alone (the coefficient on Textiles TFP　in Table 3 is positive). Thus, if manufacturing TFP had instead remained constant,　Spanish wage-rent ratios would have been lower than they actually were, and Figure 9　suggests that this effect was very large. The vertical distance between the actual and　‘Constant TFPMAM’ series (plotted separately in the lower panel of the Figure) rises to a　peak in 1860, before collapsing during the cotton famine; and then rises to another peak　just before the turn of the century, before narrowing again. Industrial progress was　serving to raise wage-rent ratios in Spain between 1840 and 1860, and again between the　mid-1860s and 1880. It continued on balance to contribute to rising wage-rent ratios　between 1880 and 1898, but then served to lower them thereafter. Movements in　industrial TFP can thus help explain wage-rent ratio growth between the mid-1860s and　1880, and declining wage-rent ratios after 1898, but in other periods industrial TFP 　27　movements were swamped by off-setting movements in PAPM. This was true between　1840 and 1860, and between 1880 and 1898.　 PAPM trends were broadly upward until the mid-1880s, and broadly downward　thereafter. Movements in PAPM should therefore have served to lower wage-rent ratios　between 1840 and 1885 or so, and to raise them thereafter. Between 1840 and 1860, it　seems that this negative PAPM effect was offset by the positive effect of TFP growth in　manufacturing, and the net effect was a relatively stable wage-rent ratio. Between 1865　and 1885, the increase in PAPM served to lower wage-rent ratios sharply, as evidenced　by the growing gap between the actual and ‘Constant TFPAG’ series in Figure 9.　However, this effect was dominated by the rising industrial TFP between 1865 and 1880,　with the agricultural TFP slump of the late 1870s and early 1880s playing a supporting　role. The net impact was thus rising wage-rent ratios. From 1880 until 1898, buoyant　PAPM put some slight downward pressure on wage-rent ratios, while it appears from the　bottom panel of Figure 9 that movements in TFPAG and TFPMAN were canceling each　other out. The net impact was thus a slight decline in wage-rent ratios. After 1898, falling　PAPM was serving to raise wage-rent ratios, but this was dominated by the off-setting　effects of falling manufacturing TFP.　 It appears that Spanish and English experience after 1840 was different in one　crucial respect: in Spain, movements in relative commodity prices and in industrial TFP　were nearly always having opposite effects on wage-rent ratios, whereas in England　rising industrial productivity and falling relative food prices both served to raise wagerent ratios. In the Spanish case, there are four distinct phases. In the first phase (1840-60),　industrial TFP growth raised WAGERENT, but PAPM rose in Spain sufficiently that 　28　there was no great movement in WAGERENT either way. In the second phase (1865-　1880), a rising PAPM continued to lower WAGERENT, but this effect was swamped by　the combined effects of a rising TFPMAN and a falling TFPAG, with the result that　Spanish wage-rent ratios rose during this period. In the third phase, movements in　sectoral TFPs cancelled each other out, and the slight fall in Spanish wage-rent ratios was　due to a continued high level of relative food prices (they rose prior to 1885 or so, and　fell thereafter). From 1898 onwards, falling Spanish food price should have raised wagerent ratios, like in Britain, but this effect was swamped by the economic effects of　Theodore Roosevelt’s implementation of his American manifest destiny, Spain’s loss of　her final American and Pacific possessions, and the resulting slump in Spanish　manufacturing as her old markets evaporated.　Finally, what would have happened if 19th century Spanish relative prices and　manufacturing productivity had behaved as they did in Britain? Figure 10 plots PAPM　and TFPMAN (in log form) for both countries between 1840 and 1913. As can be seen,　the long run trend in TFPMAN was very similar in the two countries, although the　Spanish series is far more volatile.3　 It follows that the long run trend in Spanish wagerent ratios would have been much the same if it had experienced British manufacturing　productivity growth. Figure 11 shows that this is indeed the case where the ‘English　TFPMAN’ counterfactual series is generated by substituting the English TFPMAN series　for the Spanish one in equation (1) of Table 3. As can be seen, this counterfactual series　is very close to the actual series (which repeats Figure 9).　　3　 The TFPMAN levels are not in the same units, so the higher TFPMAN for Spain is an artifact. Britain, of　course, had the technological edge in manufacturing at this time. 　29　 Relative prices are another matter. While PAPM fell in England after 1840, it rose　dramatically in Spain, at least until the 1880s (Figure 10). The implication is that Spanish　wage-rent ratios would have been much higher and would have increased after 1840 had　Spanish relative agricultural prices fallen as they did in Britain. Figure 11 shows this to　be the case (e.g. compare the ‘English prices’ counterfactual with the ‘actual’ series).　7. Concluding Remarks and an Agenda　 We began this paper by asking whether Spain’s relatively late industrial　revolution, and her far more hesitant embrace of freer trade, might have mattered for　Spanish income distribution trends, especially during the 19th century when countries like　Britain made such a dramatic break with the past. The answer is most definitely yes. Just　as with England, the sector-specific factors model provides a very good guide as to how　endowments and technology determined the evolution of relative commodity and factor　prices in Spain before 1800. Just as with England, endowments stopped determining　Spanish commodity and factor price trends some time in the mid-19th century, indicating　that Spain had switched to being a more open economy. Just as with England, industrial　revolutionary forces helped push wage-rent ratios up in Spain during the 19th century, and　just as with England wage-rent ratios were inversely related to the relative price of food,　yet another indication of the relevance of Heckscher-Ohlin and Stolper-Samuelson　economics for this phase of global economic history.　Why, then, did Spain not experience the same dramatic egalitarian rise in wagerent ratios between 1840 and 1913 that Britain and the Netherlands did? The answer lies 　30　with the fact that relative commodity prices and productivity growth in manufacturing　had off-setting effects on wage-rent ratios in Spain, while in Britain they were　reinforcing. For most of the post-1840 epoch, PAPM rose in Spain, instead of falling, and　this exerted a drag on Spanish wage-rent ratios, which counteracted the positive effect of　rising manufacturing productivity. When PAPM finally started falling after the 1880s,　Spanish manufacturing went into a slump. Why did Spanish relative food prices rise so　steeply up to the 1880s? Why did Spanish industrial productivity fall so sharply after the　1890s? Finally, to what extent was Spanish experience typical of the southern and eastern　European peripheries during this first great age of globalization? We need answers to all　three questions to understand the evolution of Spanish income distribution in the century　before 1913. 　31　References　R.

Álvarez Vázquez, Rentas, precios y crédito en Zamora en el Antiguo　Régimen (Zamora: Colegio Universitario de Zamora, 1987); L. J. Coronas Vida, La economía　agraria en tierras de Jaén 1500-1650 (Granada: Universidad de Granada, 1994); M. Duran,　Renda i producció agraria a Catalunya, segles XVI-XVIII (Barcelona: Phd Dissertation, 1984);　A. García Sanz, Desarrollo y crisis del Antiguo Régimen en Castilla la Vieja. Economía y　Sociedad en tierras de Segovia, 1500-1814 (Madrid: Akal, 1977); M. González Mariscal,　"Propiedades y rentas territoriales del cabildo de la catedral de Sevilla, 1524-1606. Primeros　resultados y reflexiones" (Santiago: Congreso de la Asociación de Historia Económica, 2005); E.　Llopis (personal communication); J. A. Sebastián Amarilla, “La renta de la tierra en León durante　la Edad Moderna. Primeros resultados y algunas reflexiones a partir de fuentes monásticas,”　Revista de Historia Económica 8 (1).　The procedure for constructing the series is: First, the original regional series, commonly for　wheat, have been converted into grams of silver with price data from E. J. Hamilton, American　Treasure and the Price Revolution in Spain, 1501-1650 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University　Press, 1934) and War and Prices in Spain, 1651-1800 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University　Press, 1947) and G. Feliu, Precios y salarios en la Cataluña moderna (Madrid: Banco de España,　1991), and silver content of coins from Feliu. Second, we have taken log-growth rates of silver　rents. Finally, we split these series into a national Divisia rent index with weights based on the　distribution of cultivated land by regions in Spain from J. Simpson, Spanish Agriculture: the　Long Siesta, 1765-1965 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995). When several series are　available for the same region (particularly Castile), we have taken an unweighted average of　them.　1.2 Nominal Rents: 1820-1913　Average agricultural land prices are taken from M. A. Bringas Gutiérrez, La Productividad de los　Factores en la Agricultura Española, 1752-1935 (Madrid: Banco de España, 2000). These prices　are converted into yearly series with data from M. A. Bringas Gutiérrez, I. Moral Arce, and M. J.　Roca Castro, "Una estimación del precio de la tierra en Cantabria, 1860-1936. Primer ensayo"　(Santiago: Congreso de la Asociación de Historia Económica, 2005). When data are not available　on a yearly basis, we interpolate linearly to get annual. Finally, the land price data has been　converted to rents by multiplying them by long-run interest rates. Interest rates are from P. Tedde　de Lorca, El Banco de San Carlos 1782-1829 (Madrid :Banco de España, 1988), P. Tedde de　Lorca, El Banco de San Fernando, 1829-1856 (Madrid: Alianza, 1999), and A. Carreras and X.　Tafunell , Historia Económica de la España Contemporánea (Barcelona: Ariel, 2003).　1.3 Nominal Daily Wage in Agriculture: 1568-1913　1568-1756: Unskilled building workers taken from D. Reher and E. Ballesteros, “Precios y　salarios en Castilla la Nueva: la construcción de un índice de salarios reales, 1509-1991,” Revista　de Historia Económica, XI, 1 (1993), pp. 101-151. All data were converted into silver content　with data from Feliu. 　40　1756-1913: Average wages for male agrarian journeymen taken from Bringas Gutiérrez. When　data are not available yearly, we have used the Reher and Ballesteros data on unskilled wages to　generate an annual series by means of Fisher indices.　1.4 Nominal Daily Wage in Textiles: 1568-1913　1568-1773: Barcelona’s bricklayers wages in silver taken from Feliu.　1773-1830: Average wage for cotton printing in Barcelona taken from N. Mora, “El poder　adquisitiu dels treballadors d’indianes a Barcelona, 1770-1816,” in S. Castillo and R. Fernández　(eds), Campesinos, artesanos, trabajadores (Lleida: Milenio, 2000), spliced with skilled building　wages taken from Reher and Ballesteros, then converted to silver with data taken from Feliu.　1830-1850: Average wages in Catalan textile industry from J. R. Rosés, The Early Phase of　Catalan industrialisation, 1830-1831 (Phd. Dissertation, European University Institute, Florence:　1998).　1850-1913: Average male and female wage in cotton textiles taken from La formación del　mercado de trabajo industrial en la Cataluña del siglo XIX (Madrid: Ministerio de Trabajo y　Seguridad Social, 1995).　1.5 Benefit Rates in Textiles: 1850-1913　Wage rate series augmented with data on benefits taken from Carreras and Tafunell.　2. Spanish PA/PM Series 1568-1913　2.1 Agricultural Price Indices (PA): 1568-1913　1563-1800: Price data are from Hamilton, American Treasure and War and Prices, converted into　silver using Feliu.　1800-1850: Price data are from Reher and Ballesteros and J. Moreno, “El nivel de vida en la　España atrasada entre 1800 y 1936. El caso de Palencia,” Investigaciones de Historia Económica　4 (2006), pp. 9-51, converted into silver using Feliu.　1850-1913: Price data are from L. Prados de la Escosura, El progreso económico de España,　1850-2000 (Madrid: Fundación BBVA, 2003).　2.2 Textile Price Indices (PM): 1568-1913　1563-1800: Textile prices throughout. We have constructed value added price indices by　subtracting from output prices intermediate prices multiplied by 0.35. Price data for outputs and　intermediates are from Hamilton, American Treasure and War and Prices, converted into silver　using Feliu.　1800-1850: Textile prices throughout. We employ the same method as with the earlier period.　Output price data are from Moreno and J. R. Rosés, “Industrialización regional sin crecimiento　nacional: La industrialización catalana y el crecimiento de la economía española (1830-1861),”　Revista de Historia Industrial, vol.45 (2004), pp. 49-80. Intermediate prices are from Rosés and　Estadísticas Históricas de España (Madrid: Fundación BBVA, 2005).　1850-1913: Price data are from L. Prados de la Escosura, El progreso económico de España,　1850-2000 (Madrid: Fundación BBVA, 2003). 　41　3. Spanish Population and Land Endowment 1580-1913　David Reher furnished us with his new calculations for Spanish population. Land endowments　are obtained from Bringas Gutiérrez. When data are not available on a yearly basis, we linearly　interpolated to get annual. 　42　Table 1.
